High-rate sputter deposition of electrochromic nickel oxide thin films using substrate cooling and water vapor injection
Nickel oxide is a promising electrochromic (EC) material because it changes color upon electrochemical oxidation and reduction. In this study, the authors developed a reactive sputtering technique using water vapor as a reactive gas to deposit highly hydrated oxide thin films. They used an Ar+H_{2}O gas mixture, with H_{2}O injected directly onto the substrate surface. Subsequently, the authors studied the effects of substrate cooling on the mechanism of Ni oxide thin film formation and how this process affected the EC properties of the resulting Ni oxide thin films. At substrate temperatures of −80 and −120 °C, amorphous hydrated Ni oxide thin films were deposited with a high deposition rate of approximately 35 nm/min, which was greater than that of metallic Ni films. It was surmised that the metallic target mode was achieved at low substrate temperatures in the Ar+H_{2}O atmosphere. The Ni oxide films exhibited good EC properties with a large transmittance change. Consequently, substrate cooling and water vapor injection were found to be effective in the high-rate deposition of Ni oxide thin films with good EC properties.
I. INTRODUCTION
Electrochromic (EC) materials, which change color upon electrochemical oxidation and reduction, have been used in automobile rearview mirrors, smart windows, and displays [1,2]. Nickel oxide is a promising inorganic EC material, and transparent Ni(OH)_{2} can be reversibly transformed into brown NiOOH by the following reaction [3,4]:
Nickel oxide thin films have been prepared by various techniques such as sol-gel dip-coating [5], anodic deposition [6], sputtering [7,8], and pulsed laser deposition [9], and their EC properties have been intensively studied.
Recently, reactive sputtering techniques employing water vapor (H_{2}O) as a reactive gas have been developed and used to deposit active EC oxide thin films [10–15]. The EC properties of the Ni oxide thin films deposited in a H_{2}O atmosphere have been found to be superior to those of similar films deposited in an O_{2} atmosphere. According to Thornton's structural zone model for sputtered thin films [16], substrate temperature is an important process parameter used to control the film structure, and porous films are predicted to be formed at low substrate temperatures. Low-density, porous films are considered to be preferable for EC applications due to enhanced ion diffusion in the films [4]. Although studies of sputter deposition of metal and carbon thin films at liquid nitrogen (LN_{2}) temperatures have been reported [17–21], similar reports of low-temperature deposition of oxide thin films are scarce. In our previous study, Ni oxide films were sputter-deposited onto substrates cooled by LN_{2} using H_{2}O as a reactive gas [22]. Although the EC properties of the sample films were poor, a relatively high deposition rate was obtained. In the present study, we investigated the effects of substrate temperature in more detail to prepare Ni oxide thin films that exhibited good EC properties and the mechanism of the reaction process was discussed.
II. EXPERIMENT
A. Sample preparation
Ni oxide thin films with a thickness of approximately 100 nm were deposited on Si, glass, and indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates using the RF magnetron sputtering system described in our previous paper [22]. A Ni metal target (50 mm in diameter, 1 mm in thickness, and 99.9% purity) was sputtered in Ar, O_{2}, and Ar+H_{2}O atmospheres. Substrates were cooled using LN_{2} and heated using a Peltier device, which allowed the substrate temperature to be varied from −170 to −80 °C. For comparison, Ni oxide films were also deposited at room temperature (RT) with no substrate cooling or heating. In our preliminary experiment, H_{2}O partial pressure in the sputtering chamber was found to decrease markedly when the H_{2}O molecules condensed on the LN_{2} tank. Therefore, to preclude this problem, H_{2}O was injected directly onto the substrate surface. Similar methods using a reactive gas inlet at the substrate surface have been examined to study the mechanism of reactive sputtering of Al, Ti, Zn, and Ta oxide thin films [23,24]. The flow rates of the Ar, O_{2}, and H_{2}O gases were controlled using mass flow controllers and maintained at Ar 2.5 cm^{3}/min (ccm) + H_{2}O 2.5 ccm, Ar 2.5 ccm, and O_{2} 2.5 ccm for the sputtering atmospheres of the Ar+H_{2}O gas mixture, pure Ar, and pure O_{2}, respectively. The total sputtering gas pressure and RF power were maintained constant at 6.7 Pa and 50 W, respectively. In this study, we used a higher H_{2}O flow rate, sputtering gas pressure, and RF power than those used in our previous paper [22] to enhance oxidation of sputtered Ni atoms and obtain higher deposition rates.
B. Sample characterization
The resulting film thickness was measured using a stylus profiler (Alpha-Step D-500, KLA-Tencor). The deposition rate was calculated from the film thickness and sputtering time. The crystal structure and chemical bonding state of the films were characterized by x-ray diffraction (Ultima IV, RIGAKU) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (FT/IR-6100, JASCO), respectively. The optical properties of the films were studied by UV-Vis spectroscopy (U-2910, HITACHI). The EC properties of the films were examined in an aqueous 1 M potassium hydroxide (KOH) electrolyte solution, and the in situ transmittance change was measured using a charge-coupled device multichannel detector (USB2000+, Ocean Optics), a halogen lamp, and an electrochemical measurement system (HSV-100, HOKUTO DENKO). Air and a quartz-glass cell filled with aqueous electrolyte solution were used as references for the transmittance measurements using U-2910 and USB2000+, respectively. In the electrochemical test cell, Pt and Ag/AgCl were used as counter and reference electrodes, respectively. All measurements were conducted at RT in ambient air.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Deposition rate
First, the deposition rates of the films formed at different substrate temperatures in Ar+H_{2}O, Ar, and O_{2} atmospheres were studied, whose results are shown in Fig. 1. The deposition rates of the films formed in Ar and O_{2} were 20–25 and 3–4 nm/min, respectively. The deposition rates of the films formed in an O_{2} atmosphere were one-sixth to one-eighth less than those deposited in Ar, which was considered to result from the oxidation of the surface of the metallic Ni target by O_{2} [25,26]. By contrast, the films formed in Ar+H_{2}O at −120 and −80 °C exhibited deposition rates greater than those of the films formed in Ar. In the former case, a maximum deposition rate of approximately 35 nm/min was obtained. The deposition rate at RT in Ar+H_{2}O decreased to a value comparable to that in O_{2}. This result strongly suggests that the Ni target surface was in a metallic state when the substrate was cooled and H_{2}O was injected onto the substrate surface. The higher deposition rates of the films deposited in Ar+H_{2}O than those of the films deposited in Ar at −120 and −80 °C correspond to the difference in the film composition described in Sec. III B. The excess H_{2}O molecules that did not react with Ni atoms were believed to be condensed on the LN_{2} tank surface, which acted as a cryopump for the water vapor in the sputtering system. The local pressure of H_{2}O near the Ni target was sufficiently low to maintain the target surface in a metallic state, as shown in Fig. 2.
B. XRD, FTIR, and transmittance
Next, the structure, chemical bonding state, and optical properties of the films deposited in the Ar+H_{2}O atmosphere at different substrate temperatures were studied. The XRD patterns of the films deposited on Si substrates are shown in Fig. 3. As shown in this figure, a diffraction peak attributed to fcc Ni (111) [27] and peaks resulting from NiO (111) and (200) [28] can be observed for the films deposited at −170 °C and RT. By contrast, no remarkable peaks were observed for the films deposited at −120 and −80 °C. Figure 4 shows the FTIR spectra of the films deposited on Si substrates. The IR transmittances of the films deposited at −120 °C, −80 °C, and RT were high, and absorption peaks due to the OH and Ni–O bonds could be clearly observed [29]. In contrast, the transmittance of the film deposited at −170 °C was low, and no marked absorption peaks were observed. The UV-Vis transmittance spectra of the films deposited on glass substrates at temperatures between −120 °C and RT were high, while the transmittance of the film deposited at −170 °C was very low, as shown in Fig. 5.
These results strongly suggest that hydrated Ni oxide (NiO·nH_{2}O) and/or Ni hydroxide [Ni(OH)_{2}] thin films were formed on the substrate at temperatures between −120 °C and RT and mixed films of Ni metal and Ni oxide were formed at −170 °C. It was assumed that the oxidation of Ni was incomplete, and hence, some Ni atoms remained in the metallic state at −170 °C [22]. Previous studies on the reaction between the Ni metal surface and water vapor at different temperatures indicated that H_{2}O molecules physisorbed at low temperatures (below 150 K) and dissociated into adsorbed atomic oxygen and hydrogen gas at higher temperatures [30,31]. The difference of the reaction mechanisms may induce the change in the composition of the films deposited at different substrate temperatures. The molar volumes of fcc Ni, cubic NiO, and Ni(OH)_{2} (theophrastite) are calculated to be 6.6, 11.0, and 23.6 cm^{3}/mol, respectively, from their densities [27,28,32]. The larger molar volumes of NiO and Ni(OH)_{2} than that of Ni are considered to be the reason for the higher deposition rate of the Ni oxide films deposited in Ar+H_{2}O at −120 and −80 °C shown in Fig. 1 although we could not characterize their chemical composition precisely.
C. EC properties
Finally, the EC properties of the films deposited on ITO-coated glass substrates in Ar+H_{2}O were examined in an aqueous KOH electrolyte solution. Figure 6 shows cyclic voltammograms of the films in a potential scan range between −0.3 and +0.5 V (versus Ag/AgCl) with a potential scan rate of 20 mV/s. The films deposited at −120 and −80 °C exhibited high electrochemical activity with large current densities. The bleached and colored transmittance spectra of the films were measured after applying constant potentials of −0.3 and +0.5 V (versus Ag/AgCl), respectively, for 1 min, and the results are shown in Fig. 7. The transmittance of the film deposited at −170 °C was low, probably due to the incorporation of metallic Ni atoms in the films. In contrast, higher bleached transmittances and larger transmittance changes were observed for the films deposited at −120 and −80 °C, and a maximum width of 65% in the change in transmittance was obtained at a wavelength of 600 nm. It was believed that amorphous and low-density Ni oxide films were formed at −120 and −80 °C and ion diffusion into the films was enhanced, which produced these good EC properties. Some differences in the spectra shown in Figs. 5 and 7 are thought to be caused by the differences of the measurement system, substrates, and references used for the transmittance measurements.
From these experimental results, our new reactive sputtering technique was considered to be a promising method for forming EC Ni oxide thin films at a high deposition rate.
IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Ni oxide thin films were prepared by reactive sputtering in an Ar+H_{2}O atmosphere at substrate temperatures of −80 and −120 °C, which produced a high deposition rate of approximately 35 nm/min. These films were believed to be deposited in the metallic target mode because the excess H_{2}O molecules in the spray condensed on the LN_{2} cooling tank. The EC properties of the Ni oxide films were superior to those of the films deposited at RT and −170 °C. The reactive sputtering technique using substrate cooling and water vapor injection is considered to be a promising method for fabricating EC Ni oxide thin films.
