Analysis of a Bianchi-like equation satisfied by the Mars-Simon tensor
The Mars-Simon tensor (MST), which, e.g., plays a crucial role to provide gauge invariant characterizations of the Kerr-NUT-(A)(dS) family, satisfies a Bianchi-like equation. In this paper, we analyze this equation in close analogy to the Bianchi equation, in particular it will be shown that the constraints are preserved supposing that a generalized Buchdahl condition holds. This permits the systematic construction of solutions to this equation in terms of a well-posed Cauchy problem. A particular emphasis lies on the asymptotic Cauchy problem, where data are prescribed on a space-like I (i.e., for ∧ > 0). In contrast to the Bianchi equation, the MST equation is of Fuchsian type at I, for which existence and uniqueness results are derived.
I. INTRODUCTION
The Kerr-NUT-(A)(dS) family plays a distinguished role among solutions to Einstein’s field equations: Not merely is it an explicitly known family of vacuum solutions but it is also expected that, e.g., the Kerr subfamily satisfies certain black hole uniqueness and stability results. In fact for the Kerr-de Sitter family stability has recently been established [20], while uniqueness is still open.
While the explicit form of the solutions employs coordinates which are adapted to the symmetries, it is equally important to have gauge invariant characterizations at hand. One approach to accomplish this is based on the so-called Mars-Simon tensor (MST) [21,25,26,28,37], which may be regarded as a generalization of the conformal Weyl tensor in spacetimes which admit a Killing vector: Given a vacuum solution of the Einstein equations with cosmological constant Λ, the vanishing of the Weyl tensor shows that the spacetime is locally Minkowski or (anti-)de Sitter, respectively. Similarly, the vanishing of the MST implies that the spacetime is locally given by a certain explicitly known family of solutions, classified in Ref [28], which contains in particular the Kerr-NUT-(A)dS family.
It turns out that the MST satisfies an equation very similar to the Bianchi equation which is satisfied by the Weyl tensor. This “MST equation”, which has been derived in Ref [21] for Λ = 0 and in Ref [27] for arbitrary signs of Λ, played an important role in the derivation of Kerr uniqueness results [1,21], and in a characterization of Λ > 0-vacuum spacetimes in terms of their asymptotic Cauchy data on I [27]. In fact, the motivation for this paper comes from the latter one: In contrast to the Bianchi equation, the MST equation (or rather its analog in an appropriately conformally rescaled spacetime) is not regular near a smooth space-like I. Instead, the equation is shown there to be of Fuchsian type.
The MST equation can be split into a symmetric hyperbolic system of evolution equations and a system of constraint equations [27]. As for the Bianchi equation, we will show that the constraints are preserved under evolution, supposing that a certain generalized Buchdahl condition holds. Given a solution to the constraints on some Cauchy surface, the existence of a solution to the full system follows from standard results. When the initial hypersurface is a space-like I, though, the Cauchy problem becomes more involved due to the Fuchsian character of the system at I. In Ref [27] uniqueness of solutions which extend smoothly through I with regular data at I has been proved. It is a main goal of this paper to analyze in detail the behavior of solutions near I and establish a well-posedness result for this singular initial value problem (by contrast, it is easy to solve the constraints on I, whereas they are more involved on an ordinary Cauchy surface of the physical spacetime).
We tackle the singular initial value problem by means of the Fuchsian technique. Earlier Fuchsian techniques by Rendall and co-authors, which were later applied to problems in general relativity [5,12,15,19,22,23], were restricted to the real-analytic setting. The first attempts to overcome the analyticity restriction were made in Refs [14] and  [35]. A series of papers [2–4,7–10] led to a version of the Fuchsian technique which applies to a general class of quasilinear hyperbolic equations without the analyticity restriction.
We study the MST equation on a given background, and a solution thereof will generally not coincide with the MST of the background spacetime. The reasons why this is interesting are basically the same as for the Bianchi equation: A solution to the Bianchi equation is in one-to-one correspondence with a solution to the linearized Einstein equations (at least for Λ = 0), and a similar result should be expected for a solution to the MST equation on a background with vanishing MST (we will only partially address this issue). Moreover, the importance of the Bianchi equation arises from its appearance as part of Friedrich’s conformal field equations [17]; one might think of a similar system of equations where the MST equation replaces the Bianchi equation in order to study certain classes of perturbations of spacetimes which admit a Killing vector field [e.g., since the (conformally rescaled) MST is much better behaved near the poles of a Kerr-de Sitter I than the (conformally rescaled) Weyl tensor]. Analyzing this equation on a given background then provides a toy model for this.
While the Bianchi equation is meaningful on any background spacetime, the MST equation can only be posed on a background which admits a Killing vector field. However, due to the Buchdahl condition, well-posedness results for the Bianchi equation are only available on locally conformally flat backgrounds. Corresponding results for the MST equation permit a larger class of background spacetimes, namely, those with vanishing MST such as the Kerr-NUT-(A)dS family.
The structure of the paper is as follows: In Sec. II, we recall the definition of the MST. In Sec. III, we review a couple of results on the Bianchi equation as a guideline for our analysis of the MST equation. Section IV is devoted to the study of the MST equation. More precisely, in Sec. IV A we will prove that the linearized MST satisfies the MST equation on a background with vanishing MST. In Sec. IV C, we will establish a generalized Buchdahl condition which ensures that the constraints, which are identified in Sec. IV B, are preserved under evolution.
In Sec. V, we will consider the analog of the MST equation in Penrose’s conformally rescaled spacetimes. We then restrict attention to the case where the cosmological constant is positive so that I is space-like. The behavior of the constraint and evolution equations near I is unveiled in Sec. V B.
In Sec. VI, we solve the singular initial value problem of the MST equations with data on I^{−}. In Sec. VI A, we establish some basic notation, list our assumptions, and formulate the main theorem, Theorem 6.1. The remainder of Sec. VI is devoted to the proof of that theorem. Section VI B provides a detailed study of a particular matrix in the evolution equations which largely determines the leading singular behavior of solutions at I^{−}. In Sec. VI C, we investigate the evolution equation of the remainder of the singular initial value problem and establish certain decay conditions. The leading-order term for the singular initial value problem is derived in Sec. VI D. By that stage we will have identified the singular data and established a local existence theory for the singular initial value problem of the evolution equations. In Sec. VI E, we then find conditions on the singular data which guarantee that the asserted family of solutions of the evolution equations also satisfies the constraints. Finally, we show in Sec. VI F that the same conditions also imply that the solutions extend smoothly through I^{−} once an overall singular term expected for generic MSTs has been subtracted. Notice here that according to the general structure of the singular data, generic solutions of the evolution equations do not have this property.
A. Notation
For the convenience of the reader let us finish the Introduction with some remarks concerning the notation. The “physical” spacetime, solution to Einstein’s vacuum field equations with cosmological constant Λ, will be denoted by (M, g). Throughout this paper we assume (M, g) to be a smooth 3 + 1-dimensional connected, oriented, and time-oriented Lorentzian manifold with signature (−, +, +, +). Its associated Levi-Civita covariant derivative, connection coefficients, and volume form are denoted by ∇_{μ}, Γμνα, and η_{μνσρ}, respectively. Our conventions concerning Riemann tensor, Ricci tensor, etc., follow those in Ref [38].
The conformally rescaled counterpart of (M, g) will be denoted by (M̃,g̃). Correspondingly, objects associated with g̃ are decorated with a tilde, ∇̃{μ}, Γ̃μνα, and η̃{μνσρ}.
Spacetime indices are Greek. Coordinates in 3 + 1 splits are denoted by {x^{μ}} = {t ≡ x^{0}, x^{i}} with corresponding tensorial indices. Objects associated with the family t ↦ g_{ij}(t, x^{k}) of Riemannian metrics are marked with a slash, ∇_{i}, Γ̸ijk, and ∇_{ijk}. The action of ∇_{i}on spacetime tensors is defined as follows:
and similarly for tensors of higher rank. Again, the corresponding objects associated with the family t↦g̃{ij}(t,x^{k}) in the conformally rescaled spacetime are decorated with a tilde.
For Λ > 0 and in spacetimes with an appropriate fall-off behavior of the gravitational field, (past) null infinity is represented in (M̃,g̃) by a space-like hypersurface I^{−}. The Riemannian metric induced by g̃{μν} on I^{−} will be denoted by h_{ij}, its covariant derivative by D_{i}, and the volume form by ϵ_{ijk} (the only exception will be Sec. III B, where D_{i} and ϵ_{ijk} denote covariant derivative and volume form of the induced metric on an arbitrary Cauchy surface).
II. MARS-SIMON TENSOR (MST)
Let (M, g) be a Λ-vacuum spacetime which admits a Killing vector field X. The Mars-Simon tensor (MST), cf. Refs [21] and  [37], is defined as follows:
where
In these expressions η_{μνσρ} is the volume form of g and ⋆ is the corresponding Hodge dual. C_{μνσρ} and F_{μν} are the self-dual Weyl tensor and the self-dual Killing form. They satisfy Cμνσρ⋆=−iC_{μνσρ} and Fμν⋆=−iF_{μν}. The symmetric double two-form I_{μνσρ} provides a metric in the space of self-dual two-forms in the sense that I_{μνσρ}W^{σρ}=W_{μν} for any self-dual two-form W_{μν}. Some useful identities satisfied by self-dual tensors can be found, e.g., in Refs [21] and  [24].
The MST is a Weyl field, i.e., it has all the algebraic symmetries of the Weyl tensor,
Moreover, its Lie derivative along the associated Killing vector X vanishes
supposing that Q satisfies L_{X}Q=0 (as it is the case for the Q defined below).
In the literature different definitions of the function Q:M↦C have proven to be advantageous in different contexts [21,27,28,32]. All the different choices for Q are obtained by requiring a certain component of the MST (or a derivative thereof) to vanish and are therefore equivalent in spacetimes where the MST vanishes (supposing that certain quantities are non-zero). Here we are interested in the Bianchi-like equations satisfied by the MST, and this requires a particular choice for the function Q [28],
and where σ denotes the Ernst potential of the closed 1-form
In general the Ernst potential exists only locally and is defined only up to an additive complex constant. In this paper, we will eventually restrict attention to background spacetimes with vanishing MST and in that case the Ernst 1-form is exact and the additive constant is determined by the requirement on the MST to vanish [28].
The definition of the complex square roots depends on the sign of the cosmological constant. For Λ > 0 (the case which we are primarily interested in), the square root is preferably chosen in such a way that the real part of R approaches minus infinity at I, in agreement with the usual behavior for, e.g., the Kerr-de Sitter family in Boyer-Lindquist type coordinates (cf. Ref [27] for more details). With the signs chosen in (2.10)–(2.12) this is achieved by taking the positive branch, i.e., the one that takes positive real numbers and gives positive real values.
In Ref [27] this choice for Q was denoted by Q_{ev}. Since we assume Q = Q_{ev} throughout the paper, no confusion arises and we will simply write Q henceforth.
Proposition 2.1 (Ref [27], cf. Ref [21] for the Λ = 0-case). Let (M, g, X) be a Λ-vacuum spacetime with Killing vector field X such that
Then the MST (2.1) with Q given by (2.10) satisfies the Bianchi-like equation
where
Remark 2.2. J(S){αβμ} has the following properties [27]:
It is further self-dual in the first pair of anti-symmetric indices.
III. BIANCHI EQUATION
The MST has the same algebraic symmetries as the Weyl tensor and fulfills an equation similar, though more complicated, to the Bianchi equation for the Weyl tensor. In fact, the MST was introduced as a generalization of the Weyl tensor in Λ-vacuum spacetimes which admit a Killing vector field: Its vanishing (supplemented by certain additional conditions) provides a local gauge-independent characterization of the Kerr-(A)(dS) family in much the same way as the vanishing of the Weyl tensor provides a local characterization of Minkowski and (anti-)de Sitter spacetime, respectively [25,26,28].
While the MST equation comes along with some additional features such as the Fuchsian behavior near a space-like I, a couple of results which hold for the Bianchi equation can be derived for the MST equation, as well. Even more, the analysis of the Bianchi equation provides a guideline how to analyze the MST equation and what results should be expected. It is the aim of this section to review some crucial results on the Bianchi equation.
Consider a spacetime (M, g) which satisfies the vacuum equations R_{μν} = Λg_{μν}. Then the Weyl tensor of g satisfies the Bianchi equation
Now, given a Λ-vacuum spacetime (M, g), it is of interest to analyze this equation on that given background and construct solutions from appropriate initial surfaces:
(i) First of all the Bianchi equation is part of Friedrich’s conformal field equations (cf. Ref [17]) which replace Einstein’s vacuum field equations in a setting where the metric is conformally rescaled. Analyzing (3.1) on a background therefore provides a kind of toy model for these equations.
(ii) On a conformally flat background, solutions to the linearized field equations provide solutions to the Bianchi equation, cf. Lemma 3.1. Even more, solutions to (3.1) turn out to be in one-to-one correspondence with solutions to the linearized field equations [to our knowledge, this result has only been established on a flat background so far, cf. Lemma 3.2, though an analog result should be expected on an (anti-)de Sitter background, as well].
A. Linearized gravity
Let us elaborate somewhat more detailed on (ii). We consider a Lorentzian metric η and denote by
a perturbation thereof. In the following, we will decorate all fields related to the background metric η with superscript (0). The curvature tensor associated with the metric g takes the form (cf. Ref [13])
Two perturbations h and h′ describe the same physical perturbation if and only if there exists a one-form ξ such that hμν′−h_{μν}=∇_{μ}ξ_{ν}. It is convenient to employ this gauge freedom
to impose the gauge condition
It is preserved under evolution of the linearized Einstein equations (3.11). Assuming further that the background metric satisfies the Λ-vacuum equations, we obtain from (3.3) (□_{η}≔η^{μν}∇μ(0)∇ν(0))
whence
and one easily computes the Weyl tensor associated with g,
It follows from (3.7) that the linearized Einstein equations on a vacuum background (M, η) read
Let us now assume that the linearized field equations (3.11) are satisfied. Then the Weyl tensor (3.10) has the expansion
where
We compute the divergence. Using the linearized equations (3.11), the gauge condition (3.5), and the Bianchi equation for the background metric, we obtain
That yields the well-known (cf. Ref [39])
Lemma 3.1. Let (M, η) be a Λ-vacuum spacetime and let h be a solution to the linearized vacuum equations. Then the linearized Weyl tensorCμνσρ(lin)associated with the perturbation g = η + h satisfies the Bianchi equation,∇ρ(0)Cμνσ{ρ}(lin)=0, supposing that the background metric η is locally conformally flat.The converse is also true (at least for vanishing cosmological constant). The proof can be found, e.g., in Ref [6].
Lemma 3.2. Let (M, η) be a Minkowski background, and let C_{μνσρ}be a solution to the Bianchi equation∇ρ(0)Cμνσ{ρ}=0with all the algebraic symmetries of the Weyl tensor. Then there exists a unique [up to gauge transformations (3.4)] perturbation h which satisfies the linearized vacuum equations (3.11) such that C_{μνσρ}is the linearized Weyl tensor of g = η + h.
B. Cauchy problem and Buchdahl condition
Having a motivation at hand that the Bianchi equation on a given background is of interest by itself, one would to like establish well-posedness of the associated Cauchy problem.
Let Σ ⊂ M be a Cauchy surface in (M, η), and introduce Gaussian coordinates (t ≡ x^{0}, x^{i}) near Σ. Taking the algebraic symmetries of the Weyl tensor into account, it is easy to check that the Bianchi equation is equivalent to the system (⋆ denotes the Hodge dual)
One checks that (3.15) forms a symmetric hyperbolic system of evolution equations, for which standard well-posedness results are available. The system (3.16) does not contain transverse derivatives and therefore provides a system of constraint equations. It requires the initial data C_{μνσρ}|_{Σ} to satisfy the following constraint equations:
This is equivalent to the existence of a complex symmetric trace-free tensor E_{ij}≔C_{0i0j}+iC0i0j⋆|_{Σ} which solves
where D_{i} and ϵ_{ijk} denote the covariant derivative and the volume form of the induced metric on Σ, while K_{ij}=12L_{∂t}g_{ij} denotes the second fundamental form. To solve this constraint one may employ York’s splitting method: Here E_{ij} is written in the form
where the symmetric, trace-free tensor B_{ij} provides certain prescribed “seed” data. The constraint equation (3.18) then becomes a linear elliptic partial differential equation (PDE) system for the complex vector field Y. In the time-symmetric case, for instance, solving the constraint equations simply amounts to the construction of symmetric trace-free and divergence-free tensors on the initial surface.
One then needs to make sure that (3.17) is preserved under evolution. It turns out that this is the case if and only if the Buchdahl condition [11] holds,
which is certainly the case whenever the background metric η is locally conformally flat or when C_{μνσρ} is the Weyl tensor associated with η. In the latter case, this is obvious for the first condition in (3.20), and for the second we have
To sum it up, the Bianchi equation, regarded as an equation on a given background (M, η), is of particular relevance whenever (M, η) is locally conformally flat. In that case the Buchdahl condition is satisfied and solutions are obtained from data on some Cauchy surface Σ ⊂ M if and only if these data satisfy the constraint equations (3.17).
IV. BIANCHI-LIKE EQUATION FOR THE MST
In this section we will carry out a similar analysis for the Bianchi-like equation (2.16) satisfied by the MST as we did for the Bianchi equation in Sec. III.
A. Linearized MST
First of all we would like to derive an analog of Lemma 3.1. This is to explore the analogies between the Bianchi and the MST equation, but, even more important, we would like to provide a motivation to analyze the MST equation on a given background. It seems likely that there is an analog of Lemma 3.2 which we have not explored here.
Since the computations turn out to be fairly lengthy, we will restrict attention to the case of a vanishing cosmological constant
Nonetheless, we expect a corresponding result to hold for Λ ≠ 0 as well. This is to be analyzed elsewhere.
Let us assume we have been given a Λ = 0-vacuum spacetime (M, η) which admits a Killing vector field X^{(0)}. In this setting (2.15) and (2.16) simplify to
We want to analyze under which conditions the linearized MST Sμνσρ(lin) of the perturbed metric g = η + h satisfies this equation, when h is some perturbation which satisfies the linearized vacuum equations
As before we will impose the gauge condition (3.5),
To define the MST of the perturbed metric g, it needs to admit a Killing vector field X. In fact, to determine a linearization it is sufficient to have a vector field which satisfies the Killing equation up to and including the linear order in the perturbation h. As before, we denote by X^{(0)} the Killing vector of (M, η). We write X as X = X^{(0)} + X^{(lin)} + O(h^{2}). Since
we need to assume that the perturbation η + h admits a vector field X^{(lin)} such that
which we assume henceforth.
A solution to (4.2) will be required to be self-dual with respect to the background η, while the MST associated with g will be self-dual with respect to g. In general these two notions only coincide in the leading order. In other words, the linearized MST of g will certainly be self-dual with respect to η if the MST associated with the background metric η vanishes (we have indicated in the formula with respect to which metric the Hodge dual is taken),
For the remainder of this section we will thus assume
This is in accordance with the Bianchi equation where we needed to assume the vanishing of the Weyl tensor of the background metric in order to derive an analog result (note that the vanishing of the Weyl tensor is equivalent to the vanishing of the self-dual Weyl tensor).
Remark 4.1. Λ-vacuum spacetimes with vanishing MST (4.7) have been classified in Refs [28] and  [29]. This class includes in particular the Kerr-NUT-(A)(dS) family. So while, compared to the Bianchi equation, the class of admissible perturbations is restricted to those which preserve a symmetry, the class of admissible background spacetimes is much larger.Let us now determine the linearization of the MST
The linearized Weyl tensor has already been given in (3.13). We deduce that its self-dual counterpart satisfies (for Λ = 0)
where (vαβ){tf} denotes the η-trace-free part of the corresponding two-tensor. Moreover,
and, employing (4.6),
where
denotes the self-dual two-form associated with X^{(lin)}.It remains to determine the linearization of Q = Q^{(0)} + Q^{(lin)} + O(h^{2}). Unfortunately, this term cannot be computed explicitly. It follows from the definition of Q (2.10) that
whence Q^{(lin)} satisfies the differential equation
From these expansions we determine the linearization of the MST. After some simplifications we find that
and Q^{(lin)} is given by (4.18). With regard to (4.2) we also compute the following contraction:
where we employed one more time the vanishing of the MST of the background metric.Before we proceed, let us collect a couple of useful relations satisfied by Fμν(0) in any Λ = 0-vacuum spacetime (M, η, X^{(0)}) with vanishing MST [28],
Let V_{αβ} be an antisymmetric tensor, V_{αβ}=V_{αβ}+iVαβ⋆ be its self-dual counterpart, and W_{αβ} be self-dual, then (using the properties of the Levi-Civita symbol)
From (4.6) we deduce
whence
Finally, we need to determine the linearization of the divergence of the MST. First of all we deduce from the linearized Einstein equations (3.11) and the gauge condition (3.5),
Then a rather lengthy calculation which employs (3.11) and (3.5), the vanishing of the background MST (to express the self-dual-Weyl tensor in terms of F_{αβ}) as well as the relations (4.21)–(4.25) and (4.28)–(4.30) reveals that
Let us consider the term in brackets in the first two lines somewhat more carefully. The tensor
is manifestly antisymmetric in its first and last pair of indices. One checks that it is also trace-free,
by the linearized field equations (3.11) and the gauge condition (3.5). This implies that
To see this, we observe that, applying η^{(0)μνκρ}, (4.35) is equivalent to η^{(0)μνκρ}ηαβγδ(0)Ξμν{γδ}=4Ξαβ{κρ}, which in turn follows from the tracelessness of Ξ_{αβμν},
It follows that the term in brackets vanishes,
Finally, from (4.19) and (4.20) we compute
and one readily checks that
We have proved:
Proposition 4.2. Let (M, η, X^{(0)}) be a Λ = 0-vacuum spacetime with a Killing vector X^{(0)}such that the associated MST vanishes. Let h be a vacuum perturbation of η such that η + h admits a Killing vector which is a perturbation of X^{(0)}, i.e., which satisfiesL_{X^{(0)}}h_{μν}+2∇μ(0)Xν(lin)=0for some perturbation X^{(lin)} of X^{(0)}. Then the linearized MST associated with (M, η + h, X^{(0)} + X^{(lin)}) satisfies the MST equation (4.2) on the background (M, η, X^{(0)}).
Remark 4.3. As indicated above, one should expect this result to hold for any sign of the cosmological constant.
Remark 4.4. We have not attempted to derive an analog of Lemma 3.2. Nevertheless, we expect that a solution S_{αβμν} to the MST equation on a vacuum background (M, η, X^{(0)}) with vanishing MST defines a unique [up to gauge transformations (3.4)] perturbation h of η and X^{(lin)} of X^{(0)} such that the linearized vacuum equations (3.11) and L_{X^{(0)}}h_{μν}+2∇μ(0)Xν(lin)=0 are fulfilled and such that S_{αβμν} is the linearized MST of (M, η + h, X^{(0)} + X^{(lin)}). Note, though, that in Lemma 3.2 a vanishing cosmological constant has been assumed, so before considering this issue for the MST with Λ ≠ 0, the corresponding issue for the Bianchi equation should be analyzed.
B. Constraint and evolution equations
Let Σ ⊂ M be a Cauchy surface in some Λ-vacuum spacetime (M, g) which admits a Killing vector X. Later on, when we work in a conformally rescaled spacetime g̃=Θ^{2}g, we will introduce Gaussian coordinates, at this stage, though, we merely assume coordinates (t ≡ x^{0}, x^{i}) near Σ where
Remark 4.5. In Sec. III A, we have denoted the background spacetime by (M, η, X^{(0)}), and the associated fields have been decorated with superscript (0). Since from now on the background spacetime will be the only one we are working with, we will simply denote it by (M, g, X) henceforth without any superscripts marking the associated fields. However, we will still denote any solution of the MST equation (2.15) by S_{αβμν}. The MST associated with the spacetime (M, g, X) will be denoted by S_{αβμν}.It follows readily from the algebraic symmetries of S_{αβμν} and its self-duality that the MST equation is equivalent to the system (cf. also Remark 2.2),
As for the Bianchi equation one shows that (4.39) forms a regular symmetric hyperbolic system of evolution equations [supposing that there are no blow-ups in the denominator of (2.16)], for which standard well-posedness results are available, cf. Ref [27]. Equation (4.40) does not contain transverse derivatives and therefore provides a set of constraint equations.
C. Generalized Buchdahl condition
Let us devote attention to the issue whether the constraint equations (4.40) are preserved under evolution. The main aim of this section is to derive an analog of the Buchdahl condition (3.20).
Employing the algebraic Weyl symmetries of the fields involved as well as self-duality we find (the vacuum equations are not needed at this stage)
Here ∇ denotes the Levi-Civita connection associated with the Riemannian family t ↦ g_{ij}(t, x^{k}).
If we assume that the evolution equations
are fulfilled, we derive from that formula an equation which is satisfied by the constraint violation operator
We obtain
Before we proceed let us compare this with the Bianchi case where J(S) vanishes. Then the symmetric hyperbolic system
ensures that the constraints are preserved, i.e., zero data yield the zero-solution, if and only if
This recovers the Buchdahl condition (3.20) in self-dual language.
1. Divergence of J(𝒮)
In order to analyze the general case, we need to determine ∇^{μ}J(S){0iμ} in (4.43). This requires some computational effort. It is convenient to collect some relations needed for this computation first.
Any self-dual two form V_{αβ} satisfies
In any Λ-vacuum spacetime a self-dual Killing form fulfills the following relations [28]:
We need to determine the gradient of Q. For this recall the definition (2.10)–(2.12) of Q. In particular it implies
whence
Finally, using all these relations, we compute the divergence of J(S). A somewhat lengthy calculation reveals that
where the precise form of the generic tensor field f_{αβ}^{μνσρ}, which depends on the metric g, the Killing vector field X, and S_{αβμν} will be irrelevant for our purposes.
The right-hand side contains derivatives of S_{μνσρ}. We observe that they can be expressed as a linear combination of derivatives of the form X^{κ}∇_{κ}S_{αβμν} and ∇_{μ}S_{ρσαβ}. It follows from the algebraic symmetries of S_{μνσρ} that
Taking this into account we obtain
Rewriting yields after another tedious computation
For this step we used the following relation, which follows from the self-duality of the fields involved:
Altogether we have shown that (4.43) can be written as
Let us plug in the evolution equations ∇_{ρ}S_0(ij){ρ}=J(S){0(ij)},
Employing one more time the self-duality of the fields involved this can be written as
2. Generalized Buchdahl condition and its realization
We deduce from (4.54) that the analog of the Buchdahl condition for the MST equation (2.15), which is necessary for the preservation of the constraints under evolution, adopts the form
Since (4.54) is symmetric hyperbolic—its principal part has the same structure as the principal part of the system discussed in the specific case in Sec. VI E—the validity of the Buchdahl condition is also sufficient for the preservation of the constraints. Similar to how one proceeds to construct solutions to the Bianchi equation, let us assume that the MST of the background metric vanishes,
[It also follows from the considerations in Sec. IV A and the relevance of spacetimes with vanishing MST that this is a reasonable ansatz to realize (4.55).]
In contrast to the Bianchi equation, though, this is not sufficient to satisfy the generalized Buchdahl condition (4.55), whence we assume, in addition to (4.56), that
Recall that the Lie derivative of the MST always vanishes, L_{X}S_{αβμν}=0. Having the expectation in mind (cf. Remark 4.4) that a solution to the MST equation on a given background with vanishing MST can be interpreted as the linearized MST of some perturbed metric, (4.57) seems to be a very natural condition.
In contrast to (4.56), though, condition (4.57) involves the solution and not just the background spacetime. Fortunately, this spacetime condition can be realized by an appropriate choice of the initial data as will be discussed next.
Let us consider again (2.15). Note that it follows from (4.46) and (4.52) that
whence the Lie derivative with respect to the Killing vector X of the coefficients in (2.15) vanishes. That implies that once we have solved the evolution equations, the relation
holds automatically, i.e., the Lie derivative satisfies an identical system of equations. The condition (4.57) can therefore be realized by an appropriate choice of the initial data, namely,
Remark 4.6. In fact, in order to fulfill the Buchdahl condition it suffices if, in addition to (4.56), certain components of the Lie derivative vanish, namely,
holds. However, one would need to make sure that (4.61) follows from the evolution equations for appropriately chosen initial data sets, and it does not seem to be possible to derive a homogeneous system of equations for L_{X}(F^{μν}S_{αβμν}).Let us consider a Cauchy problem for (2.15) in a Λ-vacuum spacetime (M, g, X) with vanishing MST and which satisfies (2.14) (at least in some neighborhood of the Cauchy surface). Then the evolution equations (4.39) form a regular symmetric hyperbolic system for which well-posedness results are available.The Cauchy problem is therefore reduced to the issue to construct initial data sets which satisfy both the constraint equations and our requirement that the Lie derivative of S vanishes,
In this paper we are particularly interested in the construction solutions from a space-like I, so we will not attempt to solve this system here. Instead we will consider its analog on a space-like I in more detail, where it is in fact simpler since, e.g., (4.62) is always an inner equation on I (otherwise one would have to eliminate the transverse derivative via the evolution equations).
V. BIANCHI-LIKE EQUATION IN A CONFORMALLY RESCALED SPACETIME
A. Conformally rescaled spacetime
In view of Penrose’s notion of a smooth conformal structure at infinity, let us conformally rescale the spacetime (M, g),
In this “unphysical” spacetime, Einstein’s vacuum field equations are most conveniently replaced by Friedrich’s conformal field equations [17]. Since we will rarely need these equations, we will not discuss them here and refer to the literature. Nevertheless, two of these equations will be needed later: Set s̃≔14□_{g̃}Θ+124R̃Θ and denote by L̃{μν} the Schouten tensor of g̃. Then the following equations hold in any spacetime (M̃,g̃,Θ) which arises from a Λ-vacuum spacetime (M, g):
A Killing vector field X in (M, g) is mapped to a conformal Killing vector field X̃ in (M̃,g̃,Θ) (which we identify with X) which, in addition, satisfies [30]
Here and henceforth objects associated with the conformally rescaled metric g̃ will be decorated with a ^{̃}. The indices of those objects will be raised and lowered with g̃.
Due to the simple behavior of (2.15) under conformal rescalings of the metric, one easily shows [27] that in (M̃,g̃,Θ,X̃) the conformally rescaled MST
satisfies the equation
where the fields on the right-hand side need to be expressed in terms of the “unphysical” fields,
As in Sec. IV B we introduce Gaussian normal coordinates (near some Cauchy surface say) where
such that the system splits into a symmetric hyperbolic system of evolution equations ∇̃{ρ}T̃0(ij){ρ}=J(T̃){0(ij)} and a system of constraint equations ∇̃{ρ}T̃0i0{ρ}=J(T̃){0i0}.
B. Behavior of the MST equation near a space-like I
1. Expansions near I
Let us consider spacetimes which admit a smooth conformal completion at infinity à la Penrose [33,34]. By this it is meant that (M, g) admits a conformal rescaling (5.1) such that (M̃,g̃,Θ) admits a representation of null infinity
through which g̃ and Θ can be smoothly extended. I is a smooth hypersurface consisting of two subsets I^{−} and I^{+}, distinguished by the absence of endpoints of future and past causal curves in (M, g), respectively.
The causal character of I is determined by the sign of the cosmological constant [cf. (5.3)]. A positive cosmological constant
yields a space-like I. From now on we will assume that (5.13) holds. We further take I^{−} to be a connected component of past null infinity and restrict, if necessary, (M̃,g̃,Θ) to the domain of dependence of I^{−}. Our aim is to construct solutions to (5.6) by prescribing appropriate data on the Cauchy surface I^{−}.
In Ref [27] the leading order behavior of the coefficients in (5.6) at I^{−} has been computed, and it has been shown that it is actually a Fuchsian system. It is one of the main purposes of this work to analyze this system. It turns out that for this one needs to know the next-to-leading order terms, which have not been determined in Ref [27].
In Gaussian coordinates we have [as a consequence of (5.3)]
The gauge freedom which arises from the artificially introduced conformal factor Θ can be employed [16,31] to achieve that
Then we have by (5.2)
In particular,
In addition, there remains the gauge freedom to conformally rescale the initial 3-manifold which we shall employ later.
We denote the induced 3-metric on I^{−} by h, the volume form of h by ϵ_{ijk}, and its covariant derivative by D. It follows from (5.4) that the conformal Killing vector X̃ has no transverse component on I. It induces a conformal Killing vector on (I^{−},h) which we denote by Y. Moreover, let Y and N denote divergence and curl of Y,
In the gauge (5.11) and (5.15) we find the following expansions:
and [27]
Moreover, we have the useful relations,
2. Evolution equations and remaining gauge freedom
We analyze the behavior of the evolutionary part of the system (5.6) at I^{−}. In Gaussian coordinates it is given by the αβμ = 0(ij)-components. We denote by ∇̃ the Levi-Civita connection associated with the family t↦g̃{ij}(t,x^{k}) of conformally rescaled Riemannian metrics, and its volume form is denoted by ∇̃{ijk}.
For the left-hand side of (5.6) we find
while the right-hand side satisfies
Combined we end up with a symmetric hyperbolic system of the form (set E_{ij}≔T̃{0i0j} and observe that E_{ij} contains all independent components of the MST)
To simplify the analysis of (5.31) we exploit the above mentioned remaining gauge freedom, which is to conformally rescale the initial 3-manifold (I^{−},h).
We would like to achieve that the conformal Killing vector Y and its curl N are parallel, i.e., that the cross product vanishes,
For this purpose let us consider a conformal rescaling of the induced Riemannian metric h,
Then the following relations hold on the rescaled Riemannian manifold (I,h^) (we denote the associated Levi-Civita covariant derivative by D^):
Let us now make the gauge choice
Then, taking further into account that Y is a conformal Killing vector, (5.34)–(5.36) simply become
so in particular (5.32) holds.
We therefore can and will impose the gauge condition
for some real function λ = λ(x^{i}). In particular, Y is a proper Killing vector in this gauge. It simplifies the evaluation of (5.31) significantly which now reads [using also (5.17)]
3. Constraint equations
Next, we compute the asymptotic behavior of the constraint equations, i.e., of the αβμ = 0i0-components of (5.6) at I^{−}. In a gauge where (5.11) and (5.15) hold, we obtain for the right-hand side
where we have used the various expansions derived in Sec. V B 1. For the left-hand side of (5.6), we find
and combined, again with E_{ij}≡T̃{0i0j},
Imposing, in addition, the gauge condition (5.41), this becomes
We sum up the result of Sec. V B by the following:
Lemma 5.1. Let(M̃,g̃,Θ,X̃)be a solution to the conformal field equations with cosmological constant Λ > 0 which admits a conformal Killing vector fieldX̃which satisfies (5.4) and which admits a smoothIwhere|X̃|^{2}|_{I}>0. Assume further that the gauge conditions (5.11), (5.15), and (5.41) hold. Then the evolution and constraint part of (5.6) show a Fuchsian behavior nearIas given by (5.42) and (5.46), respectively.
Remark 5.1. The inequalities (2.14) hold near I as long as X̃ has no zeros on I. This follows from the expansions computed in Ref [27].
C. Admissible data sets on a space-like I
1. Preservation of the constraints from I
For the time being let us consider again the physical spacetime (M, g, X). Let us assume that S_{μνσρ} fulfills the evolution equations (4.39) and that (4.56) and (4.57) hold. Then (4.54) becomes
To transform this equation into the unphysical spacetime, note that the algebraic properties of S_{μνσρ} imply that
We further employ the relations (5.7)–(5.10) and (5.19)–(5.27) and take the behavior of the Levi-Civita connection under conformal transformations into account to obtain, in Gaussian normal coordinates (5.11), a homogeneous equations for Ξ̃{i},
2. Realization of the Buchdahl condition at I
We need to make sure that the generalized Buchdahl condition (4.55) holds, so let us translate it into the unphysical spacetime (M̃,g̃,Θ,X̃).
Under conformal rescaling we have (set F̃≔14∇̃{κ}X̃{κ})
as follows from (5.4). In the conformally rescaled spacetime, the Buchdahl condition (4.55) therefore adopts the form
where T̃{μνσρ} denotes the rescaled MST of the background spacetime (M̃,g̃,Θ,X̃).
We assume that the background spacetime (M̃,g̃,Θ,X̃) has a vanishing (rescaled) MST, and in order to make sure that (5.50) is fulfilled, we will further make sure that
The analog of (4.59) in the conformally rescaled spacetime reads
so (L_{X̃}+F̃)T̃{μνσρ} satisfies the same equation as T̃{μνσρ}.
Let us determine the expansion of (L_{X̃}+F̃)T̃{αβμν} near I. Assuming that the evolution equations hold, we find
In Gaussian normal coordinates, we have the expansions (5.19), (5.20), and
whence
In a gauge where (5.41) holds, this becomes
In Sec. VI E, it will be analyzed how initial data need to be chosen in order to satisfy the constraint equations and the Buchdahl condition, and for this Eqs. (5.48) and (5.52) will be relevant.
VI. FUCHSIAN ANALYSIS NEAR I^{−}
A. Preliminaries and the main result
For the purpose of this whole section, we shall introduce certain small variations of previous conventions and notations. Pick δ > 0 and an orientable 3-dimensional differentiable manifold Σ. We refer to M̃=(−δ,δ)×Σ as the conformal (or unphysical) spacetime and to M = (0, δ) × Σ as the physical spacetime; we always identify the physical spacetime with this subset of the conformal spacetime explicitly. As before, both manifolds are equipped with conformally related Lorentzian metrics; in this section, we only deal with the conformal (unphysical) metric g̃{μν} on M. Let t be the parameter on the (−δ, δ)-factor of M̃. We refer to the t = const-hypersurface for any t ∈ (−δ, δ) as Σ_{t}, i.e.,
which is clearly a subset of M̃ diffeomorphic to σ. We assume that all these hypersurfaces are space-like Cauchy surfaces of M̃. Notice that Σ_{0} agrees with I^{−}. We assume the existence of a conformal Killing vector field X̃{μ} of g̃{μν} on M̃.
Let Ñ{μ} be the future-pointing unit normal of the surfaces Σ_{t} in M̃ with respect to g̃{μν}. It will be convenient for the following discussion to adopt a slightly different index convention than before: Tensor indices μ, ν, … are still considered as abstract spacetime indices, while i, j, … shall now denote abstract indices which have been projected orthogonally into the hypersurfaces Σ_{t} with respect to Ñ{μ}. Correspondingly, the index 0 denotes projections onto Ñ{μ}. Interpreting all indices in this coordinate invariant manner has several advantages for the following discussion. It is only a slight shift of the view point and it is in full consistency with the conventions in Secs. I–V when tensors are expressed in terms of Gaussian coordinate frames. Most of the tensor fields we are dealing with in this section are completely intrinsic to Σ_{t}, i.e., fully spatial, and will henceforth carry indices i, j, … exclusively. A particular important example is the tensor E_{ij} derived from the MST.
The metric induced on Σ_{t} from the conformal metric g̃{μν} is therefore denoted by g̃{ij} (we shall sometimes write g̃{ij}(t) when the particular value of t is relevant or when we want to emphasize the fact that this metric is time dependent). On any Σ_{t}, this Riemannian metric g̃{ij} determines a volume form η̃{ijk} and a Levi-Civita covariant derivative ∇̃{k}. The consistent use of our abstract index conventions above makes it is unnecessary to introduce a special symbol for the Levi-Civita connection of the Riemannian metric g̃{ij}.
The metric induced on I^{−}=Σ_{0} will play a particular role in the following and is denoted by h_{ij}=g̃{ij}(0) as before. Via the Lie transport along Ñ{μ}, this metric h_{ij} can be dragged to any surface Σ_{t}; the resulting field on M̃ shall be referred to as h_{ij} as well for simplicity. We shall do the same for all quantities derived from h_{ij}, in particular, for the volume form ϵ_{ijk} and the covariant derivative D_{k} associated with h_{ij}. Since such fields are therefore by definition invariant under the Lie transport along Ñ{μ}, we say that they are time-independent. Any field on M̃ (or M) that is invariant in this way shall be referred to as time-independent; otherwise we call it time-dependent.
According to the discussion in Sec. V we shall now make certain assumptions about the behavior of various quantities at t = 0; recall that most of these conditions constitute no loss of generality because they can always be achieved by an appropriate choice of gauge. First we assume that
where, in this coordinate invariant sense, the O-symbol is defined with respect to any time-independent Riemannian reference metric uniformly on Σ in all of what follows. Second we assume that the conformal Killing vector field X̃{μ} can be written as
according to Eq. (5.19), where Y^{i} is a conformal Killing vector field of h_{ij} without zeros on Σ_{0}. We shall interpret Y^{i} as a time-independent field on M̃. In agreement with Eqs. (5.41) and (5.18) we also assume
where the quantity λ is some, in principle known, smooth time-independent function.
Following the earlier discussion, the MST is represented by a time-dependent purely spatial complex symmetric g̃{ij}-trace-free (0, 2)-tensor field E_{ij} as follows. According to Eq. (5.42), the MST evolution equations are
They are formally singular at t = 0 and hence only make sense for t > 0, i.e., on the subset M of M̃. Near t = 0, the smooth time-dependent field T^{kl}{ij} is given as
with
which is hence time-independent, and with some known smooth time-dependent field T^{kl}_{ij(1)}. According to Eq. (5.46), the constraint equations take the form
on M, where C̲{kl}{i} is some smooth time-dependent tensor field on M which is also known. All index operations in Eqs. (6.1)–(6.7) are performed with the metric h_{ij}.
Before we continue, a few remarks are in place. Recall that Eqs. (6.4)–(6.7) had been derived in Secs. IV and V assuming Gauss coordinates and further particular gauge choices. Once these equations have been derived, however, we can forget about this and consider them as fully invariant tensorial equations. Indeed, for large parts of the following analysis, we only need to impose Eqs. (6.1)–(6.3). Only for specific steps of our discussion, we explicitly need to introduce Gauss coordinates. One obtains a Gauss coordinate system within the general setup above by imposing the following restrictions on the foliation Σ_{t} with respect to the time function t. We pick spatial coordinates x^{i} on each leaf Σ_{t} and make the additional assumption that Ñ{μ}=∂tμ and Ñ{μ}=dt_{μ} for the corresponding spacetime coordinates (t, x^{i}).
The reader will notice that (6.6) looks significantly different from the corresponding terms in Eq. (5.42) (inside the second pair of brackets there). As one can easily check, however, both expressions are equivalent ifE_{ij} is symmetric and g̃{ij}-trace-free. Since in some of the intermediate steps of our arguments below we will allow E_{ij} to be non-symmetric and non-trace-free, the expression in Eq. (6.6) is more suitable than the one in Eq. (5.42). The field in Eq. (6.6) is by construction explicitly symmetric and h_{ij}-trace-free with respect to both pairs of indices. The field in Eq. (6.5) is identically symmetric and g̃{ij}-trace-free with respect to both pairs of indices.
The overall goal is to solve an initial value problem for Eq. (6.4) with data prescribed at t = 0 such that Eq. (6.7) is satisfied identically on M. As noticed before, Eq. (6.4) is formally singular at t = 0 and hence the initial value problem in the standard sense does not make sense. Instead we consider a singular initial value problem. The Fuchsian method shall allow us to prove the main result of this section, Theorem 6.1. Before we can state this theorem, however, we must introduce some further notation and terminology.
We say that an open subset Ω of M with compact closure in M̃ is a lens-shaped region (cf. Sec. 3.1 in Ref [18]) if its boundary is the union of two smooth space-like hypersurfaces in M̃ with respect to the conformal metric g̃{μν} and if the boundaries of these two hypersurfaces coincide and are smooth. When one of these two space-like hypersurfaces is called S in M̃, then we say that Ω is a lens-shaped region with respect to S. For any t ∈ (−δ, δ), we define Ω_{t} = Ω ∩ Σ_{t}; we allow Ω_{t} to be empty. We shall also write Ω_{(t0,t)} to denote the intersection of Ω with the spacetime slab (t_{0}, t) × Σ with 0 < t_{0} < t < δ.
In anticipation of the results in Sec. VI B, we define the following time-independent fields (index operations are performed with respect to h_{ij}):
where (e[1]i,e[2]i,Y^{i}) is any time-independent, Y^{i}-invariant h_{ij}-orthonormal frame.
Theorem 6.1 (Singular initial value problem of the MST equations). Pick δ > 0 and an orientable 3-dimensional differentiable manifold Σ. EquipM̃=(−δ,δ)×Σwith a smooth Lorentzian metricg̃{μν}with a conformal Killing vector fieldX̃{μ}without zeros onI^{−}=Σ_{0}and Gaussian coordinates (t, x^{i}) as before. Suppose that the MST of(M,g̃{μν},X̃{μ})vanishes and that Eqs. (6.1)–(6.3) hold with respect to our coordinate system. Pick any non-empty open subset S_{0}of Σ with compact closure and non-empty smooth boundary and any non-empty lens-shaped region Ω with respect to the subset {t = 0} × S_{0}of∂M⊂M̃, whereM=(0,δ)×Σ⊂M̃.Then, for any smooth complex time-independent functions c_{1}, c_{2}, and c_{3}on Ω with the property
where Y^{i}is defined byX̃{μ}through Eq. (6.2), there is a smooth solutionE_{ij}of Eqs. (6.4)–(6.7), i.e., of the full Mars-Simon equation (5.6), of the form
for every (t, x) ∈ Ω provided δ > 0 is sufficiently small. Here, E_{ij}is some smooth complex symmetricg̃{ij}-trace-free field which can be extended smoothly through t = 0 andlim_{t↘0}E_{ij}(t,x)=0for all points x. Any two smooth solutionsE_{ij}andẼ{ij}of this form given by the same data c_{1}, c_{2}, and c_{3}are identical on Ω.The remainder of this section is devoted to the proof of this theorem.
B. Spectral analysis of the principal part matrix
An essential first step in the proof of Theorem 6.1 is a detailed analysis of the field T^{kl}_{ij(0)} defined in Eq. (6.6). This will lead naturally to the quantities E_{ij(1)}, …, E_{ij(5)} above and to the structure of the leading-order term in Eq. (6.8).
The whole discussion in this subsection only involves time-independent fields. It can therefore be carried out on the abstract Cauchy surface Σ without any reference to time t. For this whole subsection, complex conjugates of complex fields are denoted with a bar. All index operations are performed with the metric h_{ij}. We pick an arbitrary point x ∈ Σ and refrain from writing x in the following formulas for simplicity. We consider the 9-dimensional complex vector space of (0, 2)-tensors of T_{x}Σ; we do not impose any symmetry or trace-free conditions at this stage yet. On this vector space we have an inner product
The quantity T_{ij}(0)kl defined in Eq. (6.6) can be considered as an endomorphism of this vector space which we find to be self-adjoint
It is thus diagonalizable, the eigenvalues are real and the respective eigenspaces are mutually orthogonal. Using any h_{ij}-orthonormal basis (e[1]i,e[2]i,Y^{i}) of T_{x}Σ [recall Eq. (6.3)] we can show
Eigenvalue −1: This eigenspace is spanned by the tensor
and is therefore a 1-dimensional subspace.
Eigenvalue 0: This eigenspace is spanned by all antisymmetric (0, 2)-tensors (3-dimensional), all pure h_{ij}-trace (0, 2)-tensors (1-dimensional) and all symmetric h_{ij}-trace-free (0, 2)-tensors e_{kl} with the property e_{kl}Y^{l} = 0 (2-dimensional). The latter subspace is spanned by
In total this eigenspace is therefore 6-dimensional.
Eigenvalue 3/4: This eigenspace is spanned by
and is therefore 2-dimensional.
Now, when we restrict the map T_{ij}(0)kl to the 5-dimensional subspace of symmetric, h_{ij}-trace-free (0, 2)-tensors, it is still a self-adjoint endomorphism and the analogue eigenspace decomposition can be carried out. The only difference is that the eigenspace of the eigenvalue 0 is now reduced to the two-dimensional subspace spanned by Eq. (6.11). The self-adjoint property implies that all eigenspaces are mutually orthogonal with respect to the scalar product Eq. (6.9). Thanks to the normalizations chosen above we find
The collection of fields E_{ij(1)} to E_{ij(5)} therefore constitutes an orthonormal basis of the complex vector space of symmetric h_{ij}-trace-free (0, 2)-tensors at x ∈ T_{x}Σ.
Since Theorem 6.1 only refers to open proper subsets S_{0} of Σ with compact closure, we can assume without loss of generality that Σ is a compact orientable 3-dimensional manifold and therefore parallelizable. We may therefore assume that (e[1]i,e[2]i,Y^{i}) is a global orthonormal frame on Σ and then construct E_{ij(1)} to E_{ij(5)} at each x ∈ Σ as above. In this way we may interpret these as smooth fields on Σ which satisfy all the properties above at each x ∈ Σ. We may even consider E_{ij(1)} to E_{ij(5)} as smooth time-independent fields on M̃ which satisfy all the properties above at each (t,x)∈M̃. Without loss of generality we can assume additionally that the orthonormal frame (e[1]i,e[2]i,Y^{i}) is invariant under the Lie transport along Y^{i} globally on Σ. This implies that
everywhere on M̃.
The remainder of this subsection is now devoted to some further technical properties of the fields E_{ij(p)} which turn out to be useful later. Given (6.10), the following quantity related to the curl of E_{jl(1)} can be written as
where we have used the second condition of Eq. (6.3). The third condition there implies that D_{k}Y_{j} is h_{ij}-trace-free. Since Y^{i} is a conformal Killing vector field of h_{ij}, it therefore follows that
We plug this into the expression above,
The first term is
Since this is symmetric in i and j, it follows
using Eq. (6.10).
Another useful identity can be derived for the divergence of E_{jl(1)}. Using again Eq. (6.10), we find
which follows from the third relation in Eq. (6.3). Equation (6.15) yields
Finally, we discuss the following:
using Eq. (6.10). If now we assume in addition to the above that the orthonormal frame (e[1]i,e[2]i,Y^{i}) is oriented according to ϵ_{kil}e[1]ke[2]iY^{l}=1, then Eqs. (6.10)–(6.12) imply
and
C. The singular initial value problem of the evolution equations
Next we are going to discuss the singular initial value problem of the evolution equations Eq. (6.4) with “data” prescribed at t = 0. This is an application of the Fuchsian method developed in Refs [2] and  [3] for general quasilinear symmetric hyperbolic systems. The main first step of the analysis of any singular initial value problem is to split the unknown into two parts. The first part is some explicitly known function—in most cases a generalized power series expansion about t = 0 some of whose coefficients constitute free data—which is supposed to describe the leading-order behavior of the unknown at the singular time t = 0. The second part, i.e., the difference of the original unknown and this leading-order term, is called the remainder. It is considered as the unknown of the singular initial value problem. The aim is then to show that given the leading-order term, there exists a remainder which is uniquely determined by the equation and which decays with some sufficiently high order at t = 0 relative to the leading-order term in some suitable sense. We remark that this decomposition also applies to the standard regular initial value problem. There the leading-order term corresponds to a (truncated) Taylor series of the solution about the initial time, and the free Cauchy data can be identified with some of its coefficients.
In the case of Eq. (6.4), the main tasks are therefore (i) to derive appropriate leading-order terms (see Sec. VI D) and (ii) to analyze the equation for the remainder. This subsection now is devoted to (ii). In a first step, we do not yet explicitly specify a leading-order term (and hence the free data). Instead we work with the following equation:
where the unknown is a complex time-dependent purely spatial (0, 2)-tensor field E_{ij}. The time-dependent source term field F̲{ij} is considered as given in most of the following discussion. It will eventually describe the contribution from the leading-order term of the singular initial value problem to the original equation (6.4), and the unknown E_{ij} will be identified with the remainder of the singular initial value problem; see the end of Sec. VI D. In this subsection, it is convenient to perform index operations with the metric g̃{ij}. Notice that the second term in Eq. (6.20) differs from the corresponding term in Eq. (6.4); however, both terms are the same in the eventual case of interest when E_{ij} is symmetric and g̃{ij}-trace-free. For the time being we allow F̲{ij} and E_{ij} to be any smooth time-dependent purely spatial (0, 2)-tensor fields. The purpose of the following now is to derive precise conditions on the source term field which guarantee the existence of a uniquely determined solution E_{ij} with a sufficient decay at t = 0.
Under all the conditions before, Eq. (6.20) is a linear symmetric hyperbolic system with smooth coefficients (the regularity of the source term field F̲{ij} has not been fixed yet). We shall therefore follow the analysis of this class of equations in Refs [2] and  [3]. Notice however that in contrast to these references, the spatial domain Σ here may not be a torus. In fact, the techniques presented below shall have a particular emphasis on localization and “domain of dependence” arguments; the torus will still play an intermediate role as we will see.
We derive now the fundamental energy estimates for solutions of Eq. (6.20). In contrast to the estimate in Refs [2] and  [3], we shall here take the tensorial character of the unknown E_{ij} explicitly into account and, in addition, localize the estimate. To this end, we suppose that the field F̲{ij} in Eq. (6.20) is defined on some open subset Ω of M (not necessarily a lens-shaped region) and is sufficiently smooth there (we specify the minimal regularity later). Suppose also that E_{ij} is a sufficiently smooth solution of Eq. (6.20) defined on Ω. We find
where, as before, complex conjugates are denoted with a bar. Hence, for any μ∈R, we have
The last two terms can be written as follows:
We have therefore found the following identity:
If δ > 0 is now sufficiently small, the linear map M^{kl}_{ij} on the complex vector space of (0, 2)-tensors at any given (t, x) ∈ Ω is positive definite with respect to the scalar product
provided the linear map
is positive definite at t = 0. Recall that index operations are performed with the metric g̃{ij} in this subsection and hence the inner product in (6.22) is distinct from the one in Eq. (6.9).
Using that g̃{ij} equals the metric h_{ij} at t = 0 according to Eq. (6.1), we conclude that the endomorphism M^{kl}_{ij(0)} is self-adjoint, and it is therefore positive definite at each (0, x) ∈ Σ_{0} provided that μ is strictly larger than the largest eigenvalue of the endomorphism T_{ij}^{kl}_{(0)}. According to the results in Sec. VI B, Eq. (6.21) therefore implies the inequality
for any (t, x) ∈ Ω provided that μ is any constant larger than 3/4 and δ is any sufficiently small positive constant.
Let us now, for the time being, pick Ω = M and Σ = T^{3}. Given this, let us, first, replace the spatial covariant derivative ∇̃{m} (defined with respect to g̃{ij}) by D_{m} (defined with respect to h_{ij}) in Eq. (6.21); this yields an additional (tensorial) contribution of O(t) to M^{kl}_{ij} in Eq. (6.21). For any sufficiently small δ > 0, this new map M^{kl}_{ij} is therefore positive definite under the same conditions as above. Second, noting that ∇̃{0} acts on a scalar function in Eq. (6.21), it can therefore be interpreted as the directional derivative along directional derivative along Ñ{μ}. When we now introduce arbitrary coordinates (t, x^{i}) on M̃, for example (but not necessarily), Gauss coordinates, for the same time function t as above and hence obtain that Ñ{μ}=α∂tμ+β^{μ} for a strictly positive function α and a purely spatial vector field β^{i}, the spatial derivative associated with the β^{i}-term yields an additional contribution to the last and to the first term on the right side of Eq. (6.21). The contribution to the first term is O(t) and does therefore not change the positivity criterion of the new map M^{kl}_{ij}. Third, we integrate over the spatial domain Σ_{t} = T^{3} with respect to the volume element of h_{ij} at any t ∈ (0, δ). The last term in Eq. (6.21) (including the additional contribution obtained in the second step above) then disappears as a consequence of Stokes’ theorem. If (eai) (a, b, … = 1, 2, 3) is any smooth g̃{ij}-orthonormal frame intrinsic to each surface Σ_{t} (for example, consider the frame in Sec. VI B) and we denote by E(t, x) the 9-dimensional complex vector of frame components of E_{ij}(t, x) and by F̲(t,x) the corresponding vector for F̲{ij}(t,x), then
for some uniform constant C > 0 (determined by the function α above). In this notation, the metric h_{ij} determines the volume element with respect to which the norm and scalar product are defined. An application of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and integration with respect to t over any interval (t_{0}, t) with 0 < t_{0} < t < δ yield
See Sec. 7.2 in Ref [36] for some of the basic technical steps going from (6.25) and (6.26). By adapting the constant C we can conclude that
for any t_{0} > 0 and t∈t_{0},δ. These norms are now defined with respect to the Euclidean flat metric on T^{3}. Thanks to this estimate, we are now in the position to apply the methods in Refs [2] and  [3] (see Propositions 2.10 and 2.12 in Ref [2] and Proposition 3.5 in Ref [3]) to establish the following fundamental existence result.
Proposition 6.2 (T^{3}-existence and uniqueness: Evolution equations). Pick any sufficiently small δ > 0, any integer q > 3/2 + 1 and set Σ = T^{3}. EquipM̃=(−δ,δ)×Σwith a smooth Lorentzian metricg̃{μν}with a conformal Killing vector fieldX̃{μ}without zeros onI^{−}=Σ_{0}. Suppose that Eqs. (6.1)–(6.3) hold. Consider any complex fieldF̲{ij}on M = (0, δ) × Σ whose orthonormal frame componentsF̲{ab}are in X_{δ,ν,q}(T^{3}) for some constant ν > 3/4. Then Eq. (6.20) has a classical solution E_{ij}defined on M whose orthonormal frame components E_{ab}are in X_{δ,μ,q}(T^{3}) for any constant μ < ν. Moreover, all functionstÑ(E_{ab})are in X_{δ,μ,q−1}for the same μ. This solution E_{ij}is uniquely determined within the class of all fieldsẼ_{ij}defined on M whose orthonormal frame componentsẼ_{ab}are continuously differentiable and which satisfy
for some constant η > 3/4.The Banach spaces X_{δ,μ,q}(T^{3}) are defined [2,3] as the completion of the set of smooth functions f on (0, δ) × T^{3} with respect to the norm
where H^{q}(T^{3}) is the standard L^{2}-Sobolev space on T^{3} (with respect to the flat metric) of differentiability order q. Notice that in general the exponent μ is allowed to be any smooth function on T^{3}; for the purpose of our studies here it is sufficient to work with constant exponents μ exclusively. The interested reader can find the details in the references above and in Refs [4] and  [10].Proposition 6.2 is our fundamental existence and uniqueness result. However, several of its aspects are not fully satisfying. The first issue we address now is the restriction Σ = T^{3}. We thereby obtain a localized existence and uniqueness result.To this end, we shall first determine the characteristics of the hyperbolic system Eq. (6.20). The characteristic surfaces are expected to bound the domain of dependence of solutions of the singular initial value problem. By definition, the normal to any characteristic surface at (t, x) in M is a spacetime covector (ξ_{0}, ξ_{m}) for which the determinant of the principal symbol of Eq. (6.20)
vanishes; this is interpreted as an endomorphism on the complex vector space of (0, 2)-tensors at (t, x). For any choice of spatial covector ξ_{m}, this is the case if and only if ξ_{0} is an eigenvalue of the linear map
By straightforward calculations we show that this map is diagonalizable on our 9-dimensional complex vector space. The eigenspace of the eigenvalue 0 is 5-dimensional, and the eigenspace of each of the four eigenvalues ±|ξ|/2 and ±|ξ| is 1-dimensional where |ξ|=(g̃ijξiξj){1/2}. Solutions to Eq. (6.20) therefore propagate at either speed 0, half of the speed of light, or the full speed of light.Consider now any non-empty open subset S_{0} of Σ_{0} with compact closure and smooth non-empty boundary and pick a lens-shaped region Ω with respect to S_{0}. Suppose first now that F̲{ij} vanishes identically on Ω and that E_{ij} is a solution of Eq. (6.20) defined on Ω whose orthonormal frame components (chosen as in Proposition 6.2) are C^{1}-functions on Ω and, for any t and t_{0} with 0 < t_{0} < t < δ, extend as C^{1}-functions to the boundary of Ω_{(t0,t)}. Integrating (6.24) over Ω_{(t0,t)} with respect to the volume element of the metric g̃{μν} assuming μ > 3/4 and applying Stokes’ theorem, we get
Recall here that the boundary of the lens-shaped region is space-like everywhere and hence all remaining boundary integrals implied by Stokes’ theorem have a “good” sign thanks to the properties of the characteristics established above. If now we assume that
and we take the limit t_{0} ↘ 0 in Eq. (6.28), we conclude that E_{ij}(t, x) = 0 for all (t, x) ∈ Ω. Because g̃{ij} is a smooth Riemannian metric near t = 0, this is the case if and only if
where dx denotes the flat volume element. This completes the proof of the following lemma.
Lemma 6.3. Pick any sufficiently small δ > 0 and orientable 3-dimensional differentiable manifold Σ. EquipM̃=(−δ,δ)×Σwith a smooth Lorentzian metricg̃{μν}with a conformal Killing vector fieldX̃{μ}without zeros onI^{−}=Σ_{0}. Suppose that Eqs. (6.1)–(6.3) hold. Pick any non-empty open subset S_{0}of Σ with compact closure and non-empty smooth boundary and any lens-shaped region Ω with respect to the subset {t = 0} × S_{0}of∂M⊂M̃, whereM=(0,δ)×Σ⊂M̃. Suppose thatF̲{ij}vanishes identically on Ω and that E_{ij}is a solution of Eq. (6.20) defined on Ω whose orthonormal frame components are C^{1}-functions on Ω and, for any t and t_{0}with 0 < t_{0} < t < δ, extend as C^{1}-functions to the boundary ofΩ_{(t0,t)}. If in addition
for some μ > 3/4, then E_{ij}(t, x) = 0 for all (t, x) ∈ Ω.Due to the linearity of the equations, this lemma yields conditions under which the values of the solution E_{ij} on Ω are guaranteed to be independent of the values of the source term F̲{ij} outside of Ω.We remark that this local uniqueness statement here is more general than Lemma 4.14 in Ref [27] because only the class of solutions of the MST evolution equations which extend as C^{1}-functions through t = 0 is considered there. We will see below that the evolution equations admit solutions which violate this property. Only towards the end of this whole section we will see how to restrict the class of solutions appropriately in order to establish smoothness through t = 0; see Sec. VI F.In consistency with the localized character of Theorem 6.1 (and therefore Lemma 6.3), we shall henceforth ignore the dynamics outside of Ω now. In particular, since Ω is a proper subset of M, it is no loss of generality to pick Σ = T^{3} as in Proposition 6.2 now in all of what follows. Suppose that F̲{ij} is any smooth field on Ω which can be extended smoothly to M = (0, δ) × T^{3} such that the vector of its frame components satisfies
for some ν > 3/4 and for all positive integers q. This is equivalent to the condition that this extended field is in X_{δ,ν,q}(T^{3}) for some ν > 3/4 for all positive integers q. Proposition 6.2 therefore implies the existence of a classical (in fact smooth) solution E_{ij} on M. Since the vector E of its orthonormal frame components is in X_{δ,μ,q} for any μ < ν, it is therefore possible to satisfy Eq. (6.29) for some μ ∈ (3/4, ν). Lemma 6.3 thus implies that the restriction of E_{ij} to Ω is unaffected by the extension of F̲{ij} to M = (0, δ) × T^{3}.
Proposition 6.4 (Local existence and uniqueness: Evolution equations). Pick any sufficiently small δ > 0 and orientable 3-dimensional differentiable manifold Σ. EquipM̃=(−δ,δ)×Σwith a smooth Lorentzian metricg̃{μν}with a conformal Killing vector fieldX̃{μ}without zeros onI^{−}=Σ_{0}. Suppose that Eqs. (6.1)–(6.3) hold. Pick any non-empty open subset S_{0}of Σ with compact closure and non-empty smooth boundary and any lens-shaped region Ω with respect to the subset {t = 0} × S_{0}of∂M⊂M̃, whereM=(0,δ)×Σ⊂M̃. Consider any smooth complex fieldF̲{ij}on Ω which can be extended smoothly to (0, δ) × T^{3} (considering S_{0}as a subset of T^{3}) such that the orthonormal frame components of the extended field are in X_{δ,ν,q}(T^{3}) for some constant ν > 3/4 and every positive integer q. Then Eq. (6.20) has a smooth solution E_{ij}defined on Ω that satisfies
for any μ < ν. The same estimate holds for any spatial derivative of any order of the frame components of E_{ij}. If there is any other solutionẼ_{ij}on Ω whose orthonormal frame components are C^{1}-functions on Ω and, for any t and t_{0}with 0 < t_{0} < t < δ, extend as C^{1}-functions to the boundary ofΩ_{(t0,t)}and has the property
for some μ > 3/4, then
for every (t, x) ∈ Ω.The following is a direct consequence of the symmetry and trace-free-ness of all terms in Eqs. (6.4) and (6.5).
Corollary 6.5. In addition to the hypothesis of Proposition 6.4, suppose that the fieldF̲{ij}isg̃{ij}-traceless and symmetric on Ω. Then the solution E_{ij}asserted by Proposition 6.4 isg̃{ij}-traceless and symmetric.More specifically, this corollary is proved by first decomposing the unknown into its symmetric trace-free part, its antisymmetric part, and its pure trace part. Due to the symmetry and trace-free-ness of all terms in the equations, the first part can be handled as above, while the equations for the second and third parts become trivial. All solutions compatible with condition (6.30) therefore have vanishing antisymmetric and pure trace parts.
D. The leading-order term
According to Sec. VI B there are real time-independent symmetric, h_{ij}-trace-free purely spatial tensor fields E_{ij(1)}, …, E_{ij(5)} which form an orthonormal basis of the complex vector space of symmetric and h_{ij}-trace-free purely spatial tensors at any (t, x) in M̃. Any complex symmetric g̃{ij}-trace-free (0, 2)-tensor field [in particular the unknown of (6.4)] can therefore be expanded in M as follows:
for complex functions f_{1}, …, f_{5} (whose regularity shall be specified later). The O(t^{2})-correction is necessary here because the fields E_{ij(p)} are h_{ij}- and therefore not g̃{ij}-trace-free.
Now we assume Gaussian coordinates (t, x^{i}) where t is the time function introduced earlier. Hence Ñ{μ}=∂tμ. We plug (6.31) into (6.4) with (6.5), noticing that due to Eqs. (5.11) and (6.1) the additional terms picked up when ∇̃{0} is expressed in terms of ∂tμ contribute smoothly to the last term of (6.5) only. Then the properties of the fields E_{ij(p)} established before imply the system (index operations are performed with the metric h_{ij} for this whole subsection)
for smooth, in principle known functions Tqp(t,x) defined for all p, q = 1, …, 5. The aim is now to derive expansions of the solutions of this system which shall determine the leading-order term of our singular initial value problem eventually.
It is ok to use slightly loose and imprecise language in a first step now because we will eventually justify the resulting expressions fully rigorously. With this in mind we suppose now that f_{1} = O(t^{−1}) and f_{2}, f_{3}, f_{4}, f_{5} = O(1) at t = 0, possibly, with additional log t factors which we control formally by incorporating an arbitrarily small positive constant η > 0 into the following arguments. Under this assumption, Eq. (6.32) can be simplified as follows:
where we recall that ϵ_{ijk} and D_{k} are the volume form and covariant derivative associated with h_{ij}. The family of functions
given by an arbitrary (time independent) complex function c_{1} satisfies this equation, i.e., it represents the leading terms of a formal expansion of Eq. (6.32). Given this, (6.33) and (6.34) become (we refrain from writing the arguments x and t now)
for which we find
for arbitrary complex functions c_{2}(x) and c_{3}(x). Finally, (6.35) and (6.36) are written as
which leads to
for arbitrary complex functions c_{4}(x) and c_{5}(x).
These formal leading-order expressions for the functions f_{1}, …, f_{5} can be simplified significantly using
which holds for every p = 1, …, 5 as a consequence of Eqs. (6.16) and (6.13) and using Eq. (6.18). Observe in particular that the logarithmic terms drop out thanks to Eq. (6.18). Given all this and Eq. (6.31), we set
which is determined by arbitrary time-independent complex functions c_{1}, …, c_{5}. Anticipating the following results we shall refer to this field as the leading-order term of our singular initial value problem and the functions c_{1}, …, c_{5} as the (singular) data.
Let us now assume as in Proposition 6.4 that Σ is any 3-dimensional orientable manifold, δ > 0 is sufficiently small, S_{0} is a non-empty open subset of Σ_{0} with compact closure and smooth non-empty boundary, and Ω is a lens-shaped region with respect to S_{0}. Let us further suppose that c_{1}, …, c_{5} are smooth complex functions on S_{0}. Since Ω is a proper subset of M, we can assume without loss of generality that Σ = T^{3} and that c_{1}, …, c_{5} have been extended as smooth functions to T^{3} (where as before we consider S_{0} as a subset of T^{3}). The field E_{ij,*} defined in Eq. (6.38) can then be interpreted as a smooth field for all (t, x) ∈ (0, δ) × T^{3}. When we now write E_{ij}=E_{ij,*}+E_{ij} and plug this into Eq. (6.4), we obtain Eq. (6.20) with
which is therefore also a smooth field on (0, δ] × T^{3}. We check easily that the frame components satisfy
The following proposition is then a consequence of Proposition 6.4 and Corollary 6.5.
Proposition 6.6. Consider the hypothesis of Proposition 6.4, introduce Gauss coordinations, and letF̲{ij}be given by Eqs. (6.38) and (6.39) on Ω for arbitrary smooth time-independent complex functions c_{1}, …, c_{5}. The solution E_{ij}asserted by Proposition 6.4 for ν = 1 gives rise to a smooth solutionE_{ij}=E_{ij,*}+E_{ij}of the Mars-Simon evolution equations (6.4) on Ω. In particular, the fieldE_{ij}is symmetric andg̃{ij}-trace-free.
E. The constraints
We have now constructed smooth solutions E_{ij} of the singular initial value problem of the evolution equations (6.4) on certain subsets Ω of M. Through the relation E_{ij}=T̃{0i0j}, this determines the field T̃{μνσρ} on Ω which is supposed to be a MST. The next question we need to address is whether, given any such solution, the constraint violation quantities Ξ̃{i} [see Eq. (6.7)] vanish identically on Ω. Only if this is the case, this field T̃{μνσρ} is a solution of the full Mars-Simon equations (5.6) on Ω and therefore a MST.
First we need to make sure that the Buchdahl condition, see Secs. IV C 2 and V C 2, holds. To this end, we shall now assume that the background spacetime has a vanishing MST. The Buchdahl condition then reduces to Eq. (5.51). This means that we shall from now on only accept those solutions asserted by Proposition 6.6 for which the associated tensor field r_{μνσρ}=(L_{X̃}+F̃)T̃{μνσρ} vanishes identically on Ω. According to the discussion in Sec. V C 2, this tensor field satisfies the same evolution equations as T̃{μνσρ} and has the same algebraic properties as T̃{μνσρ}. When Lemma 6.3 is applied to the tensor field r̃{ij}=r_{0i0j} instead of E_{ij}, it follows that r̃{ij}, and thereby r_{μνσρ}, vanish identically on Ω if the vector r̃ of its orthonormal frame components satisfies
for some μ > 3/4. We conclude from Eqs. (5.54), (5.53), and (5.41) that this is the case if the orthonormal frame components of L_{Y}E_{ij} vanish in this same sense in the limit t ↘ 0. Because of Eq. (6.14), this is the case for the class of solutions given by Proposition 6.6, if the Lie derivatives of the data c_{1}, …, c_{5} with respect to Y^{i} vanish.
Lemma 6.7. Consider the hypothesis of Proposition 6.6. Suppose in addition that the MST of the background spacetime vanishes identically on Ω and that
Then the solutionE_{ij}asserted by Proposition 6.6 of the evolution equations (6.4) satisfies the Buchdahl condition Eq. (5.50) on Ω.Recall Sec. IV C where we established the constraint propagation system and discussed the role of the Buchdahl condition. Close to t = 0, this system takes the form
where index operations are performed with the metric g̃{ij}.Let us now make the same assumptions as in Lemma 6.7 where E_{ij}=E_{ij,*}+E_{ij} is the smooth solution asserted by Proposition 6.6. The fields Ξ̃{i} are determined by Eq. (6.7) from E_{ij}, which are therefore also smooth fields on Ω. With similar arguments as in Sec. VI C, we establish from Eq. (6.41) that
By choosing a time-dependent orthonormal frame with respect to g̃{ij} which is smooth through t = 0 and which has the property that one of the frame vector fields agrees with Y^{i} at t = 0, we see that the map (1 + 4μ)δ_{i}^{k} + 13Y_{i}Y^{k} on the complex vector space of (0, 1)-tensors at any (t, x) in Ω is positive definite if μ > −1/4. Similar to our discussion in Sec. VI C, we then perform an integration over any spacetime slab Ω_{(t0,t)}⊂M with 0 < t_{0} ≤ t < δ with respect to the spacetime metric g̃{μν}. As a consequence of a characteristic analysis of Eq. (6.41), which establishes that all characteristic eigenvalues are 0 or ±|ξ|/2, all additional boundary terms which arise from the application of Stokes’ theorem over the lens-shaped region have a “good” sign if δ > 0 is sufficiently small. We conclude that the constraint violation quantities Ξ̃{i} vanish identically on Ω provided lim_{t↘0}‖t^{−μ}Ξ̃(t,⋅)‖{L^{2}(Ωt)}=0 for some μ > −1/4 where Ξ̃ is the vector of orthonormal frame components.When we now calculate the fields Ξ̃{i} using Eqs. (6.7) for any solution E_{ij}=E_{ij,*}+E_{ij} asserted by Proposition 6.6 with the additional hypothesis of Lemma 6.7, we find that lim_{t↘0}‖t^{−μ}Ξ̃(t,⋅)‖{L^{2}(Ωt)}=0 for some μ > −1 provided
This is therefore always the case under the hypothesis of Lemma 6.7. Using Eq. (6.19) we then show that lim_{t↘0}‖t^{−μ}Ξ̃(t,⋅)‖{L^{2}(Ωt)}=0 for some μ > −1/4 provided
We have therefore established the following result.
Proposition 6.8. Consider the hypothesis of Proposition 6.6. Suppose in addition that the MST of the background spacetime vanishes identically on Ω and that
Then the solutionE_{ij}asserted by Proposition 6.6 of the evolution equations (6.4) on Ω is a solution of the full Mars-Simon equations on Ω.
F. Smooth extendibility through I^{−}
Any of the solutions of the Mars-Simon equations constructed in Proposition 6.8 is smooth on the lens-shaped region Ω. If the datum c_{1} does not vanish, however, it is singular in the limit t ↘ 0. In fact, it has been observed in Ref [27] that such a divergent behavior of the rescaled Mars-Simon tensor at I^{−} needs to be expected and is in fact generic (unless certain components of the radiations field and the Cotton-York tensor of the induced metric on I^{−} vanish). We now finally wish to show that if we subtract the leading singular term c_{1}t^{−1}E_{kl(1)} from the solution E_{ij}, see Eq. (6.38), the resulting field extends smoothly through t = 0. Observe that the t^{3/4}-terms in Eq. (6.38) are not present as a consequence of the hypothesis of Proposition 6.8.
In fact, we attempt to show now that the remainder field E_{ij} can be written as a truncated Taylor series of arbitrary order L > 0 for all (t, x) ∈ Ω, i.e.,
for some new remainder Ẽ_{ij}(t, x) with the property that lim_{t↘0}‖t^{−μ}Ẽ(t,⋅)‖{H^{q}(Ωt)}=0 for any μ < L + 1 and any positive integer q, formed from the orthonormal frame components of Ẽ_{ij}.
To this end let us consider any solution E_{ij} asserted by Proposition 6.6 under the additional conditions of Proposition 6.8. Then set E_{ij}(t,x)=E_{ij}−E_{ij,*}. Recall that E_{ij}(t, x) satisfies Eq. (6.20) with F̲{ij} given by Eq. (6.39). Plugging Eq. (6.42) into (6.20), we find that Ẽ_{ij} satisfies the same equation (6.20), just with a different source term
We know that F̲{ij} is a smooth field through t = 0 and that it can hence be written as
for some smooth fields F̲{ij,ℓ}(x) and F̲̃{ij}(t,x) through t = 0. According to Eq. (6.5) we can also write
for another smooth field T̃{kl}{ij}(t,x) through t = 0. All this yields that
Hence, lim_{t↘0}‖t^{−ν}F^(t,⋅)‖{H^{q}(Ωt)}=0 for ν = L + 1 and all q, formed from the frame components of F̲^{ij}—and hence Proposition 6.4 applied to the equation for Ẽ_{ij} discussed above establishes that the uniquely determined solution Ẽ_{ij} on Ω has the required properties—provided the following finite hierarchy of linear algebraic equations has a solution:
for all ℓ = 2, …, L. Indeed it does. The first equation has a unique solution E_{kl,1} since 1 is not an eigenvalue of T^{kl}_{ij(0)}; see Sec. VI B. Given this solution E_{kl,1}, the second equation for ℓ = 2 has a unique solution E_{kl,2} since 2 is not an eigenvalue of T^{kl}_{ij(0)}. If ℓ is any integer 2 …, L, given any solution E_{kl,ℓ−1}, the second equation for ℓ has a unique solution E_{kl,ℓ} since ℓ is not an eigenvalue of T^{kl}_{ij(0)}.
We have therefore now fully established Theorem 6.1.
