Application of renormalization group analysis to two-phase turbulent flows with solid dust particles
Renormalization group methods are used to develop a macroscopic turbulence model for incompressible two phase turbulent flows. The velocity field is divided into slow (large-scale) and fast (small-scale) modes. With the help of the renormalization procedure, momentum equations for the large-scale modes and expressions for effective turbulent viscosity were obtained. These expressions reveal that the presence of the second phase causes decreased turbulent viscosity.
I. INTRODUCTION
The present paper focuses on the further development of the renormalization group (RNG) theory, which has been widely used to produce turbulence models for pure one-phase fluids as applied to porous media. The definition of a renormalization group includes a set of symmetry transformations which operate on a space of parameters. The RNG theory has been initially developed for quantum field research and served as a standard method that helps eliminating singularities ( [Gell-Mann and Low, 1954]). Afterwards the RNG theory was used by  [Wilson (1971)] to study critical phenomena.
Renormalized perturbation methods were employed by  [Kraichnan (1959)] for theoretical studies of turbulence phenomena. As a result,  [Kraichnan (1959)] proposed a theory of direct interaction approximation. The RNG theory was applied by  [Forster et_al (1977)] for an investigation into turbulence problems. This work further developed the RNG theory for power-law forcing for situations where the small scales affect the large scales like eddy viscosity. The RNG model was also utilized by  [De Dominicis and Martin (1979)] for turbulence studies, which, however, involved the field formulation.  [Fournier and Frisch (1983)] demonstrated the possibility of using the RNG model to obtained amplitude coefficients, being in fact universal constants independent of the parameters of the system in the small scale area, for instance, of the molecular viscosity.
 [Yakhot and Orszag (1986)] employed the RNG theory to develop a closed model of turbulence. Based on the findings of  [Forster et_al (1977)], they proposed a model for large scales, whereas the effect of small scales was described by a modified transport coefficient. The equations for the large scales were derived via averaging over an infinitesimal range of small scales. Having done this, the small scales were excluded from the further consideration. The process of exclusion was performed iteratively and entailed obtaining a differential equation for effective transport coefficients. After the exclusion of small scales, the equation for large scales preserved its form unchanged. Based on the RNG theory,  [Yakhot and Orszag (1986)] derived relations for turbulent viscosity, equations for a passive scalar, the turbulent Prandtl number, the Batchelor constant, turbulence kinetic energy, and the dissipation rate. A discussion of the theory proposed  [Yakhot and Orszag (1986)] can be found in the work of  [Kraichnan (1987)].  [Smith and Reynolds (1992)] verified independently the theory of  [Yakhot and Orszag (1986)] and, as a result, improved and refined the derived relations for the skewness and the dissipation rate. In addition to the main model,  [Yakhot and Orszag (1986)] developed also an RNG subgrid scale turbulence model for large-eddy simulation. With the help of the RNG theory, an additional term in the equation for the dissipation rate was derived by  [Yakhot et_al (1992)], which plays an important role for flows with anisotropic turbulence. The RNG theory was further involved in the in-depth studies of turbulence by  [Rubinstein and Barton (1990)],  [Speziale et_al (1991)],  [Yakhot and Smith (1992)], and  [Eyink] ( [1993; 1994]).
 [Avramenko and Kuznetsov (2006)] used renormalization group theory to develop a macroscopic (large-scale) turbulence model for an incompressible flow in porous media. The model takes into consideration the large-distance and large-time performance of velocity correlations arising in the momentum equation for a randomly stirred and incompressible flow. The renormalization methodology enabled deriving the transport equations for the large-scale modes and relations for effective transport coefficients. In addition,  [Avramenko and Kuznetsov (2006)] derived relations for the renormalized turbulent viscosity with allowance for the ultraviolet subrange of the turbulent kinetic energy spectrum.
Mathematical modeling of the three-dimensional two-phase (dusty) Couette flow and heat transfer between two infinite horizontal parallel porous flat plates has been performed by  [Gireesha et_al (2012)]. The mathematical formulation included a continuum two-phase model based on the earlier work of  [Saffman (1962)]. Authors managed to solve the resulting equations analytically. Analytical relations for the velocity and temperature profiles of both phases (fluid and dust) were derived by way of solving the governing partial differential equations with the help of a perturbation method.
An important example of two-phase turbulent flows, where the main and the second phase are liquid, is the Toms effect, that is, drag reduction of the turbulent flow in the presence of polymer additives; see  [Toms (1948)]. A review of the state-of-the-art elucidating open questions and suggestion of a general conceptual framework is documented in the review paper of  [Graham (2004)].  [Elyukhina and Khomyakov (2013)] experimentally investigated injection of different polymer solutions into the boundary layer around vehicle models to study drag reduction, which in particular cases amounted up to 30%.  [Zhao et_al (2010)] made very detailed experimental contribution to studies of the Toms effect in microchannels related biological applications. A low-Reynolds-number k-ε turbulence model (that is in fact a semi-empirical model) accounting for the Toms effect in non-Newtonian fluids was recently proposed by  [Tsukahara and Kawaguchi (2013)]. Evolution of fluid structures and drag reduction in polymer drag-reduced turbulent channel flows was theoretically studied by  [Kim and Sureshkumar (2013)].  [Gillissen (2008)] has undertaken direct numerical simulations of turbulent drag reduction in a channel flow of solutions of rigid and flexible polymers.  [L’vov et_al (2005)] focused on a theoretical study of the structure of the elastic stress tensor proportional to the polymer conformation tensor. It was shown in the work that the influence of the polymers on the energy and momentum balance can be accurately predicted by the effective polymer viscosity.
Another eloquent example of turbulent two-phase flows is provided by nanofluid flows.  [Avramenko et_al (2012)] studied heat, momentum, and mass transfer in a turbulent boundary layer flow of a nanofluid over a flat plate were. Boundary layer equations transformed to a self-similar form using the Lie group technique based on the symmetry properties of these equations, which were afterwards solved numerically. As a first approximation, turbulent viscosity was predicted using the mixing-length in line with the methodology (the Lie group technique plus the mixing-length model) developed first by  [Avramenko et_al (2001)]. The model of  [Avramenko et_al (2012)] took into account dependences of physical properties (viscosity, thermal conductivity, and diffusion coefficients) on the nanofluid concentration and temperature.
Basically, most of the authors in their numerical simulations of two-phase flows used semi-empirical turbulence models developed and validated for one-phase flows; see, e.g.,  [Yousefi-Lafouraki et_al (2016)] and  [Greifzu et_al (2016)]. On the other hand, as mentioned above, for the flows subject to noticeable Toms effect,  [Tsukahara and Kawaguchi (2013)] developed a low-Reynolds-number k-ε turbulence model for non-Newtonian fluids specially modified to account for effects of the second phase, which made simulations of these authors more closely agreeing with experimental data.
The main objective of the present analysis is to develop a theoretical model for turbulent viscosity which takes into account the effect of solid particles. To derive an analytical solution for turbulent viscosity, the RNG technique will be employed. The model will take into consideration the large-distance and large-time behavior of velocity correlations generated by the momentum equation for randomly stirred incompressible flows. The renormalization procedure will help to obtain momentum equations for the large-scale modes and relations for turbulent viscosity. These relations are expected to exhibit and quantify the effect of the second phase on the damping of turbulence. The model to be used does not account for the nanoeffects; therefore, its applicability for nanofluids should be studied separately in the future.
II. BASIC EQUATIONS
We will consider here a three-dimensional unsteady incompressible turbulent flow with a pressure gradient. The flow is two-phase consisting of gas and dust particles. We will follow the simplifying assumptions about the motion of the dust particles accepted by  [Saffman (1962)]. The dust particles in our model are uniform in size and shape. The bulk (or volume) concentration of the dust is very small; therefore the net effect of the dust on the fluid flow is equivalent to an extra force per unit volume. The Reynolds number of the relative motion between the dust and fluid is small as compared to unity; therefore the force between the dust and fluid is proportional to the relative velocity. Expanding the mathematical problem statement of  [Saffman (1962)] and  [Gireesha et_al (2012)] to include the term for the random force, one can write the momentum equation as
where f_{n} is an external random force, which is assumed to be Gaussian, solenoidal ( [Yakhot and Orszag, 1986]), isotropic in space, and homogeneous white noise in time; p is the pressure; t is the time; u_{n} are projections of the velocity vector of the fluid on the orthogonal coordinate axes x_{n}; υ_{n} are projections of the velocity vector of a particle on the orthogonal coordinate axes x_{n}; x_{n} are the orthogonal coordinates; ν_{0} is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid (the subscript “0” means that the renormalization process will begin from this value); ρ is the density of the fluid,
N_{0} is the number density of the dust particles (i.e., the number of particles per unit volume), which is assumed to be constant; m is the mass of the dust particles (i.e., one particle); t_{p} is the relaxation time of the particle phase, which stands for the time taken for the dust particles to adjust to the fluid velocity.
III. FOURIER DECOMPOSITION OF THE BASIC EQUATIONS
The subsequent analysis will be performed in the Fourier space. The Fourier transformation of the velocity, pressure, random force, temperature fields, and direction cosines is performed as follows:
where U_{n}, P, Wnmf, Wnmp, and F_{n} are the Fourier transforms of u_{n}, p, u_{n}u_{m}, υ_{n}υ_{m}, and f_{n}, respectively; κ is a wavenumber (a component of the vector κ); κ is the d-dimensional wavevector; ω is the frequency; x is the d-dimensional position coordinate vector; i is the imaginary unit and κ_{c} is the ultraviolet cut-off wavenumber [it is assumed that velocity modes vanish when κ > κ_{c} ( [Yakhot and Orszag, 1986])].
Substituting Eqs. (4)–(8) into Eq. (1) yields
where
is the zero-order propagator and
The next step is to eliminate the Fourier transforms P and W_{nm} from Eq. (10). To eliminate P, the divergence is taken of each term in Eq. (1). As a result, Eq. (1) reduces to the following form:
Performing Fourier decomposition of each term of Eq. (13), one can obtain
Equation (14) is insensitive to changing of the dummy indices; hence, it can be recast as
The substitution of Eq. (14) into Eq. (10) eliminates the Fourier transform of the pressure,
Equation (16) was derived by using the following properties of the Kronecker delta operator:
Changing dummy indices in Eq. (16) enables recasting of this equation, such as
Combining Eqs. (16) and (18) results in
where
In order to eliminate Wmlf from Eq. (19), the convolution theorem ( [McComb, 1990]) is used. Using this theorem, Wmlf can be written as
where σ is the wavenumber (components of the vector σ); σ are the d-dimensional wavevectors; and ϖ is the frequency. Substituting Eq. (19) into Eq. (17) gives
where λ_{0} = 1 is introduced here for the perturbation analysis that will follow later on.
The random force f is assumed to be Gaussian and white noise in time. It is specified by the following Fourier transform of its two-point correlation function ( [Forster et_al, 1977]):
where ε^{*} and D_{0} are the some parameters which will be defined below.
In the same way, it is possible to draw an equation for the particles. This equation is
where
IV. RENORMALIZATION PROCEDURE AND RENORMALIZATION OF THE MOMENTUM EQUATION
To proceed with the renormalization procedure ( [Forster et_al, 1977]), velocity and force fields are separated into long-wavelength and short-wavelength modes, such as
where τ is a positive parameter; U^{<}, V^{<}, and F^{<} denote the long-wavelength modes and U^{>}, V^{>}, and F^{>} denote the short-wavelength modes.
Substituting Eqs. (27)–(29) into the transformed momentum equation (22) results in
where the superscript on operators M_{nml} and N_{nml} has the obvious interpretation ( [McComb, 1990]). Definite integrals in Eqs. (30)–(33) were taken over the range κ_{c}⁡exp−τ<κ<κ_{c}.
As the next step, the short-wavelength modes are eliminated from Eq. (30) with the help of the expansion of the short-wavelength modes as a perturbation series in the ordering parameter λ_{0},
where κ̃=κ,ω.
Substituting Eqs. (34) and (35) into Eq. (31) gives the following equations for the zero-order terms:
and the following equations for the first-order terms:
Executing the same procedure with Eq. (33), one can get
Substitution of Eq. (38) into Eq. (36) yields
and further from this
Substituting afterwards Eq. (38) into Eq. (39) brings
Now using Eq. (42), one can derive from Eq. (37)
The solution of this equation with respect with to Un1> can be written as
The next step is the elimination of the short-wavelength modes from the equation for the long-wavelength modes via substituting the series expansions, Eq. (34), into Eq. (30). From this, we have
To average out the effect of the short-wavelength modes, the averaging process is applied to Eq. (45). The averaging process will be performed using the following rules ( [McComb, 1990]):
Equation (47) is based on Eq. (23) with account for Eq. (41); see  [McComb (1990)], page 356.
Since the random force is Gaussian, the following statement holds:
According to Eq. (41), averages of U0> can be estimated through F^{>} because G_{f0} is statistically sharp. It also follows from Eq. (41) that
The averaging procedure is first applied to Eq. (45). Making use of the averaging rules given by Eqs. (46)–(49), one can simplify the terms by the coefficients λ_{0}^{0} and λ_{0}^{1} as
The term by the coefficient λ_{0}^{2} in Eq. (45) is calculated using Eq. (44). Unfortunately, a strict analytical calculation of this term from Eq. (44) is impossible. That is why we will use an approximate approach under the assumption of small values of the parameter S (a linear approach). In frames of this approach, the term by the coefficient λ_{0}^{2} in Eq. (45) is transformed as
For the sake of convenience, we do not use in Eq. (52) and below the average symbols < >, which is in line with, for instance,  [McComb (1990)],  [Yakhot and Orszag (1986)] and many other publications.
Let us consider the last term on right-hand side of Eq. (52). Following  [McComb (1990)], one can recast this term as
In calculating of the integral over υ̃, the following property of the delta-function δκ̃−υ̃ is utilized:
where Ω is an arbitrary function. Equation (53), with the help of Eq. (54), can be recast as
So one can rewrite Eq. (45) as
where
In obtaining Eqs. (56) and (57), the following replacement was performed [see  [McComb (1990)], page 358]:
Equation (57) renormalizes eddy viscosity. As the renormalization process proceeds to the fixed point, all terms by coefficients λ_{0}^{2} in Eq. (56) vanish, as shown by  [Forster et_al (1977)]. Then Eq. (56) can be simplified as
where
The next step in the renormalization procedure is redefinition of U, F, and κ_{c} without additional rescaling. After discarding the superscript < in Eq. (59), this equation takes the form of Eq. (22). Equation (59) is defined over the following interval:
whereas the original equation is defined over the following interval:
Thus, as a result of this step, the short-wavelength modes are eliminated over the following interval:
where
The effect of the short-wavelength modes is included in the renormalized viscosity. Then the renormalization procedure can be repeated to eliminate the short-wavelength modes from the next spherical layer
and so on.
V. CALCULATION OF THE TURBULENT VISCOSITY
As the next step, a differential equation for the effective viscosity (which is total of the molecular and turbulent viscosities) is obtained. For this purpose, the integral given by Eq. (57) must be calculated. At first, integration with respect to frequency is performed,
The integration with respect to ϖ is carried out in complex plane using the residue theorem. The integration function has three poles
Closing the counters of integration in the upper half-plane results in the following:
where Res is the residue and Ψϖ,σ is the symbol of the integration element.
Let us consider the case where S→0, i.e., the effect particles on turbulence is not strong,
The first term in Eq. (69) is the classical result from  [Yakhot and Orszag (1986)], whereas the second term in Eq. (69) takes into account the effect of the particles (the second phase).
Following the RNG procedure, we need to estimate the integral of Eq. (68) in the limiting case of κ → 0, ω → 0. In this limiting case, the integral (68), with account for Eq. (69), can be written as
To take the integral in Eq. (70) over the wavenumbers σ, it is necessary to use an auxiliary relation
where
is the surface area of a d-dimensional unit sphere and Γ is the gamma-function.
Integration of (70) enables deriving an expression for the renormalized viscosity,
where
To obtain a differential equation for the viscosity, Eq. (73) is differentiated with respect to τ in the limit of τ → 0 ( [Yakhot and Orszag, 1986]). In this case, the difference between the local ultraviolet cut-off wavenumbers, κ_{c}−κc′, tends to zero. Then it follows from Eq. (73) that
The subscript “0” by ν_{0} has been discarded because Eq. (75) is valid for every step of the renormalization procedure and the condition of τ → 0 leads to ν(κ_{c}) → ν(κc′).
Using Eq. (64), dτ and dκ^{′} can be interrelated as follows:
Taking into account Eq. (76) and omitting the prime (again because τ → 0), Eq. (75) can be recast as
Under the initial condition
Equation (77) does not have an analytical solution. That is why let us solve this equation using successive approximations. At first, let us assume that S = 0. Then the solution of Eq. (77) with the boundary condition (78) is
Since in the process of renormalization the value κ_{c} runs over the entire range of the wavenumbers, the index of the wavenumber is omitted.
Second, let us substitute Eq. (79) in the second term on the right-hand side of Eq. (77). After integration, one can get
In deriving Eqs. (79) and (80), the value of λ_{0} was set to unity.
Third, we need to eliminate the wavenumber from Eq. (80). To do this, we calculate the energy spectrum of turbulence given by the relation ( [Forster et_al, 1977])
where the symbol Tr denotes the trace of the matrix, i.e., the sum of its diagonal terms. To calculate this integral, we use Eq. (23) and (41) in the approximation for small values of S. As a result,
In view of Eq. (80), one can reduce Eq. (82) to the following relation:
For the case where ε^{*} = 4, Eq. (67) for S = 0 reproduces Kolmogorov’s law for the inertial part of the turbulence spectrum, whereas the parameter D_{0} can be interpreted as a quantity proportional to the dissipation rate ε.
It is necessary now to establish a connection between the parameters D_{0} and ε. It can be done using different approaches.  [Yakhot and Orszag (1986)] used for this purpose the energy balance equation for the inertial range of turbulence. In the algebraic form, this equation can be written as ( [Kraichnan, 1971])
where C_{K} is the Kolmogorov’s constant.
In the limiting case of small values of the parameter S, this equation can be recast taking into account Eq. (80). This yields
Substituting this relation into Eq. (83), one can find the connection between the parameters D_{0} and ε,
Excluding the parameters D_{0} and ε from Eqs. (85) and (86), we come to the value of Kolmogorov’s constant
Substituting Eq. (85) and (86) into Eq. (83) gives
where
Equation (83) can be used to calculate the turbulence kinetic energy,
Then we have from Eq. (90)
For the limiting case of small values of S, this relation reduces to
Substituting Eqs. (86) and (92) into Eq. (80) yields
VI. DISCUSSION
It should be pointed out that the RNG model of turbulence includes the equation for the dissipation rate. This equation includes a term that takes into account the anisotropy of turbulence at low Reynolds numbers ( [Yakhot and Orszag, 1986]). Therefore, the proposed model can also be used for small Reynolds numbers. However, it is difficult to pinpoint one specific limiting value of the Reynolds number restraining the validity range of the RNG model.
Equations (80) and (92) demonstrate that the presence of the second phase causes a decrease in the eddy viscosity. At the absence of the second phase (i.e., for S = 0), Eq. (92) takes its classical form, see  [Yakhot and Orszag (1986)],
In the three-dimensional case, d = 3 and Eq. (94) transforms to
It follows from Eq. (80) that the turbulent viscosity tends to zero (i.e., degenerates) under the following condition:
It should be pointed out that the present result is valid under the assumption of small values of the parameter S. It is not clear from the analysis above how the solid phase affects turbulent viscosity for large values of the parameter S. The authors have not managed to perform the renormalization group analysis for large values of S.
To exclude the wavenumber from Eq. (96), one can use the Gaussian filter proposed by  [Yakhot and Orszag (1986)],
which can be interpreted as an integral scale of turbulence. Also let us introduce the dissipation rate using the following relation ( [Reynolds, 1974]):
where C_{D} ≈ 0.08. Then, using Eq. (97), one can get from Eq. (96)
The integral length scale of turbulence is proportional to the size of the solid particles. Therefore, it follows from Eq. (99) that the increasing size of the particles, which constitute the solid phase or polymeric additives, results in reducing of turbulence at lower values of the parameter S_{0}. This finding makes it possible to explain the Toms effect, which consists in the drag reduction of the turbulent flow in the presence of polymer additives.
On the other hand, it follows from Eq. (99) that higher levels of turbulence in the flow require higher values of S_{0} at which turbulence degenerates.
Nowadays, rather vast experimental databases on the intensity of pulsations in flows containing solid particles are available in the literature ( [Boothroyd, 1967];  [Bouvard and Petrovic, 1973];  [Kada and Hanratty, 1960];  [Kazanskij and Bruhl, 1973];  [Patel and Tsao, 1976]; and  [Soo et_al, 1960]). For instance,  [Patel and Tsao (1976)] revealed a noticeable decrease in turbulence of flows containing small particles, which are quite easily captured by the pulsating fluid. At the same time,  [Boothroyd (1967)] did not report any effect of particles with the size range of 0-40 μm. Many researchers (for example,  [Kada and Hanratty, 1960];  [Depew and Kramer, 1973]; and  [Hinze, 1972]) believed that the influence of the solid phase on the flow turbulence intensity exhibits itself via two opposite effects: (i) flow destabilization with a significant average slip of particles and (ii) energy consumption to support pulsations of the particles. In the case of fine dispersed particles, the second factor (that causes suppression of the fluid pulsations) plays a decisive role. In flows with larger particles, the first effect (that causes additional generation of turbulence) becomes dominating. Therefore, the proposed model is valid for flows with fine dispersed particles.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
The paper focused on a study of turbulence in two-phase flows with the help of the renormalization group approach. As a result, a relation for turbulent viscosity was obtained, which takes into account the presence of the second (solid) phase in the flow. This relation reveals that the second phase causes damping of turbulence. In the limiting value of the parameter S_{0}, the relation for turbulent viscosity indicates that the turbulence damping rate is proportional to the size of the solid particles and inversely proportional to turbulence intensity (turbulent kinetic energy). This finding explains, in particular, the Toms effect of the drag reduction incurred due to adding polymer additives in the turbulent flow.
