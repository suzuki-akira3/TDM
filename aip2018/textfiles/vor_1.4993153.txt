Construction of representations of Poincaré group using Lie fields
In this paper, we give an explicit construction of the unitary irreducible representations of the Poincaré groups in 2, 3, and 4 space-time dimensions on Hilbert spaces associated with the Schrödinger representation of the Weyl algebra for n = 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Our method of constructing the representations uses extension and localization of the enveloping algebras associated with these Weyl algebras and the Poincaré algebras.
I. INTRODUCTION
Localization, or formation of quotients, provides a powerful tool in both mathematics and physics in that it enables one to relate different, i.e., non-isomorphic, algebraic structures by embedding them into larger structures and then attempting to establish that the larger structures are isomorphic. One of the most famous examples of this in mathematics, and which is very much related to what we do in this paper, is the Gelfand-Kirillov conjecture.
A brief description of it is the following. Let K be an algebraically closed field. Given a Lie algebra L over K we denote by U(L) the universal enveloping algebra of L. Since U(L) is a Noetherian domain, it admits a field of fractions which we shall denote by D(L) and which we call the Lie field of L. Let W_{n}(K) denote the Weyl algebra of index n over the field K (it is generated over K by 2n generators p_{1}, …, p_{n}, q_{1}, …, q_{n} subject to the relations [p_{i}, p_{j}] = [q_{i}, q_{j}] = 0 and [p_{i}, q_{j}] = δ_{ij} for all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n). Given a collection of free variables y_{1}, …, y_{s} we define
Being a Noetherian domain the algebra W_{n,s}(K) also admits a field of fractions denoted D_{n,s}(K). Gelfand and Kirillov put forth the following conjecture [14]:
Theorem 1. Gelfand-Kirillov conjecture. Ifchar(K)=0and L is the Lie algebra of an algebraicK-group, thenD(L)≅D_{n,s}(K)for some n, s depending on L.The conjecture was settled positively for nilpotent Lie algebras, sl(n) and gl(n), by Gel’fand and Kirillov themselves [14]. In 1973, the conjecture was confirmed in the solvable case independently by Borho [8], Joseph [21], and McConnell [26]. In 1979, Hai considered the semi-direct products of sl(n), sp(n), and so(n) with their standard modules and proved the conjecture for those L [17]. The conjecture has been shown to hold for all Lie algebras of dimension less than 9 [32].A major breakthrough for the case in which L is simple occurred in 2010 when Alexander Premet proved that the conjecture fails for simple Lie algebras of type B_{n}(n ≥ 3), D_{n}(n ≥ 4), E_{6}, E_{7}, E_{8}, or F_{4} [34]. The conjecture also makes sense over fields which are not algebraically closed. Clearly, if D(L)≅D_{n,s}(F) over a field F [where D(L) now means the Lie field of the Lie algebra L over the field F], then D(L⊗_{F}K)≅D_{n,s}(K), where L⊗_{F}K is a Lie algebra over a field extension K of F. Thus, at least for certain cases, we can reduce the case of a non-algebraically closed field F to its respective algebraic closure. In particular, this implies that the Gelfand-Kirillov conjecture itself fails for any real form of a complex Lie algebra of type B_{n}(n ≥ 3), D_{n}(n ≥ 4), E_{6}, E_{7}, E_{8}, or F_{4}. Interestingly, since B_{2} ≃ C_{2} and Premet’s results for B_{n} hold only for n ≥ 3, the physically important cases of SO_{0}(2, 3) and SO_{0}(1, 4) seem to be still unsettled.For further recent developments in our understanding of the general case (i.e., for L not simple), we refer to the paper by Alev, Ooms, and Van den Bergh [3]. They constructed a series of counterexamples to the conjecture for certain semidirect products.Finally we point out generalizations of the conjecture to quantum groups [13] and to superalgebras like osp(1, 2n) [2,30]. The results obtained by these authors encourage us to believe that what we do in this paper might permit some generalization to q-deformed de Sitter and Poincaré groups and, at least in some cases, their supersymmetric analogs.Regarding the importance of localization to physics, we recall the early work of Martinez Alonso [24,25], which deals with the situation in quantum mechanics, and also a work of Vergne, which describes a somewhat analogous situation for classical physics with the Lie bracket being replaced by a Poisson bracket [37].The localization techniques are shown to be necessary [24] for an understanding of the structure of the observables and invariants of a quantum physical system associated with a given Lie algebra and their relationship to the observables of the Weyl algebras. Certainly, such physical considerations must have played an important part in motivating Gelfand and Kirillov to formulate their conjecture. Indeed, the Gelfand-Kirillov conjecture demonstrates that for Lie groups G for which it is true, the Lie field of G is no more complicated than that of the Lie field associated with the corresponding Weyl algebra, and, in this sense, the Heisenberg canonical commutation relations can be viewed as consequences of those of the Lie algebra of G.There are also important and related results about localization in enveloping algebras of semisimple Lie algebras and those of their associated semidirect products [19,23]. The close relationship between the representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras and their associated semidirect products goes back at least as far as a paper by Mackey [23]. A very important work from the standpoint of physics is the construction by Bozek, Havlíček, and Navrátil of an explicit *-isomorphism between commutative algebraic extensions of the Lie fields of SO(1, 4) and the Poincaré group [9]. Shortly thereafter, Havlíček and Moylan [18] made use of the isomorphism described by Bozek et_al to construct representations of the Poincaré Lie algebra out of representations of SO(1, 4). There are analogous results for SO(2, 3) and the Poincaré Lie algebra except that the isomorphism of Lie fields is no longer a *-isomorphism [29]. From this result and a similar study of the other real forms of SO(5) and the much easier to analyze lower dimensional cases, it is clear that similar such isomorphisms of Lie fields of SO(p, q) and associated semidirect products of the form SO(p − 1, q) ⋉ V and SO(p, q − 1) ⋉ V must exist for all SO(p, q) groups with p + q ≤ 5.In this paper, we demonstrate the further relevance of localization to physics by showing that one of the most important problems in relativistic quantum mechanics, namely, the unitary representation theory of the Poincaré group, can be solved readily and effectively using Lie field techniques. Specifically, we realize the representations of the Poincaré group in 2, 3, and also in 4 dimensions on Hilbert spaces associated with the L^{2} Hilbert space of the Schrödinger representation of the corresponding Weyl algebras. Of course, there exist well-known tools, going back decades, for solving this problem starting with Wigner’s seminal paper on the unitary, irreducible representations (UIR’s) of the inhomogeneous Lorentz group in four spacetime dimensions [39]. Wigner’s approach formed the basis for Mackey’s general theory of induced representations [22] which we review in the Appendix as applied to the universal covering group of the n-dimensional Poincaré group. Another alternative and well-known approach consists of the method of relativistic wave equations, which for the n = 4 case is somewhat exhaustively studied in a paper by Bargmann and Wigner [5]. The possibility of generalizing the Bargmann-Wigner approach to higher dimensions has recently been considered [6].As stated above, our problem involves the construction of unitary, irreducible representations (UIR’s) of the group of motions of Minkowski space M_{n}, i.e., the Poincaré group, P_{n}, or more precisely its universal cover, P_{n}̃, in the case of n = 2, 3, and 4 dimensions. Specifically for us, irreducibility refers to “Schurean” or operator irreducibility [35]. First, we determine algebraic relations between the basis generator of the Poincaré Lie algebra and Heisenberg pairs using techniques related to the Gelfand-Kirillov conjecture. With these relations we are able to realize the representations of the Poincaré Lie algebra p_{n} on Hilbert spaces associated with the L^{2} Hilbert space of the Schrödinger representation of the corresponding Weyl algebras. Then we show that basis elements of p_{n} can be directly integrated to (strongly continuous) unitary one-parameter subgroups on these Hilbert spaces. It finally remains to show that such representations of p_{n} integrate to representations of the corresponding P_{n}̃. This is the most difficult part. Standard methods of approach to this problem are based on techniques centering around Nelson’s theorem [20,31] about the essential selfadjointness of the Nelson operator. In our approach, we simply verify by hand the group property for arbitrary products of the one parameter unitary subgroups thus assuring in the n = 2 case a global group representation. The fact that we have global group representations for the n = 2 case permits an explicit comparison of the representations which we obtain with the complete list of all unitary irreducible representations obtained from the Mackey-Wigner method. This is done in the Appendix. For the other two cases, we content ourselves with establishing that we have at least locally defined group representations. For precise definitions of the local Lie group and local Lie group representation, we refer the reader to Chap. 1 of Ref [27]. For alternatives to the Nelson theorem approach for integration of Lie algebras of unbounded operators to global Lie group representations, we refer the reader to Refs [20],  [28], and  [33].
II. NOTATION AND METHOD
P_{n} can be identified with the group of (n + 1) × (n + 1) matrices of the form
where
and
In what follows, we restrict ourselves to the component SO_{0}(1, n − 1) of O(1, n − 1) which contains the identity element, i.e.,
Similarly we consider hereafter only the restricted Poincaré group which we also refer to as P_{n} and which can be viewed as a semidirect product SO_{0}(1, n − 1) ⋉ T^{n}, where
is the translation group in n dimensions and I_{n} is n × n identity matrix.
For any g(Λ,a→), we have
where the sets
are one-parametric subgroups. The Lie algebra p_{n} of the group P_{n} has n2(n+1) independent generators P_{μ}, μ = 0, …, n − 1, L_{0j}, j = 1, …, n − 1, and L_{ij}, 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n − 1 and the following commutation relations:
where
for 0 ≤ μ, ν, ρ, τ ≤ n − 1. The symbols L_{μν}, P_{μ} usually denote abstract generators. However, when needed, we use the following explicit matrices:
The enveloping algebra U(p_{n}) is a real associative algebra equipped with a natural involutive automorphism ^{†} given by [11]
which naturally extends to an involution of the whole Lie field also denoted by ^{†}.
The first step in our consideration is to look for suitable Heisenberg pairs in the Lie field D(p_{n}). It turns out that we are able to find 2(n − 1) elements
in U(p_{n}) that copy the structure of the Weyl algebra, i.e., satisfy analogous commutation and involutive relations. Namely, we require
In the case n = 4, we must, moreover, introduce a skew-symmetric element S_{23} and symmetric elements S_{12}, S_{13}, which satisfy
where
are Casimir elements. The important property of our formulas expressing these elements S_{ij}, q_{k}, p_{k} as functions of the generators L_{μν} and P_{μ} is that they can be inverted, i.e., the initial generators L_{μν} can be expressed as functions of the newly defined ones. In other words, we can obtain a realization of p_{n} by means of generators of the Weyl algebra, Casimir operators, and, for n = 4, the generators S_{12}, S_{13}, S_{23} of the “little algebra.” The realization is skew-symmetric as a consequence of the existence of the above involutive automorphism of the Heisenberg pairs and, for n = 4, symmetricity properties of the elements S_{ij}.
The second step of our considerations is the substitution q_{j} → ix_{j}, p_{j}→−i∂_{xj} and the substitution of Casimir elements by numeric multiples of identity operator. In this way, we obtain the skew-symmetric, Schurean representation of p_{n} on L^{2}(R^{n−1}) with a suitable common dense domain C0∞((R−{0})×R^{n−2}) (the space of all smooth functions with compact support) [38]. Somewhat more complicated is the case of n = 4, since we have to take into account the extra elements S_{ij}.
It turns out that the basis elements of p_{n} in the Schurean representations of p_{n} can be formally integrated into unitary one-parametric subgroups. We are able to show that these subgroups are strongly continuous and therefore, following Stone’s theorem, their selfadjoint generators are selfadjoint extensions of our representations of the basis elements. The products of these subgroups form an N-parametric set (N = 3 for p_{2}, N = 6 for p_{3}, and N = 10 for p_{4}) of unitary operators.
In order to show that this n-parametric set of unitary operators is, in fact, a unitary representation of P_{n}̃, we simply verify the representation property of the group by direct calculation which is possible due to the relatively simple form of all one-parametric subgroups. This gives, in the case n = 2, an explicit construction of all unitary representations of the whole group P_{2}̃ and in the other cases all (local) unitary representations of P_{n} in some neighborhood of the unit element of P_{n}. Locally P_{n}̃ is the same as P_{n}, so we do not distinguish between (local) representations of P_{n}̃ and P_{n} for these other cases.
We believe that our method yields all unitary representations of the considered P_{n}̃. This should follow from a comparison of our results with those from the standard description of the UIR’s of P_{n}̃ based on the Mackey theory [23], which for the cases of P_{3} and P_{4} are known [4,16,39]. We are able to make such explicit comparison for the n = 2 case, since for this case our method gives global group representations of P_{n}̃. This comparison is done in the Appendix. We note that the standard Mackey-Wigner treatment for the P_{2}̃ case is somewhat different than in the higher dimensional cases due to the homogeneous part, i.e., the Lorentz subgroup being SO_{0}(1, 1). For example, the massless orbits are the connected components of the isotropic cone in R^{2}, i.e., 4 half lines instead of two half lines, and all little groups are trivial, except for the case when the little group is the entire SO_{0}(1, 1) (cf. the Appendix). This detailed comparison for the P_{2}̃ case serves to illustrate how the explicit comparison with our results for the other cases should be made.
III. THE CASE P_{2}
The Lie algebra p_{2} has the following commutation relations:
from which we immediately obtain
Let us set
so we have
The expression for p can be simplified using the relation
and we obtain
Using the Casimir operator M^{2}=P12−P02, the relations (1) and (2) can be inverted and we have
Note 1. Equations (3) define an explicit mapping τ_{2} from W_{1,1}(R) into D(p_{2}) with M being the free variable in this case. Since τ̃{2} is injective, as follows easily from the fact that W_{1}(R) is simple and hence there are no nontrivial ideals, it extends uniquely to a mapping τ̃{2} from D_{1,1}(R) into D(p_{2}). Alternatively, injectivity can be proved by hand [9] considering general linear combination of the elements from PBW (Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt) basis such as ∑_{j,k,l}α_{jkl}P0jP1kL01l. The extended mapping is obviously injective as well and, due to Eqs. (1) and (2), it is clearly furthermore surjective. Altogether, τ̃{2} provides an explicit isomorphism establishing the Gelfand-Kirillov conjecture for this real form of p2C, where p2C=p_{2}⊗_{R}C is the complexification of p_{2}. We note that for the other real form of p2C, which is so(2)⊕R^{2}, no such isomorphism exists, and the Gelfand-Kirillov conjecture fails to hold for this case [1].
The second step is the substitution q → ix, p → −i∂_{x}, M^{2} → m^{2}I, m^{2}∈R. It gives from (3) the skew-symmetric Schurean representation of p_{2} on L^{2}(R),
After integration we obtain
for any ψ∈L^{2}(R). The operators U_{j}(t), j = 1, 2, 3 form three one-parametric subgroups.
Theorem 2. U_{j}(t) is unitary for all t. Moreover, U_{j}is strongly continuous.
Proof. The proof follows from the following general lemma.
Lemma 3. Let{U(t)|t∈R}be a set of unitary operators onL^{2}(R^{m}), such that U(t)U(s) = U(t + s) for alls,t∈R. If there are continuous functions
such that
for anyψ∈L^{2}(R^{m}), then the mapping t → U(t) is strong continuous onR.
Proof. One has to show that the following holds for any t_{0}∈R and ψ∈L^{2}(R^{m}):
Since U(t) is unitary and thus ∥U(t)∥ = 1, t∈R, we have
and thus we may assume, without loss of generality, t_{0} = 0. Further, it is sufficient to prove (6) for any ψ from a certain dense subset of L^{2}(R^{m}).Thus, take any ψ∈C0∞((R−{0})×R^{m−1}) and δ > 0. For x∈(R−{0})×R^{m−1} and t ∈ [−δ, δ], we have
Clearly, the right-hand side belongs to L^{2}(R^{m}), so we can use the Lebesgue theorem in order to show
But then
A direct consequence of the above theorem is that the mapping
is strong continuous. The explicit form of the operators (7), namely,
allows us to easily compute the multiplication law: we have
This proves that the considered mapping (8) is, for any m^{2}∈R, a unitary representation of the group P_{2} on L^{2}(R).Note 2. The representation (8) is reducible: the subspaces L^{2}(R^{+}) and L^{2}(R^{−}) are clearly invariant subspaces under U_{m}(t_{1}, t_{2}, t_{3}), independently of sign of m^{2}∈R. We have
where Um(±) are restrictions of U_{m} to L^{2}(R^{±}). These representations are irreducible. This is seen as follows. The operator Y, commuting with P_{0} − P_{1} = ix, has the form Yψ(x) = y(x)ψ(x) (see Ref [7], Example 6.6.3, p. 233, and Theorem 5.5.6, p. 180). Commuting further a Y of this form with U_{1}(t) leads necessarily to Y being a scalar multiple of identity operator, which proves irreducibility of the representation. Further, the irreducible representations Um(+) and Um(−) are inequivalent: in the case m^{2} ≥ 0, the (non-empty) spectrum of the generator P_{0}|_{L^{2}(R^{±})} is a subset of iR^{±}, i.e., they are necessarily different. The same can be shown for P_{1} when m^{2} < 0. So for any value of Casimir operator m^{2}, we have two inequivalent irreducible representations.For the isometry mapping
we have
In the case m^{2} = 0, considerations about inequivalent representations are dealt with in the following way. The mappings a_{i}:p_{2}→p_{2}, i = 1, 2, 3, defined as
are automorphisms of p_{2} which are not inner. That means that when we apply the automorphisms to the representation (4) of p_{2}, we get representations that need not be necessarily equivalent. In such a way, we obtain three new representations U0(1), U0(2), U0(3) of the group P_{2} for which we have
These, together with U0(+), are mutually inequivalent (it is easily seen by a spectral argument). The representation U0(−) is equivalent to U0(1) through the isomorphism (9).In the case m ≠ 0, the same argument with automorphisms (10) can also be used; however, now two “new” representations are equivalent to two “old” ones through the isometry operator R̃ψ(x)=|m|xψ|m|^{2}x, ψ∈L^{2}(R^{+}).In the Appendix, the unitary irreducible representations of P_{2} are obtained from the Mackey-Wigner method and compared with our construction; for m^{2} > 0, there are two such representations and their explicit form is
The generators P_{0} and P_{1} of one-parametric groups Um,±″(0,t_{2},0) and Um,±″(0,0,t_{3}) are
so that P12−P02=m^{2}. The parameter m^{2} in the Mackey-Wigner construction connects with value of the Casimir operator. The same connection should also hold for the cases P_{3} and P_{4}.We see that the Mackey-Wigner construction generates two unitary irreducible representations for every fixed m^{2} > 0 and our unitary irreducible representations must be equivalent to the Mackey-Wigner unitary irreducible representations. The following isometry mappings
realize such isomorphisms of the representations Um± and Um,±″. The same assertion is valid also in the cases m^{2} = 0 and m^{2} < 0. For the detailed analysis, see the Appendix.
IV. THE CASE P_{3}
The Lie algebra p_{3} has the following commutation relations:
and the other commutation relations are equal to zero. The Casimir operators of p_{3} are
Similarly as in the case of p_{2} we let
The second pair is defined as
We easily verify that
Equations (12) and (13) can be solved for L_{μν} and P_{μ}. Also as in the case of p_{2} we have
The sixth and last generator, which we determine with the help of Casimir element (11), can be written in the form
from which we have
and from the point of view of future calculations we find it convenient to represent the sixth generator implicitly in the form
The second step is, as in the p_{2} case, the substitution q_{j} → ix_{j}, p_{j}→−i∂_{xj}, j = 1, 2, M^{2} → m^{2}I, C → cI, where m^{2},c∈R, which gives us the following skew-symmetric Schurean representation of p_{3} on L^{2}(R^{2}):
After integration we obtain three one-parametric subgroups similar as in the case of p_{2}, namely,
The remaining three one-parametric subgroups are given by the formulas
where
and ψ∈L^{2}(R^{2}) (m denotes principal square root of m^{2}).
Note 3. To prove the group property in the case of U_{6}(t), one needs the following formula for a logarithm of a complex number: for any z,z^{′}∈C, we have ln z + ln z′ = ln zz′ + 2πiε, where ε ∈ {0, 1, −1} depending on values of z, z′. If m^{2} > 0, we have
which means that U_{6}(t) is the one-parametric subgroup if and only if cm∈Z. In the case m^{2} < 0, ε = 0 and the one-parametric subgroup arises without limitation for any value of cm.
Using Eqs. (15)–(20), we easily see that the conditions of Lemma 3 are satisfied for each of our one parameter subgroups so that each of the six one parameter subgroups forms a strongly continuous unitary representation of the given subgroup of P_{3}. Thus the mapping
is strong continuous on some neighborhood of the origin of R^{6} into some neighborhood of the identity in the unitary group on L^{2}(R^{2}).
To show that the mapping (21) is indeed a (local) representation of P_{3}, i.e., a Lie group homomorphism from a neighborhood of the identity in P_{3} to unitary operators on L^{2}(R^{2}), we need to verify it satisfies the group multiplication law. Thus,
Theorem 4. For (t_{1}, …, t_{6}) and(t1′,…,t6′)sufficiently close to the origin inR^{6}, we have
with(t1″,…,t6″)continuously depending on(t_{1},…,t_{6}),(t1′,…,t6′)∈R^{6}.
Proof. It is not difficult to show that Bruhat decomposition for the SO_{0}(1, 2) subgroup of P_{3} gives the following:
for t_{5}t_{6} ≠ 1. Another way to establish Eq. (22) is to exploit the local isomorphism between SO_{0}(1, 2) and SL(2,R) and to make use of the following generators of the Lie algebra sl(2,R), namely,
They fulfil the same relations as L_{01}, L_{12} − L_{02}, and L_{12} + L_{02}, i.e., these operators form a representation of (23). One-parametric subgroups corresponding to (23) are
It is straightforward to show that the one-parametric subgroups (24) fulfil the same relation (22) as U_{1}, U_{5}, and U_{6}.Exploiting the semidirect product structure of P_{3} the following relations are similarly verified to be true:
Repeated use of them together with Eq. (22) enables us to successively permute the twelve one-parametric subgroups in the product U(t_{1},…,t_{6})U(t1′,…,t6′) so as to reorder them in the desired way in order to obtain U(t1″,…,t6″).Note 4. From straightforward computational work we are able to obtain out of the proof of the theorem the following explicit relationship between the parameters ti″ and the t_{i} and ti′:
Note 5. Regarding irreducibility of the representations (21), the cases m^{2} ≥ 0 and m^{2} < 0 are different. If m^{2} ≥ 0, then the subspaces L^{2}(R^{±}×R), similarly as in the case of P_{2}, are invariant [it is because x1(t)=1x_{1}(x1−x2t){2}+m^{2}, i.e., sgnx1(t)=sgnx_{1}]. For the representation (21), we have
Let us now show that the representations U^{±} are irreducible. The most general form of operator commuting with P_{0} − P_{1} = ix_{1} and P_{2} = ix_{2} has the form Yψ(x_{1}, x_{2}) = y(x_{1}, x_{2})ψ(x_{1}, x_{2}) (see Ref [7], Ex. 6.6.3, Theorem 5.5.6). Again, as in the case P_{2}, commutation with the one-parametric subgroups U_{1}(t), U_{5}(t), and U_{6}(t) [Eqs. (15), (19), and (20)] gives Y being a scalar multiple of the identity operator.The nonequivalence of U^{(−)} and U^{(+)} is proved by a spectral argument as in the case of P_{2}. If m^{2} < 0, the representation is irreducible for all c∈R by the same arguments as in the preceding case.
V. THE CASE P_{4}
Because P_{4} contains P_{3} as a subgroup, we define first two Heisenberg pairs by Eqs. (12) and (13). In addition, P_{4} contains another copy of P_{3} generated by L_{01}, L_{03}, L_{13}, P_{0}, P_{1}, and P_{3}, thus we can substitute 2 → 3 in Eq. (13) and obtain the definition of the third pair,
It is an easy exercise to verify commutativity of p_{3} and q_{3} with p_{2} and q_{2}. Let us further introduce the following elements of D(p_{4}):
where
The elements (27) commute with all three pairs p_{i}, q_{i}, i = 1, 2, 3. Moreover,
which can be verified by direct computation. The Casimir element of the (scaled) Lie algebra defined by the S_{ij} is given by
The generators L_{μν} can be expressed by means of Heisenberg pairs and the elements S_{12}, S_{13}, S_{23}. For the generators L_{01}, L_{12} − L_{02}, P_{0}, P_{1}, P_{2} Eq. (14) remains valid (with M^{2} replaced by M^{2}−q32) and inverting (26) and (27) we obtain
The next step is the substitution
We obtain
The operators s_{ij} are skew-symmetric and fulfil the relations
Similarly, as for S^{2} in Eq. (29), the operator
commutes with all s_{ij} and is taken to be a scalar multiple of the identity, i.e.,
For s_{ij} we choose an integrable skew-symmetric irreducible representation leading to a unitary representation of corresponding group. In other words, s_{ij} are operators on some Hilbert space V with scalar product (., .)_{V}, where
and the exponential function exp(αs_{12} + βs_{13} + γs_{23}) exists and it is an unitary irreducible representation of the corresponding group. The relations (31) determine different Lie algebras depending upon the sign of m^{2}. The simplest situation arises when m^{2} > 0. Then the relations (31) are commutation relations of the Lie algebra so(3) and the corresponding group is SO(3). The operators s_{ij} are now (2s + 1) × (2s + 1) dimensional matrices of usual skew-symmetric representation, α = s(s + 1) in (33) and V=C^{2s+1}, s=0,12,1,…. In the case m^{2} > 0, this is the unique possibility. If m^{2} < 0, the relations (31) are commutation relations of the Lie algebra so(2, 1) and the corresponding group is SO(2, 1). The choice of unitary irreducible representation determines the choice of V. The same conclusion arises when m = 0, and the relations (31) are commutation relations of the Euclidean Lie algebra e(2).
Concerning the first five one-parametric subgroups, the integration of the Lie algebra defined by Eqs. (30) proceeds similarly as in the case of p_{3}: it is sufficient to replace m^{2}→m^{2}+x32 and use formulas (15)–(19). We get
where ψ∈L^{2}(R^{3}), v∈V. The first two additional subgroups are easy to obtain, and they are given by (indices are chosen to correspond the P_{3} case)
and are clearly unitary strong continuous. Therefore the problem reduces to the computation of three remaining subgroups corresponding to L_{23}, L_{12} + L_{02}, and L_{13} + L_{03}. The generator L_{23} is equal to the sum of two commuting parts (x_{2}∂_{x3}−x_{3}∂_{x2} and s_{23}), which means that the integration is essentially simplified. We have
For the next generator we obtain
where
The last generator is given by
where
The operators ρ_{6} and ρ_{10} acting on the space V are unitary (under the standard scalar product (., .)_{V} on V=C^{2s+1}) as they can be rewritten in the form of exp(αs_{12} + βs_{13} + γs_{23}) for some α,β,γ∈R. Consequently, the operators U_{8}(t), U_{6}(t), and U_{10}(t) are unitary on V⊗L^{2}(R^{3}). All unitary operators U_{1}(t), …, U_{10}(t) are one-parametric subgroups which can be directly verified (the proofs are very similar to those in the case of P_{3}). As to U_{6}(t), we use note 3 (after substitution m→m^{2}+x32) and as to U_{10}(t) we use note 3 again (after substitution x_{2} ↔ x_{3} and m→m^{2}+x22). When m^{2} > 0, instead of the constant 2cm, we have now a matrix exponent 1m^{2}+x32(2x_{3}s_{23}−s_{12}) or 1m^{2}+x22(−2x_{2}s_{23}−s_{13}). The operators ŝ_{12}=12ms_{12}, ŝ_{13}=12ms_{13}, ŝ_{23} = s_{23} fulfil the usual commutation relations of su(2), i.e., [ŝ_{23}, ŝ_{12}] = ŝ_{13}, [ŝ_{13}, ŝ_{23}] = ŝ_{12}, [ŝ_{12}, ŝ_{13}] = ŝ_{23} so that 1m^{2}+x32(x_{3}s_{23}−12s_{12})=x_{3}m^{2}+x32ŝ_{23}−mm^{2}+x32ŝ_{12}. The combination ŝ23′=cosωŝ_{23}−sinωŝ_{12}, where cos⁡ω=x_{3}m^{2}+x32, sin⁡ω=mm^{2}+x32 can be extended by ŝ12′=−sin⁡ωŝ_{23}+cosωŝ_{12}, ŝ13′=ŝ_{13} to an automorphism of su(2). Any such automorphism is inner; therefore, ŝ23′ is, in a (2s + 1)-dimensional irreducible representation, equal to the diagonal matrix diag (s, s − 1, …, −s) with s a natural or half-natural number, i.e., ŝ23′=R(x_{3})ŝ23″R(x_{3}), where R(x_{3}) is some unitary matrix. Thus we have
and the one-parametric property is fulfilled. The same conclusion is valid for U_{10}(t). In the case m^{2} ≤ 0, the factor ε = 0 and the one-parametric relation is valid without limitation.
It remains to discuss the question of irreducibility and to generalize the relations (22) and (25) to the case of P_{4}.Note 6. For the proof that
is a representation of P_{4}, one needs [besides the relations (22)] to know how to commute the product in the “opposite” order. As to permutation of the translation subgroups with subgroups of Lorentz group, it is almost evident that they have the same form as in the case of P_{3}. In this way, we obtain 24 relations including 9 relations (25). For permutation of one-parametric subgroups of the Lorentz group, we use exploit the well-known two-dimensional representation of sl(2,C). In addition to the matrices l_{01}, l_{12} − l_{02}, l_{12}+l_{02}∈sl(2,C), where
let us take
These matrices satisfy the commutation relations of the Lorentz group and their real span is a faithful representation of this Lie algebra. One-parametric subgroups generated by these generators have the form
One can show that a certain product can be written in the opposite order: we have
Now we use (22) which is valid also for the complex values of parameters,
where
and finally
so that
Verification of this relation for one-parametric subgroups U_{10}(t_{10}), …is equivalent to permutation of their pairs. These relations are, again, evident, with the exception of subgroups U_{6}(t_{6}), U_{10}(t_{10}), and U_{8}(t_{8}), which contain the operators s_{12}, s_{13}, and s_{23}. For them we obtain the following relations:
Let us show that these relations hold. First, using unitarity, we derive from Eq. (36)
and, after substitution t_{6} → −t_{6}, we have
Comparing with (36) we obtain (38). Next, using the relation
which is a consequence of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula, we have
Application of this formula shows that Eq. (37) is also a consequence of Eq. (36).
Thus it is sufficient to prove (36). In order to do this, it is sufficient to show the following:
First we check this relation in the two-dimensional representation of (31), namely, s_{12}=−m0ii0, s_{13}=m01−10, and s_{23}=12i00−i. Then
and both sides of (39) are equal to
Let us now show that the validity of (39) for dimension two implies validity of this relation for a representation of su(2) of any dimension.
Lemma 5. If Eq. (39) is fulfilled for representations s = (s_{12}, s_{13}, s_{23}) ands^{′}=(s12′,s13′,s23′), it is fulfilled for tensor productsij⊗=s_{ij}⊗I+I⊗sij′.
Proof. Denote ρ_{6} and ρ_{10} from Eqs. (34) and (35) as ρ6(s)(α), ρ10(s)(β) and let us write Eq. (39) in the form
The tensor product with the identity operator I (on the representation space of representation s) or with the identity operator I′ (on the space of representation s′) gives
from which we, further, obtain
and
As operators s ⊗ I′ and I ⊗ s commute, the relation can be finally rewritten in the final form
The representation s^{⊗} is reducible and equals to a direct sum of irreducible ones (three- and one-dimensional) and Eq. (39) is true for these representations separately. It is known that for any irreducible representation of su(2) there is one irreducible part of the tensor product of n two-dimensional representations, if n is sufficiently high [12]. So the independence of Eq. (39) on the dimension of the su(2) representation is established.
VI. CONCLUSION
The Heisenberg pairs, in the case of p_{n}, n = 2, 3, are expressed by means of the elements from U(p_{n}) and by means of (P0−P1){−1} only. From the inversion formulas (3) and (14), we see that the generators L_{μν} and P_{μ} are expressed by polynomials in the Heisenberg pairs p_{i}, q_{j} with the presence of only one generator, q_{1}, in the denominators.
The semigroup {(P0−P1){m}|m=0,1,…} is the set of denominators in U(p_{n}) and a localization [11] of U(p_{n}) with respect to this semigroup can be defined as
We can now consider the associative algebra W_{1,1} generated by one Heisenberg pair p′, q′ and extended by one central symmetric element z′. We can define its localization
The mapping Φ_{2}:Ũ(p_{2})→W̃{1,1} defined by the relations
is a *-isomorphism [it preserves the involution of the localizations Ũ(p_{2}) and W̃{1,1}].
Similarly we can connect the localizations Ũ(p_{3}) and W̃{2,2}: let us consider W_{2,2}, which is generated by the pairs p1′,q1′,p2′,q2′ and the central symmetric elements z1′,z2′ and take
Then the *-isomorphism Φ_{3}:Ũ(p_{3})→W̃{2,2} is now given by
The case P_{4} is more complicated. First, we need to create a *-extension of the center by the element M, where M^{†} = −M and its square coincides with (28). Then we can define the fourth Heisenberg pair
From (29) we have
and from these relations we can express, inversely, the elements S_{12}, S_{13}, S_{23} by means of p_{4}, q_{4} and the Casimir element S^{2}. For the fourth order Casimir operator W of p_{4}, which has the form
we find after a lengthy calculation
which means that S^{2} lies in the field of the center of p_{4}. Let us now define a localization in a slightly generalized sense [36],
which is isomorphic to
through the mapping
It is clear that the isomorphisms Φ_{2} and Φ_{3} can be extended to isomorphisms of Lie fields, D(p_{2}) with D(W_{1,1}) and D(p_{3}) with D(W_{2,2}), respectively. The theorem of Gelfand and Kirillov about the existence of an isomorphism of the Lie field of an algebraic Lie algebra and a Lie field of a certain extension of W_{n} [15] is thus proved for p_{n}, n = 2, 3. On the other hand, only a weakened version of the analogous assertion is true for p_{4}. Namely, D(W_{4,2}) is isomorphic to the above introduced central extension of D(p_{4}).
One should note that the techniques of Lie field computation used in this article can be successfully used also in the case of other types of algebras besides the enveloping algebras of Lie algebras, most generally, for algebras satisfying the Ore condition, and thus can be embedded in a (skew) field of fractions [10]. As examples of such we have Lie superalgebras and also various quantum deformations of these structures [30].
APPENDIX: COMPARISON OF OUR RESULTS WITH THE UNITARY IRREDUCIBLE REPRESENTATIONS OF P_{2}
Here we shall determine how the Casimir operator M^{2}=P12−P02 is represented in terms of the representations constructed in the previous paragraph. First, for the representations U|m|,±″ we have
and
hence M^{2}=−m^{2}(sinh^{2}⁡x−cosh^{2}x)I=m^{2}I. Analogously, in the case U|m|,±‴ we obtain P_{0} = (±i|m| sinh x) I and P_{1} = (∓i|m| cosh x) I, hence M^{2}=−m^{2}I. Finally, for Uε,±′ one has P_{0} = (±ie^{εx}) I and P_{1} = (∓εie^{εx}) I, thus M^{2} = 0.
We now see that the set of irreducible unitary representations of P_{2} constructed in terms of the Lie field agrees almost exactly with the “standard” representations obtained due to the Mackey theory, with parameter m having the same meaning in both cases. There are exactly two inequivalent representations for each m^{2}=m^{2}>0 and m^{2}=−m^{2}<0, but we obtain only two of four “massless” representations. This mismatch can be removed by considering an additional parameter within the construction, as shown in the following paragraph.
Let ε be equal to either +1 or −1. We can generalize the definitions (1) and (2) of the Heisenberg pair by setting
since one can easily check that the desired relations
still hold true. Repeating the procedure from Sec. II exactly, i.e., solving (A9) for the generators of p_{2}, substituting q_{ε} ↦ ix, p ↦ −i∂_{x}, M^{2} ↦ m^{2}I, m^{2}∈R, integrating, and restricting to L^{2}(R^{±}), we end up with the following representations:
For m^{2} = 0, the momentum generators are represented as P_{0}=ix2 and P_{1}=−εix2; therefore, the same considerations as in Note 2 lead to mutual non-equivalence of the four massless representations. For each m^{2} ≠ 0, however, we have four representations now instead of two. It is shown in the following paragraph that in fact in this case, adding the parameter ε amounts to just equivalent forms of the representations which we already have.
Finally we shall explicitly demonstrate the equivalence of our representations with the standard ones. Let us define, for any m>0 and ε = ±1, the following isometry mappings Rm,ε±:L^{2}(R^{±},dx)→L^{2}(R,dx):
Take an arbitrary ψ∈L^{2}(R^{±},dx). First, for 0<m^{2}=m^{2} one can show that
hence Um,ε(±)≅Um,±″. In particular this means Um,1(±)≅Um,−1(±). Second, if 0>m^{2}=−m^{2},
where “±ε = ±” or “±ε = ∓” for ε equal to 1 or −1, respectively. Therefore Um,ε(±)≅Um,±ε‴ and, again, Um,1(±)≅Um,−1(∓). Finally, for 0=m^{2}=m we have
and thus U0,ε(±)≅Uε,±′.
