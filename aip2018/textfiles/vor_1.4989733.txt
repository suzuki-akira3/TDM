Scattering theory for multistate Schrödinger operators
We study multistate Schrödinger operators related to molecular dynamics. We consider potentials which do not necessarily decay and prove the absence of the singular continuous spectrum and propagation estimates which mean the scattering at speed larger than a positive constant and decay of the state with potentials higher than the considered energy at infinity. We also consider the multistate Schrödinger operators with many-body structures. We obtain the Mourre estimate and the minimal velocity estimate for the many-body operators. The lower bound of the velocity is determined by the distance between the energy and thresholds below the energy.
I. INTRODUCTION
In the study of molecular dynamics, the Born–Oppenheimer approximation plays a central role. In the Born–Oppenheimer approximation, several electronic energy levels which are smaller than the total energy for some positions of nuclei are considered. These electronic levels are functions of the nuclear coordinates x and regarded as potentials for nuclei. It is expected that if the total energy is larger than an electronic level in a certain direction at infinity, then the nuclei scatter, that is, the distance between some nuclei tends to infinity. This seems to be true even if the classical trajectory with the total energy for some electronic level is trapped in a bounded region because of the transition between electronic levels due to their interaction. We verify this intuition in this paper under some conditions.
In this paper, we consider the multistate Schrödinger operator
where diag(A_{1}, …, A_{m}) is a diagonal matrix whose elements are A_{1}, …, A_{m} and R(x, D_{x}) is a matrix of first-order differential operators. These kind of operators are obtained by the reduction scheme for the many-body problem for electrons and nuclei called the Born–Oppenheimer approximation (see the studies of Klein et_al [1], Martinez and Messirdi [2], and Martinez and Sordoni [3]). In the Born–Oppenheimer approximation, a small parameter h which is the ratio of electronic and nuclear masses appears in front of the Laplacian Δ and in R, and the asymptotics as h → 0 of the positions of the resonances of P (see, e.g., Refs [4–11]) and the time evolution of the initial state corresponding to resonances (see Ref [12]) were studied. The structure of the scattering matrices for short-range potentials and short-range off-diagonal elements at nontrapping energy was also studied by Refs [13] and  [14].
Here we plan to prove the absence of the singular continuous spectrum and propagation estimates for potentials which do not necessarily decay at infinity. Our method is based on the Mourre estimate for P. To prove the Mourre estimate at energy λ, we assume either that each diagonal operator satisfies the Mourre estimate at λ with the same conjugate operator A = (x·p + p·x)/2 or that potentials are the sum of a homogeneous function of degree zero outside a compact set and a decaying function, where λ is not the critical value of the homogeneous potentials and the gradients of the homogeneous potentials satisfy some condition at λ. We also assume weak decay of R(x, D_{x}). In the case of homogeneous potentials, our method to prove the Mourre estimate is similar to that in the work of Agmon, Cruz-Sampedro, and Herbst [15] which modifies the conjugate operator from the generator of dilations. We also consider multistate Schrödinger operators with many-body structures in which the off-diagonal elements may not decay in all directions. We describe the structure of the thresholds and obtain the Mourre estimate with positivity determined by the distance d(λ) from energy λ to the nearest threshold below λ.
As an application of the Mourre estimate, we prove the low velocity estimate which means that for the initial state with energy λ at which the Mourre estimate holds scatters at speed larger than some constant. The low velocity estimate is proved using the abstract theory in the work of Skibsted [16], which also gives the large velocity estimate. As a consequence of the low velocity estimate, we can see that states with potentials larger than λ at infinity decay as time passes. In the many-body case, the lower bound of the velocity is given by the distance d(λ).
In Sec. II, we introduce our assumptions and state our main results. In Sec. III, we prove the Mourre estimates for multistate Schrödinger operators. In Sec. IV, applying the Mourre estimates, we obtain the propagation estimates. We determine the essential spectrum of multistate Schrödinger operators in the Appendix.
II. ASSUMPTIONS AND RESULTS
We consider the m-state Schrödinger operator
on H≔⊕j=1mL^{2}(R^{n}), where P_{j} = −Δ + V_{j}(x) with real valued functions V_{j} and R(x,D_{x})=(rj,k(x,Dx)){1≤j,k≤m} is a symmetric matrix of first-order differential operators. As for R(x, D_{x}), we assume the following.
Assumption II.1. r_{jk}=r̃{jk}(x)⋅∇+r^{j,k}(x), where for anyl∈N, r^{jk}∈C^{∞}(R^{n},C)satisfies|(x⋅∇){l}r^{jk}(x)|=o(1)as |x| → ∞ andr̃{jk}∈C^{∞}(R^{n},C{n})satisfies|(x⋅∇){l}(r̃jk(x)){i}|=o(1)as |x| → ∞. Here(r̃jk(x)){i}is the i-th component ofr̃{jk}(x).As for P_{j}, fixing λ∈R, we suppose one of the following assumptions.
Assumption II.2. Let λ be a real number. For j = 1, …, m, P_{j}and λ satisfy
(1) For anyl∈N, we have(x⋅∇){l}V_{j}(x)∈L^{∞}(R^{n}).
(2) Setting A = (x·p + p·x)/2, where p = −i∇, there exist γ_{j}, δ_{j} > 0, and a compact operator K_{j}such that denoting byE_{Pj}(I)the spectral projection for P_{j}onto the interval I_{j} = (λ − δ_{j}, λ + δ_{j}), we have
Assumption II.3. Let λ be a real number. For j = 1, …, m, we have V_{j}(x) =Ṽ{j}(x) + W_{j}(x), whereṼ{j}and W_{j}are real valued and satisfy the following:
(1) Ṽ{j}∈C^{∞}(R^{n})is homogeneous of degree zero for |x| ≥ 1/2 and λ is not the critical value of the functions S^{n−1}∋ω↦ Ṽ{j}(ω), j = 1, …, m.
(2) Let ω_{k} ∈ S^{n−1}, k = 1, …, N, be all the directions such thatṼ{j}(ω_{k}) = λ for some j and setJ_{ωk}≔{j∈N|1≤j≤m,Ṽ{j}(ω_{k})=λ}. Then
for anyj∈J_{ωk}.
(3) W_{j}∈C^{∞}(R^{n})satisfies | ∂^{α}W_{j}(x)| = o(|x|^{−|α|}) for anyα∈N{n}.
Remark II.4. If#J_{ωk}=1, then (2.3) is equivalent to ∇Ṽ{j}(ω_{k}) ≠ 0.Our main result is the following theorem.
Theorem II.5. Suppose Assumption II.1 and either Assumption II.2 or II.3, then the following holds.
(i) For λ in Assumption II.2 or II.3, there exists δ_{0} > 0 such that in I_{0} = (λ − δ_{0}, λ + δ_{0}) there are only a finite number of eigenvalues of P and there is no singular continuous spectrum of P.
(ii) If λ_{0} ∈ I_{0}is not an eigenvalue of P, then forf∈C0∞(R)supported in a sufficiently small neighborhood of λ_{0}and any s′ > s > 0, there exist constantsλ^{′′} > λ′ > 0 such that
as t → +∞, where ϕ(y < λ′) and ϕ(y > λ″) are the indicator functions for (−∞, λ′) and (λ″, +∞), respectively, and1is the m-dimensional identity matrix so that g(x)1 = diag(g(x), …, g(x)) for a function g(x). Moreover, in the case of Assumption II.2, we can take arbitrary λ′ < 2min{γ_{1}, …, γ_{m}} in the first estimate.
Corollary II.6. Suppose Assumption II.1, either Assumption II.2 or II.3, and
for some ρ > 0. Let λ_{0}be a number as in Theorem II.5 (ii). Then if lim inf_{x→∞}V_{j}(x) > λ_{0}, for any s, s′ > 0 satisfying s < s′ and s ≤ ρ and anyf∈C0∞(R)supported in a sufficiently small neighborhood of λ_{0}, we have
as t → +∞, where E_{jj}is the matrix whose element in the j-th row and j-th column is 1 and the others are 0.
Remarks II.7. (1) The following example explains the results in a typical situation. We assume m = 2. If V_{1}(x) = −C⟨x⟩^{−1}, where C > 0, then the interval (−∞, 0) consists of only a discrete spectrum and a resolvent set. If λ < 0, Assumption II.2 holds for P_{1}since letting δ_{1}be small enough andf_{1}∈C0∞(R^{n})be a function such that suppf_{1} ⊂ (−∞, 0) andE_{P1}(I_{1})f_{1}(P_{1})=E_{P1}(I_{1})and using the almost analytic extension (see the proof of Theorem III.2), we can see that f_{1}(P_{1}) − f_{1}(−Δ) is compact and f_{1}(−Δ) = 0. Moreover, if V_{2} ≡ c < λ with a constant c, it is easy to confirm Assumption II.2 for P_{2}. Thus choosing λ_{0}as in Theorem II.5,u∈Ran f(P)(⟨x⟩{−s′}1)scatters by the first estimate of Theorem II.5 (ii) forf∈C0∞(R)supported in a sufficiently small neighborhood of λ_{0}. This is obvious if R(x, D_{x}) ≡ 0 since in that case u_{1} ≡ 0 and u_{2}scatters freely. For this case, λ_{0}∈σ_{pp}(P) = σ_{pp}(P_{1}), and therefore
However, when R(x, D_{x}) ≠ 0, u_{1}may not be 0. In this case, as we can see by Corollary II.6, u_{1}vanishes being converted into u_{2}by the interaction between electronic levels and u_{2}scatters as in Theorem II.5 (ii).(2) The restriction s ≤ ρ cannot seem to be removed since the decay rate of the interactions between the components ofu∈Hby the off-diagonal terms is estimated as O(t^{−ρ}) by Theorem II.5 (ii).Next we consider multistate Schrödinger operators with many-body structures. In the theory of the Born–Oppenheimer approximation, since more than two nuclei can share electrons, there seem to be interactions among more than two nuclei. Therefore, it seems natural to assume that P has a generalized many-body structure in which the interactions among any number of particles can be considered. To describe the generalized many-body structure, we introduce some notations [see, e.g., the work of Dereziński and Gérard [17] (chap. 5)].Set X=R^{n} and suppose that
is a finite family of subspaces of X. Let
be the smallest family of subspaces of X satisfying the following conditions:
(1) X belongs to (2.5);
(2) the family (2.5) is closed with respect to intersection;
(3) the family (2.4) is contained in (2.5).We endow A with a semi-lattice structure by
We denote the minimal and maximal elements in A by a_{min} and a_{max}, that is,
We assume that X_{amax}={0}. We denote the orthogonal complement of X_{a} by X^{a}. We denote by Π^{a} and Π_{a} the orthogonal projections of X onto X^{a} and X_{a}, respectively. We use the same notations Π^{a} and Π_{a} for the corresponding orthogonal projections of the dual space of X. We define for all x ∈ X, x_{a} = Π_{a}x and x^{a} = Π^{a}x. We also define ∇_{a} = Π_{a}∇ and ∇^{a} = Π^{a}∇. The operators −Δ_{a} and −Δ^{a} denote the Laplacian in X_{a} and X^{a}, respectively.We assume that for every j = 1, …, m and b∈B we are given real functions X^{b}∋x^{b}↦vjb(x^{b}) and vja_{min}=0. Let c_{1}, …, c_{m} be real numbers. We set
Denoting the complexification of X^{b} by (Xb){C}, for any j, k = 1, …, m let r̃jkb(x^{b}) (respectively, r^jkb(x^{b})) be a (Xb){C}-valued (respectively, C-valued) function. We assume r̃jka_{min}=0,r^jka_{min}=0. We set
Using these notations, we define P as (2.1) and P^{a} for a ≠ a_{min} as follows:
where Pja≔−Δ^{a}+Vja. We suppose the following assumptions on vjb, r̃jkb, and r^jkb.
Assumption II.8. We assume for anyj,k=1,…,m,b∈B, vjb,r^jkb∈C^{∞}(X^{b},C)andr̃jkb∈C^{∞}(X^{b},(Xb){C}). Moreover, we assume for anyl∈N, |(xb⋅∇b){l}vjb(x^{b})|=o(1), |(xb⋅∇b){l}r^jkb(x^{b})|=o(1), and|(xb⋅∇b){l}(r̃jkb){i}(x^{b})|=o(1)as |x^{b}| → ∞, where(r̃jkb){i},i=1,…,dimX^{b}is the i-th component ofr̃jkbwith respect to some basis of(Xb){C}.We define the set of thresholds for a ≠ a_{min} as
where σ_{pp}(Q) is the set of pure point spectra of Q and b < a means b ≤ a and b ≠ a. The set T^{amax} is simply denoted by T. Moreover, we set Σ^{a}≔inf(T^{a}) and Σ≔Σ^{amax}=inf(T). Then exactly as in the proof of HVZ (Hunziker-Van Winter-Zhislin) theorem (see, e.g., Ref [17], Theorem 6.2.2), we have the following proposition.
Proposition II.9. Suppose Assumption II.8. Then we have
where σ_{ess}(Q) is the essential spectrum of Q.
Remark II.10. In the construction of the Weyl sequence as in the proof of the usual HVZ theorem, we regardH=⊕j=1mL^{2}(R^{n})asL^{2}(X_{a})⊗⊕j=1mL^{2}(X^{a}).For λ ≥Σ, we define
We have the Mourre estimate and propagation estimates for P.
Theorem II.11. Suppose Assumption II.8. Then we have the following:
(i) P does not have a singular continuous spectrum,T∪σ_{pp}(P)is a closed countable set, and σ_{pp}(P) can accumulate only atT.
(ii) For any λ ≥Σ and ϵ > 0, there exist δ > 0 and a compact operator K such that
whereA=diag(A,…,A), A:=(x·p + p·x)/2, and I := (λ − δ, λ + δ).
(iii) Let λ > Σ such thatλ∉T∪σ_{pp}(P)and ϵ > 0 be given. Then forf∈C0∞(R)supported in a sufficiently small neighborhood of λ and any s′ > s > 0, we have
as t → +∞ and there exists a constant λ′ > 0 such that
as t → +∞.
Remarks II.12. (1) In the Mourre estimate, singularities of potentials could be allowed (see Ref [17]). In the propagation estimate (iii), proving the Mourre estimate for another conjugate operator using Graf’s vector field, singularities of potentials would be allowed. Here we use the usual conjugate operator A for the simple proof of the Mourre estimate. (2) In general, the propagation estimate as in Corollary II.6 cannot seem to hold for many-body operators because the interactions between the components ofu∈Hmay not decay as time passes.
III. THE MOURRE ESTIMATE
In this section, we prove the Mourre estimates for P under Assumptions II.1 and II.2 or II.3. First, we consider the case of Assumption II.3. We can find functions χ_{j}(x)∈C^{∞}(R^{n}) satisfying the following conditions. χ_{j}(x) are homogeneous of degree zero for |x| ≥ 1/2, and the map ω ↦ χ_{j}(ω) satisfies χ_{j}(ω) = 1 in a sufficiently close neighborhood of ω_{k} such that j∈J_{ωk}, that is, V_{j}(ω_{k}) = λ and χ_{j}(ω) = 0 in neighborhoods of other ω_{k}.
For β > 0, we set a(x)≔(1−2β∑j=1mṼ{j}(x)χ_{j}(x))|x|^{2}/4 and
where p = −i∇. Then it is easy to see that A_{V} is essentially self-adjoint on C0∞(R^{n}). We have the Mourre estimate for P̃{j}≔−Δ+Ṽ{j} and A_{V} at λ in Assumption II.3.
Lemma III.1. Suppose Assumption II.3 and let A_{V}be as in (3.1). Then for j = 1, …, m and β > 0 sufficiently small, there are constantsδ̃{j},γ̃{j}>and compact operators K_{j}such that
whereI_{j}=(λ−δ̃{j},λ+δ̃{j}).
Proof. As in Ref [15], Appendix C, we calculate
where
Since x·∇Ṽ{j}(x) = 0 for |x| ≥ 1, we have G(x) → 0 as |x| → ∞. For sufficiently small β, we also have −4∑k,l=1n∂_{k}akl(2)(x)∂_{l}≥−Δ. Thus it remains to show
for some γ̃{j}>0 and some compact operator K.By the definition of χ_{j} and Assumption II.3, there exist ϵ > 0 and γ^{j}>0 such that the following holds. We have {ω∈S^{n−1}|λ−2ϵ<Ṽ{j}(ω)<λ+2ϵ}=⋃_{j∈Jωk}Ω_{k}, where Ω_{k} ∈ S^{n−1} are disjoint and satisfy the following:
(1) ω_{k} ∈ Ω_{k}.
(2) If ω ∈ Ω_{k}, we have χ_{l}(ω) = 1 for l∈J_{ωk} and χ_{l}(ω) = 0 for l∉J_{ωk}.
(3) For ω ∈ Ω_{k}, we have
As in Ref [15], Appendix C, the sphere S^{n−1} is the union of open sets
There is a partition of unity of R^{n}: φ_{1} + φ_{2} + φ_{3} + η^{2} = 1, where φ_{k} is homogeneous of degree 0 for |x| > 3/4, supp η ⊂ {x| |x| < 1}, and supp φ_{k}⊂{x||x|>1/2,x/|x|∈O_{k}}.Let f∈C0∞(R) be a function such that f = 1 near a small neighborhood of λ. Since E_{P̃j}(I_{j})f(P̃{j})=E_{P̃j}(I_{j}) for δ̃{j} small enough, we only need to prove (3.2) replacing E_{P̃j}(I_{j}) by f(P̃{j}). Moreover we can choose f such that supp f ⊂ [λ −ϵ/2, λ + ϵ/2].In the following, we denote compact operators by K̃{l},l=1,2,…. We can write
In the support of φ_{1}, using (3.3), we have
As for φ_{2} and φ_{3}, choosing sufficiently small β, we can obtain in the same way as in Ref [15], Appendix C,
Choosing γ̃{j}=min{βγ^{j},ϵ/3} and adding (3.4) and (3.5), we obtain (3.2) with E_{P̃j}(I_{j}) replaced by f(P̃{j}).Using Lemma III.1, we can obtain the Mourre estimate for P.
Theorem III.2. Suppose Assumptions II.1 and II.3 and let A_{V}be as in (3.1). Then there are constants δ, γ_{0} > 0, and a compact operator K such that
where I = (λ − δ, λ + δ) andA_{V}≔diag(A_{V},…,A_{V}).
Proof. Let f∈C0∞(R) be a function such that f = 1 near a small neighborhood of λ. As in the proof of Lemma III.1, we only need to prove (3.6) replacing E_{P}(I) by f(P). In the following, we denote compact operators by K_{j}, j = 1, 2, …. Note that a matrix of operators is compact if and only if all its elements are compact. Since D(P)=⊕j=1mH^{2}(R^{n}), by Assumptions II.1 and II.3 on the decay of R(x, D_{x}) and W_{j}, it is easy to see that f(P)[diag(W_{1},…,W_{m})+R(x,D_{x}),A_{V}]f(P) is a compact operator. Thus setting P̃≔diag(−Δ+Ṽ{1},…,−Δ+Ṽ{m})=diag(P̃{1},…,P̃{m}), we have
where K is compact.Let F be an almost analytic extension of f (see, e.g., Ref [17]). Then we have
By Assumptions II.1 and II.3, we can see easily that the right-hand side of (3.8) is compact. Thus we have
By the uniqueness of the functional calculus, we can see that
Therefore, by Lemma III.1, we can see that for f supported in a sufficiently small neighborhood of λ with γ_{0}=min{γ̃{1},…,γ̃{m}},
Using (3.8) again, we obtain
Combining (3.7) and (3.9)–(3.11), we obtain the theorem.In the case of Assumption II.2, we can prove the Mourre estimate in the same way as Theorem III.2 using Assumption II.2 (2) instead of Lemma III.1.
Theorem III.3. Suppose Assumptions II.1 and II.2 and set A = (x·p + p·x)/2, where p := −i∇. Then there is a constant δ > 0 and a compact operator K such that
where I = (λ − δ, λ + δ), γ_{0}:= min{γ_{1}, …, γ_{m}}, andA≔diag(A,…,A).By Theorem III.2 (respectively, Theorem III.3) and Assumptions II.1 and II.2 (respectively, II.3), we can prove that there exists the limit of the resolvent R(z) of P as operators between certain Banach spaces as z tends to a continuous spectrum applying the method of Mourre [18]. As a result, using Stone’s formula, we obtain Theorem II.5 (i).Finally, we consider the many-body case.
Proof of Theorem II.11 (i) and (ii). The proof of Theorem II.11 (i) and (ii) is very similar to that of the usual many-body Hamiltonian (see Ref [17], Sec. 6.4). The differences are the following points. Set P_{amin}≔diag(−Δ+c_{1},…,−Δ+c_{m}) and for λ ≥ min{c_{1}, …, c_{m}},
Then given ϵ > 0 and λ∈R, there exists δ > 0 such that
where I = (λ − δ, λ + δ). Estimate (3.12) follows from that
that for λ ≥ c_{j} we have
and that if λ < c_{j}, for δ < c_{j} − λ and any α > 0, we have
since E_{−Δ+cj}(I)=0.Another difference is that we use the decay not only of (Ij){a}(x)≔V_{j}(x)−Vja(x^{a}) but also of R_{a}(x,D_{x})≔R(x,D_{x})−R^{a}(x^{a},D_{x^{a}}) when |x^{b}|→∞ for all b≤a. We omit the details of the proof.
IV. PROPAGATION ESTIMATES
In this section, we prove Theorem II.5 (2), Corollary II.6, and Theorem II.11. We apply the abstract theory of propagation estimates in the work of Skibsted [16]. We need the following class of functions with a parameter τ (see Ref [16], Definition 2.1).
Definition IV.1. Given β, α ≥ 0 and ϵ > 0, letF_{β,α,ϵ}denote the set of functionsg,g(x,τ)=g_{β,α,ϵ}(x,τ)≔−τ^{−β}(−x){α}χxτ,defined for(x,τ)∈R×R^{+}and forχ∈C^{∞}(R)with the following properties:
whereχ̃(x)≥0andχ̃(x)∈C^{∞}(R).In this paper, we consider only F_{0,α,ϵ}, but to avoid the unnecessary change of the notation from Ref [16], we keep the index β.In the proof of the propagation estimates, sometimes χ(G < −ϵ) denotes χ(G) for a self-adjoint operator G, where χ is smooth and satisfies the first three properties enlisted above.To prove the propagation estimates for P, we confirm Assumption 2.2 (1)-(5) and the assumption in Corollary 2.6 in Ref [16] replacing A(τ) and B (respectively, H) by certain self-adjoint operators (respectively, P). We write the assumptions in the form we need here.
Assumption IV.2. Let A(τ) and B be self-adjoint operators. Assume with τ = t + 1, t ≥ 0, that the operators A(τ) have a common domainD, D(P)∩Dis dense inD(P), B ≥ I, and⟨A(1)⟩{n}B^{−n}∈L(H)for anyn∈N. We assume moreover the following:
(1) WithadA(τ)0(P)=Pfor anyn∈N,n≥1, the formi^{n}adA(τ)n(P)=i[i^{n−1}adA(τ)n−1(P),A(τ)]onD(P)∩Dextends to a symmetric operator with domainD(P).
(2) If A(1) is unbounded,sup|s|<1∥Pe^{iA(τ)s}ψ∥<∞for anyψ∈D(P)and τ ≥ 1.
(3) For any τ_{1}, τ_{2} ≥ 1, A(τ_{1}) − A(τ_{2}) is bounded, and derivatived_{τ}A(τ)=ddτA(τ)exists inL(H). For anyn∈N,n≥1, and τ ≥ 1, the form
onDextends to a bounded self-adjoint operator onH.
(4) For anyn∈N, adA(τ)n(P)(P−i){−1}andadA(τ)n(d_{τ}A(τ))are continuousL(H)-valued functions of τ ≥ 1.
(5) For anyn∈N, adA(τ)n(d_{τ}A(τ))=O(1)andadA(τ)n(P)(P−i){−1}=O(1)as τ → +∞.
(6) Let DA(τ) denote the symmetric operator i[P, A(τ)] + d_{τ}A(τ). There exist bounded operators B_{1}(τ) and B_{2}(τ) and δ > 0 such that
as τ → +∞, and for anyn∈N, the following estimate holds:
Given ϵ > 0 andg(x,τ)∈F_{0,n,ϵ}, there exists C > 0 such that
whereζ(t)=(g(1)(A(τ),τ)){1/2}e^{−itP}f(P)B^{−n/2}ϕ.
Remark IV.3. When A(1) is unbounded and Assumption IV.2(2) is satisfied, instead of Assumption IV.2(1), we only need to prove that there exists a subspaceS⊂D(P)∩Dwhich is dense inD(P)such thate^{iA(τ)s}S⊂S(|s|<1)and the assumption holds withD(P)∩Dreplaced byS[see Ref [16], Remark 2.3(3)].Applying Theorem 2.4 and Corollary 2.6 in Ref [16] and interpolating with respect to α, we obtain
Lemma IV.4. Suppose Assumption IV.2, then for any α, ϵ > 0 andg(x,τ)∈F_{0,α,ϵ},
inL(H)as t → ∞, where τ = t + 1.
Proof of Theorem II.5 (ii). We consider the case of Assumption II.3. Let A_{V} and γ_{0} be as in Theorem III.2. Fix 0<γ0′<γ_{0} and as in Ref [16], Example 1, set for τ > 0, Ã(τ)≔A_{V}−γ0′τ1=diag(Ã(τ),…,Ã(τ)), where Ã(τ)≔A_{V}−γ0′τ. We shall confirm Assumption IV.2 with A(τ) and B replaced by Ã(τ) and ⟨A_{V}⟩, respectively, where ⟨G⟩≔(1+G2){1/2}.As for Assumption IV.2(2), we note e^{iÃ(τ)s}=diag(e^{iÃ(τ)s},…,e^{iÃ(τ)s}). The action of e^{iÃ(τ)s} can be expressed explicitly in terms of the flow associated with the vector field ∇a (see Ref [16], Example 1, and Ref [18], Appendix I, in which the roles of p and x are interchanged). Using this expression, one can readily verify Assumption IV.2(2). Assumption IV.2(1) follows from Remark IV.3. Assumptions IV.2(3)–(5) are easily confirmed.As for Assumption IV.2(6) using Theorem III.2 and noting that E_{P}(Ĩ)K → 0 as δ̃→0 where Ĩ≔[λ_{0}−δ̃,λ_{0}+δ̃], we can see that f_{1}(P)DÃ(τ)f_{1}(P)≥0 for f_{1}∈C0∞(R) supported in a small neighborhood of λ_{0}. Thus Lemma IV.4 yields (4.2) for any α, ϵ > 0 with A(τ) and B replaced by Ã(τ) and ⟨A_{V}⟩, respectively. Since for β, α ≥ 0 and 1 ≥ θ ≥ 0 we have
(see Corollary 2.5 in Ref [16]), we obtain
for any s ≥ 1/2 and ϵ > 0.We shall prove the first estimate in Theorem II.5 (ii). Given ϵ″ > 0, let g(x,τ)∈F_{0,1,ϵ{″}}, that is,
as in Definition IV.1. Fix 0<γ0″<γ0′ and set A^{′}(τ)≔diag(g(−τM,τ),…,g(−τM,τ)), where M=M(x,τ)≔γ0″2−a(x)τ2{1/2}.We shall confirm Assumption IV.2 with A(τ) and B replaced by A^{′}(τ) and ⟨AV⟩{1+κ}, where κ > 0 is arbitrary. It is easy to see that Assumptions IV.2(1)–(5) hold. As for Assumption IV.2(6), as in Ref [16], Example 2, we have
The first term is non-negative. As for the second term let R≔2iτ[R(x,D_{x}),a(x)1]. Then the element in the jth row and kth column of R is R_{jk}=2iτr̃{jk}⋅∇a(x). Let χ^∈C^{∞}(R) be a function supported in (−∞, −ϵ″/2) such that χ^=1 on (−∞, −ϵ″]. Then we have
If β in a(x) is small enough, we have
for some C > 0 on supp χ^(−M). Thus noting that |∇a(x)| ≤ C|x| for some C > 0, we can see that there exists C_{0} > 0 such that
uniformly with respect to τ and x.Let f_{2}∈C0∞(R) be a function such that f_{2}f_{1} = f_{1}. Then since we have
we obtain
Letting f_{3}∈C0∞(R) be a function such that f_{3}f_{2} = f_{2}, by (4.6) and Assumption II.1, we can see that
for some C_{1} > 0 and a compact operator K.If the support of f_{2} is small enough, we have −C_{1}f_{2}(P)Kf_{2}(P)>−ϵ̃1 with ϵ̃>0 satisfying γ0′−γ0‴>ϵ̃. Therefore, combining (4.5), (4.7), and (4.8), we obtain
Thus as in Ref [16], Example 2, observing
with ϵ^{′}=(γ0′−γ0″−ϵ̃)/2 and using (4.4), we obtain (4.1) and therefore (4.2) for any α, ϵ > 0 with A(τ) and B replaced by A^{′}(τ) and ⟨AV⟩{1+κ}, respectively.Therefore, noting that g_{β,α,ϵ}(A^{′}(τ),τ)=g_{β,α,ϵ}(−τM1,τ) for any ϵ > 2ϵ″, we obtain by (4.3)
for any ϵ, κ, s > 0. Since AVn(P−i){−n}(⟨x⟩{−n}1) is bounded for any n∈N and we have a(x)τ^{2}<C|x|^{2}τ^{2}, choosing ϵ small enough we obtain the first estimate of Theorem II.5 (ii) with λ^{′}=(γ0″/2−2ϵ)/C.Next we consider the second estimate. For v > 0, we set A^(τ)≔(vτ−⟨x⟩)1. Then as in Ref [16], Example 3, for f_{1}∈C0∞(R) and v large enough, we have
and obtain (4.2) for any α, ϵ > 0 with A(τ) and B replaced by A^(τ) and ⟨x⟩, respectively. Therefore, by (4.3), the second estimate of Theorem II.5 (ii) holds. If λ′ > λ″, the two estimates are contradictory so that we have λ″ > λ′.In the same way as above, we can obtain the estimates for Assumption II.2. In the case of Assumption II.2, we replace a(x) in the definition of M by |x|^{2}/4. Since γ_{0} = min{γ_{1}, …, γ_{m}} and we can take arbitrary γ0′ and γ0″ such that 0<γ0″<γ0′<γ_{0}, we can take arbitrary λ′ < 2min{γ_{1}, …, γ_{m}} in the first estimate.
Proof of Corollary II.6. By the assumption there exists a function W(x)∈C0∞(R^{n}) such that infx∈R^{n}(V_{j}(x)+W(x))>λ_{0}. Set P^≔diag(P_{1},…,P_{j}+W,…,P_{m}). Let f_{1}∈C0∞(R) such that f_{1}f = f. Then we can write
As for the first term in the right-hand side of (4.9), we have
Since P_{j} + W > λ_{0}, we have f_{1}(P_{j} + W) = 0 if f and f_{1} are supported in a sufficiently small neighborhood of λ_{0}. Thus we have E_{jj}f_{1}(P^)=0.As for the second term using an almost analytic extension F_{1} of f_{1}, we have
By the assumption and the definition of W, we have (f_{1}(P)−f_{1}(P^))(⟨x⟩{ρ}1)∈L(H). Thus we only need to prove
as t → +∞ for s, s′ > 0 such that s < s′ and s ≤ ρ.We can write
Choosing f supported in a sufficiently small neighborhood of λ_{0} and λ′ as in Theorem II.5(ii), the first term is estimated as O(t^{−s}) for 0 < s < s′. By the estimate
the second term is estimated as O(t^{−ρ}), and we obtain (4.10).
Proof of Theorem II.11 (iii). The proof of Theorem II.11 (iii) is similar to that of Theorem II.5 (ii). Estimate (4.4) is proved for Ã(τ)=A−γ0′τ1 with any 0<γ0′<2d(λ) and A=diag(A,…,A), where A := (x·p + p·x)/2.In the definition of M, we replace a(x) by S^{2}2GxS, where S > 0 and G(x) is the convex function whose gradient is Graf’s vector field (see, e.g., Ref [17], Lemma 5.2.7). We enlist the properties of G we use.
Lemma IV.5. G(x) is a smooth convex function and satisfy the following:
(1) max{x^{2}, C_{1}} ≤ 2G(x) ≤ x^{2} + C_{2}for some C_{1}, C_{2} > 0.
(2) 
(3) There exists a constant δ > 0 such that for anya∈A, if |x^{a}| < δ, G(x) depends only on x_{a}.Equation (4.5) is obtained with 0<γ0″<γ0′ and the factors Ã(τ) and 2iτ[R(x,D_{x}),a(x)1] replaced by
and R̃≔2iτR(x,D_{x}),S^{2}2GxS1, respectively. As for Ã{′}(τ), by (4.11) we get ∥τ^{−1}(Ã{′}(τ)−Ã(τ))f_{2}(P)∥_{L(H)}≤CSτ^{−1} for some C > 0 with f_{2} as in the proof of Theorem II.5 (ii). Thus we can replace Ã{′}(τ) by Ã(τ).As for R̃, the element in the jth row and kth column of R̃ is
Let χ^ be the function introduced in the proof of Theorem II.5 (ii). We write
Then by (4.11), we have
for some C > 0. However, by Lemma IV.5 (1) on supp χ^(−M), we have
for some C > 0. Thus the first term in the right-hand side of (4.12) is uniformly bounded with respect to S and τ. Similarly, by the first inequality in Lemma IV.5 (1), on supp χ^(−M) we have x^{2}/τ^{2} < C for some C > 0 so that the second term in the right-hand side of (4.12) is also bounded uniformly bounded with respect to S and τ. By Lemma IV.5 (3) and Assumption II.8, r̃jkb(x^{b})→0 as S → +∞ on supp ∇^{b}GxS so that R̃{jk}χ^(−M)→0 as S → +∞. Thus for 0<ϵ̃<γ0′−γ0″, if we choose sufficiently large S, we have (χ^(−M)1)R̃(χ^(−M)1)≥−ϵ̃1.Since γ0″ and γ0′ can be arbitrarily close to 2d(λ), for any ϵ if S is sufficiently large, as in the proof of Theorem II.5 (ii), we have
for any ϵ, κ, s > 0. Using the second inequality in Lemma IV.5 (1), we obtain the first estimate in Theorem II.11 (iii). The proof of the second estimate is completely the same as that of Theorem II.5 (ii).
APPENDIX: THE ESSENTIAL SPECTRUM OF MULTISTATE SCHRŐDINGER OPERATORS
In this appendix, we consider the essential spectrum of P. Under Assumption II.3, we can determine the essential spectra of P_{j}.
Proposition A.1. Suppose Assumption II.3. Then σ_{ess}(P_{j}) = [Σ_{j}, +∞), whereΣ_{j}≔minω∈S^{n−1}Ṽ{j}(ω).
Proof. Assume λ ≥ Σ_{j}. Noting for some ω_{0} we have Σ_{j} = Ṽ{j}(ω_{0}), we take u^{k}=k^{−n/2}e^{i(λ−Σj)1/2x}ϕx−k^{2}ω_{0}k, where ϕ∈C0∞(R^{n}) satisfy ∥ϕ∥ = 1. Then it is easy to see that u^{k} is a Weyl sequence for λ of P_{j} (see, e.g., Ref [19]).On the contrary, if λ < Σ, then there exist W̃∈C0∞(R^{n}) and c > 0 such that P_{j}+W̃−λ>c and λ is not a spectrum of P_{j}+W̃. By Weyl’s theorem σ_{ess}(P_{j})=σ_{ess}(P_{j}+W̃) so that λ∉σ_{ess}(P_{j}).We can determine the essential spectrum of P from that of P_{j}.
Proposition A.2. Suppose Assumptions II.1 and II.2 or II.3. Thenσ_{ess}(P)=⋃j=1mσ_{ess}(P_{j}).
Proof. Set P_{0} := diag(P_{1}, …, P_{m}). First, we shall prove σ_{ess}(P_{0})=⋃j=1mσ_{ess}(P_{j}). If λ ∈ σ_{ess}(P_{j}) for some j, we can find a Weyl sequence u^{k} for P_{j} and λ. Then the sequence ũ^{k}∈⊕l=1mL^{2}(R^{n}) whose jth element is u^{k} and the others are 0 is a Weyl sequence for P_{0} and λ.Conversely, if ũ^{k}=(u1k,…,umk) is a Weyl sequence for P_{0} and λ, we have ∥ujk∥≥1/m for some j and for infinitely many k. Then it is easy to see that choosing a subsequence ujk_{l} of ujk, ujk_{l}/∥ujk_{l}∥ is a Weyl sequence for P_{j} and λ.We can write P = P_{0} + R(x, D_{x}) and it is easy to see that R(x, D_{x}) is P_{0}-compact. Thus by Weyl’s theorem, σ_{ess}(P) = σ_{ess}(P_{0}), which completes the proof.
