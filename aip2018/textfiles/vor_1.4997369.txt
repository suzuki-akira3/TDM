High n-type Sb dopant activation in Ge-rich poly-Ge_{1−}_{x}Sn_{x} layers on SiO_{2} using pulsed laser annealing in flowing water
Heavy n-type doping in polycrystalline Ge (poly-Ge) is still under development owing to the low solid solubility and the low activation ratio of group-V dopants in Ge. To solve this problem, we have investigated ultra-short (55 ns) laser pulse annealing in flowing water for Sb-doped amorphous Ge_{1−}_{x}Sn_{x} layers (x ≈ 0.02) on SiO_{2}. It is found that fully melting a Ge_{1−}_{x}Sn_{x} layer down to the Ge_{1−}_{x}Sn_{x}/SiO_{2} interface leads to a large grained (∼0.8 μmϕ) growth, resulting in not only a high electrical activation ratio (∼60%) of Sb atoms in the polycrystals but also a high electron density around 10^{20} cm^{−3}. As a result, the electron mobility in the Ge-rich poly-Ge_{1−}_{x}Sn_{x} layers exceeds that in single-crystalline Si even in the region of a high electron density around 10^{20} cm^{−3}. The low thermal budget process opens up the possibility for developing Ge_{1−}_{x}Sn_{x} based devices fabricated on 3D integrated circuits as well as flexible substrates.
Low-temperature formation of p-type and n-type group-IV semiconductors such as silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), or their alloys on insulating layers has been expected to open up a higher degree of freedom for the fabrication of devices such as thin-film thermoelectric generators and 3D integrated circuits (3D-ICs). To prevent the softening of flexible substrates (e.g., glass, plastic, and paper) and interference with the fabrication process for 3D-ICs, it is essential to develop a low thermal budget process for not only polycrystallization of the semiconductors but also dopant activation. In this respect, Ge is an interesting material owing to its higher carrier mobility [1] and lower polycrystallization temperature [2] than those of Si. Both p-type [3–6] and n-type [7,8] metal-oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) have been individually fabricated using polycrystalline Ge (poly-Ge) layers by many researchers; in addition, poly-Ge complementary MOS (CMOS) operation has been recently developed by Kamata et_al [9] These demonstrations of the device fabrication and the operation are quite informative in the field of 3D-ICs. However, the activation temperatures after an ion implantation of n-type dopants are slightly too high; a high carrier concentration around 10^{20} cm^{−3} of the n-type dopants in source and drain areas has not been realized for poly-Ge layers although it is essential for enhancing the drive current in the on state of the devices.
Heavy n-type doping is still under development even for single-crystalline Ge owing to the low solid solubility [10] and the low activation ratio [11] of group-V dopants in Ge. For the conventional methods such as solid phase crystallization (SPC) [12] and metal induced crystallization (MIC) [12] of phosphorus (P) doped amorphous Ge (a-Ge), the activation ratios were extremely low as 0.3% and 0.05%, respectively. Recently, some melting methods were reported for P-doped a-Ge with the P content of ∼10^{20} cm^{−3}. Matsumura et_al [13] reported that, by using a rapid melting growth (at 980 °C for 1 s) from a Si seed, a single-crystalline Ge-on-insulator with laterally graded P profiles was obtained, resulting in a maximum electron concentration of 5 × 10^{18} cm^{−3}. Koike et_al [14] reported that, by using a flash lamp annealing (FLA) with a short annealing time of 10 ms, a relatively high activation ratio of 13% was obtained, resulting in a relatively high electron density of ∼10^{19} cm^{−3}. On the basis of these studies, we suggested that preventing the dopant segregation during the melting process is a key to achieving heavy n-type doping around 10^{20} cm^{−3}. Our idea to solve the problem, that is simultaneous realization of the low temperature process and heavy n-type doping, is the use of pulsed laser annealing (PLA) in water with an ultra-short annealing time of 55 ns [15]. In our previous study on PLA in water of undoped a-Ge_{0.98}Sn_{0.02} layers [16], it was revealed that Sn atoms play a role in preventing ablation and aggregation of the layers during the PLA, which allows for use of a higher energy laser, resulting in a large grained (∼0.8 μmϕ) growth. In this paper, we aim to reveal the crystallographic and electrical properties of Sb-doped Ge-rich poly-Ge_{1−}_{x}Sn_{x} layers (x ≈0.02) with various Sb contents grown on SiO_{2} by using the PLA in water. To guarantee a low thermal budget process of the PLA in water as well as clarify the temperature distribution in the layers, temporal evolution of the temperatures during the crystallization and dopant activation process will also be discussed.
An n-type Si(001) wafer covered with a 1-μm-thick SiO_{2} layer was used as a substrate. A 50-nm-thick a-Ge_{1−}_{x}Sn_{x}:Sb layer was deposited on the substrate at room temperature (RT) using the molecular beam deposition method with a solid source at a deposition rate of ∼0.04 nm/s. The incorporation contents of Sn and Sb atoms were chosen as 2% and 2–6 × 10^{20} cm^{−3}, respectively. These contents were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, where a surface contamination on the layers was etched off by argon sputtering in the analysis chamber before the measurements. The a-Ge_{1−}_{x}Sn_{x}:Sb layers were crystalized by the irradiation with a 55-ns KrF excimer laser (wavelength: 248 nm) in flowing deionized water at RT. The detailed experimental setup for the PLA in the water is described in our previous report [16]. The beam width on the sample surface was 800 μm. The relative movement between the sample and the laser beam was achieved by a moving stage with the speed of ∼180 μm/s. The laser energy (E) was set in the range of 50–320 mJ/cm^{2}, and the laser beam was pulsed 20 times at an irradiated area. The temporal evolution of temperatures was numerically calculated by solving the 1-dimensional heat diffusion equation (RCCM Quick Therm), where the H_{2}O(50 μm)/a-Ge(50 nm)/SiO_{2}(1 μm)/Si(40 μm) structure was used. It should be indicated that in the calculation, we use the physical properties of a-Ge rather than a-Ge_{0.98}Sn_{0.02} because the data of a-Ge_{0.98}Sn_{0.02} are not available.
The calculated temporal evolution of the temperatures at H_{2}O/a-Ge and a-Ge/SiO_{2} interfaces is presented in Fig. 1(a). From these data, the maximum temperatures at the interfaces were evaluated as a function of E [Fig. 1(b)]. It is clear that the E dependence is classified into three ranges: (A) unmelted (E < 190 mJ/cm^{2}), (B) melted but the depth does not reach the a-Ge/SiO_{2} interface (190 ≤ E < 250 mJ/cm^{2}), and (C) fully melted down to the a-Ge/SiO_{2} interface (E ≥ 250 mJ/cm^{2}). Raman spectroscopy measurements revealed that all deposited layers after PLA in water at the different E values were crystallized (not shown here). Sharp peaks associated with the Ge-Ge vibration mode were clearly observed for all samples. It was found that the peak position for the Ge_{1−}_{x}Sn_{x} layer was shifted to the lower wave number than that for the pure-Ge layer. The shifted value (1.1–1.7 cm^{−1}) is related to a substitutional Sn content. As a result, we obtained the substitutional Sn content as 1.4–2.0%, which is consistent with our previous report on the PLA of undoped Ge_{1−}_{x}Sn_{x} layers with the initial Sn content of 2% [16] (see supplementary material for details).
The electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD; ULVAC PHI 700Xi) measurement was performed in order to determine the in-plane grain size of crystalized Ge_{1−}_{x}Sn_{x} layers. Crystal orientation maps of the crystallized Ge_{1−}_{x}Sn_{x} layers with the initial Sb content of 2 × 10^{20} cm^{−3} after PLA in water at different E values of 210 and 250 mJ/cm^{2} are shown in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b), respectively. In these figures, the grain boundary and the β-Sn region are also shown as a white line and a black pixel, respectively. It is found that a little amount of precipitated Sn exists at grain boundaries for E = 250 mJ/cm^{2}, suggesting that melting of the layer occurs. Distributions of the grain size were evaluated for various samples, as a function of E, as shown in Fig. 2(c). For E < 210 mJ/cm^{2}, the grains with random crystal orientation and size less than 10 nm were obtained (not shown here). As E increases, the grain size significantly increases at E = 230 mJ/cm^{2}, and then, the size becomes a constant value of ∼0.8 μm at E ≥ 250 mJ/cm^{2}. The E dependence of the grain size is consistent with our previous study on PLA in water of undoped 50-nm-thick a-Ge_{0.98}Sn_{0.02} layers on the 1-μm-thick SiO_{2} layer [16]. In addition, the range of E (≥250 mJ/cm^{2}), becoming a constant value of the grain size, is consistent with the range C discussed with Fig. 1. Consequently, we can say that full melting of Ge_{0.98}Sn_{0.02} layers down to the a-Ge_{0.98}Sn_{0.02}/SiO_{2} interface is a key to obtain a large grain, suggesting that crystal growth is initiated from the interface.
To analyze the activation ratio of Sb atoms in the Ge_{1−}_{x}Sn_{x} layers, hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES, hν = 7940 eV) measurements were carried out. Figure 3(a) shows the Sb 3d_{3/2} spectrum taken for the poly-Ge_{1−}_{x}Sn_{x}:Sb layer with the initial Sb content of 2 × 10^{20} cm^{−3} after PLA in water at E = 250 mJ/cm^{2}. The spectrum was deconvoluted into 3 components related to chemical bonding states of oxidized Sb (SbO_{y}), substitutional Sb (activated; Sb^{1+}), and isolated Sb (not activated; Sb^{0}); thus, the activation ratio of Sb atoms is given by I_{Sb^{1+}}/(I_{Sb^{1+}}+I_{Sb^{0}}), where I_{Sb}^{1+} and I_{Sb}^{0} are the area intensities of the Sb^{1+} and Sb^{0} peaks, respectively. They are summarized in Fig. 3(b) as a function of E, where activated Sb density is also shown on the right axis. It was confirmed that the Sb atoms were almost evenly distributed in the poly-Ge_{1−}_{x}Sn_{x} layer by the secondary ion mass spectrometry depth profile. Thus, the activated Sb density was roughly estimated from the ratios of the area intensity of Sb^{1+} to the area intensity of Ge 2p_{3/2}
where I, n, σ, and λ are the area intensity, atomic density, photoionization cross section, and photoelectron escape depth, respectively. The λ values of core-level photoelectrons under excitation with a hard X-ray whose energy was 7940 eV were set at 11.3 and 10.4 nm for Sb 3d_{3/2} and Ge 2p_{3/2}, respectively [17]; the n of Ge used in the calculation was 0.0734N_{D}, where N_{D} indicates Avogadro's number. It is found that the activation ratio of Sb is almost the same value of 64% without depending on E; the activated Sb density was also a constant value of 6.8 × 10^{19} cm^{−3}, which is much higher than the equilibrium solubility limit of Sb in Ge (1.2 × 10^{19} cm^{−3}) [10]. These results indicate that ultrashort-time annealing is effective to suppress a significant segregation of Sb atoms, and thus, a high activation ratio of the dopant could be obtained, as is the case of B-doped Si [18]. It is noted that the resulting activation ratio of 64% is at least 5 times larger than previous experimental results reported by Koike et_al, where the activation ratio of 13% was obtained for a poly-Ge:P layer with the initial P content of 1 × 10^{20} cm^{−3} crystallized by FLA [14]. The detailed study for the dopant dependence is now underway.
Electrical characteristics of poly-Ge_{1−}_{x}Sn_{x}:Sb layers were determined from the Hall effect measurement using a micro-Hall-bar structure [see inset of Fig. 4(a)]. N-type conduction was observed for all Ge_{1−}_{x}Sn_{x} layers with the initial Sb content of 2 × 10^{20} cm^{−3}. Figures 4(a) and 4(b) show the Hall electron mobility and the Hall electron density as a function of E. In Fig. 4(b), the electrically activated Sb densities shown in Fig. 3(b) are replotted for comparison. For E = 110 mJ/cm^{2}, the Hall electron mobility and the electron density show very low values of 2.7 cm^{2}/V s and 1.6× 10^{19} cm^{−3}, respectively. With increasing E, the Hall electron mobility and the electron density begin to increase, and then, they finally saturate at E ≥ 250 mJ/cm^{2}. The saturated Hall electron mobility and the electron density are 100 cm^{2}/V s and 6.4 × 10^{19} cm^{−3}, respectively. In addition, it is found that the Hall electron density was lower than the activated Sb density extracted by HAXPES at E < 250 mJ/cm^{2}; on the other hand, there is no discrepancy between them at E ≥ 250 mJ/cm^{2}. The boundary energy of 250 mJ/cm^{2} is consistent with the boundary between ranges B and C discussed for the grain size in Figs. 1 and 2; hence, we suggest that a trap of free electrons at the grain boundaries in Ge_{1−}_{x}Sn_{x} layers was the reason to decrease the free electron generated from the activated Sb atoms. We also examined the effects of the initial Sb content on the electrical characteristics; the experimental results indicate that the saturated electron density of 6.4 × 10^{19} cm^{−3} could be controlled and even increased by changing the initial Sb content; specifically, 1.1 × 10^{20} and 1.2 × 10^{20} cm^{−3} were obtained for samples with initial Sb contents of 4 × 10^{20} and 6 × 10^{20} cm^{−3}, respectively. Furthermore, in spite of the polycrystalline layer, the Hall electron densities are comparable to the counterparts of the single-crystalline Ge layers reported so far: 1.5 × 10^{20}, 2 × 10^{20}, and >1 × 10^{20} cm^{−3} were obtained for the studies on chemical vapor deposition [19], molecular beam epitaxy [20], and laser annealing after ion implantation [21], respectively. As a result, a minimum resistivity of 5.4 × 10^{−4} Ω cm could be obtained in this study, which is of the same order as the reported value (1.8 × 10^{−4} Ω cm) by Xu et_al [19]
Finally, the values for the Hall electron density and the electron mobility in various Ge-rich poly-Ge_{1−}_{x}Sn_{x}:Sb layers are plotted; the results are shown in Fig. 5, where experimental data of n-type poly-Ge layers reported by other groups [12,14] and n-type Si bulk [22] are also shown for comparison. The results in this study clearly demonstrate that the Hall electron density is better than the counterparts of n-type poly-Ge layers crystallized at a high-temperature process reported so far; in addition, our results of Ge-rich poly-Ge_{1−}_{x}Sn_{x}:Sb layers crystallized at a higher E around 250 mJ/cm^{2} are comparable to or better than the counterparts of n-type Si bulk. In this way, a high activation ratio of Sb atoms (64%) in Ge-rich poly-Ge_{1−}_{x}Sn_{x}:Sb layers has been achieved by using an ultraviolet laser irradiation in flowing water, resulting in simultaneous realization of the heavy n-type doping and the high electron mobility. This is quite informative for realizing sequential integration of poly-Ge_{1−}_{x}Sn_{x} CMOS circuits in 3D-ICs without degradation underlying circuits.
In conclusion, the effect of Sb doping on the crystallographic and electrical characteristics of poly-Ge_{1−}_{x}Sn_{x} layers on SiO_{2} crystallized by PLA in flowing water was investigated. EBSD and thermal simulation revealed that a large grained growth (0.8 μmϕ) could be realized for the case of fully melting down to the a-Ge_{0.98}Sn_{0.02}/SiO_{2} interface, resulting in not only a high activation ratio of Sb atoms over 60% in the polycrystals but also a high electron density around 10^{20} cm^{−3}. As a result, the Hall electron mobility in the n-type poly-Ge_{1−}_{x}Sn_{x} layers exceeds that in n-type Si bulk even in the region of a high electron density around 10^{20} cm^{−3}. We believe that this technique can be used to introduce dopants into not only Ge_{1−}_{x}Sn_{x} but also other group-IV crystals, such as pure Ge and SiC.
