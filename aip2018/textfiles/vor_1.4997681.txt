Doped ZrO_{2} for future lead free piezoelectric devices
The ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties of doped ZrO_{2} prepared by chemical solution deposition (CSD) are investigated. Doping with different elements such as Mg, In, La, and Y leads to a stabilization of the constricted hysteresis. As shown in a previous work, for the constricted hysteresis of ZrO_{2}, the piezoelectric response is significantly larger compared to ZrO_{2} with a normal hysteresis. The Mg doped ZrO_{2} shows a strong temperature and cycle stability. For the piezoelectric properties, a magnesium concentration of 7% shows the largest piezoelectric response with a piezoelectric coefficient of >10 pm/V, as well as the best cycle stability. Due to thicker films, which can be realized by the CSD technique, the shown doped ZrO_{2} films are a promising candidate for energy related applications such as piezoelectric energy harvesting as well as for microelectromechanical systems.
INTRODUCTION
Since the discovery of hafnia based ferroelectrics in 2011 by Boescke et_al [1], ferroelectricity for atomic layer deposition (ALD) and PVD prepared HfO_{2} was shown for several dopants [Y [2,3], Gd [4], Al [5], Sr [6], La [7], N, Sc, and Ge (Ref [8])]. In a previous work, it was shown that many further dopants are suitable to induce ferroelectricity in HfO_{2} [9]. In addition, a mixture of hafnium and zirconium oxide (HZO) also stabilizes the ferroelectric phase [10,11]. Besides atomic layer deposition (ALD), ferroelectricity was also observed for yttrium doped HfO_{2} prepared by sputter deposition [3], pulsed layer deposition [12], and chemical solution deposition (CSD) [13], indicating that the stabilization of the ferroelectric phase is independent of the layer preparation technique. The ferroelectricity in the hafnia and zirconia based ferroelectrics is attributed to the non-centrosymmetric orthorhombic phase with a Pca21 space group, which was recently found by Sang et_al [14] Nevertheless, the origin of the stabilization of the ferroelectric phase in these films has not been completely understood yet.
This new class of ferroelectrics was mainly considered as a suitable material for nonvolatile memory application [1,15,16]. Apart from the memory application, Park et_al also discussed the energy-related applications such as pyroelectric energy harvesting, electrocaloric cooling, and electrostatic energy storage [17–20].
For some applications such as electrocaloric cooling and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), thicker ferroelectric films are essential wherefore the chemical solution deposition (CSD) is particularly suitable.
Recently, we have shown that ferroelectricity appears in pure ZrO_{2} up to a film thickness of 390 nm with a relatively strong piezoelectric response in the pristine state with a constricted hysteresis. However, with ongoing cycling, the wake-up sets in which results in a widening of the hysteresis and a reduction of the piezoelectric response. In this work, we present our results on doped ZrO_{2}, whereby the doping suppresses the wake-up leading to a stabilization of the improved piezoelectric properties during cycling.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE
The doped ZrO_{2} films were fabricated by chemical solution deposition. The precursor solution was prepared by solving the desired amount of zirconium 2,4-pentandionate and the dopant (e.g., magnesium) 2,4-pentadionate in propionic acid and propionic acid anhydrite (5:3) at 140 °C for 6 h. The prepared solution with a concentration of 0.25 mol/l was spin coated on a 1 cm^{2} substrate covered with a 100 nm platinum bottom electrode with a (111) orientation. After each spin coating, a heating step was performed at 215 °C for five minutes. The spin coating process was repeated four and seven times to achieve the desired film thickness of 60 nm and 100 nm, respectively. For further information concerning the CSD technique, the reader is referred to the literature [21–23]. The final crystallization step was realized by a rapid thermal processing step at 800 °C for 90 s in an argon/oxygen atmosphere (1:1). The patterned 50 nm thick square shaped platinum top electrodes were deposited by a negative lift-of process at room temperature. A detailed description of the deposition process can be found elsewhere [23]. The polarization (P-V) measurements were carried out using an aixACCT Systems TF Analyzer 2000 at 1 kHz on device areas of 2.5 × 10^{−5} cm^{2}. The displacement measurements were performed with an aixACCT Systems aixDBLI double beam laser interferometer (DBLI) with the fast measurement method as described by Gerber et_al [24] at a frequency of 1 kHz and a device area of 4 × 10^{−4} cm^{2}. An average of at least 100 cycles was measured for the shown displacement results. For the gracing incidence (GI-XRD) measurements, a PANalytical XPert Pro with a wavelength of 0.154 nm was used. X-ray reflectivity (XRR) measurements were performed to determine the thickness of the deposited films.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Figure 1 shows the hysteresis and current curves for 60 nm thick 5% magnesium doped ZrO_{2} before and after wake-up cycling. The wake-up effect describes an increase of the remanent polarization during field cycling and is observed in HfO_{2} for different dopants [4,6,25], as well as for different deposition techniques [3,13,26] and for the Hf_{1-x}Zr_{x}O_{2} system [27]. Usually, a constricted hysteresis is present initially characterized by the two double peaks in the transient current response [28,29]. During regular wake-up cycling, the current peaks merge together leading to a normal hysteresis.
Such a wake-up behavior was found by several groups and is attributed to a cycling induced phase transition due to redistribution of oxygen vacancies [9,25,29–32]. The influence of oxygen vacancies on the electrical properties of dielectric ZrO_{2} and HfO_{2} was also studied in detail by Kumar et_al [33,34]
Figure 1 reveals that after the wake-up cycling, a strong constriction of the hysteresis is still visible with distinguished double current peaks. Several groups described this stable constricted hysteresis as a field induced phase transition from a paraelectric tetragonal/cubic to the ferroelectric orthorhombic Pca2_{1} phase [10,35–37]. In contrast to the cycling induced phase transition explaining the wake-up, the field induced phase transition is reversible. Lomenzo et_al [43] showed recently that doping of ferroelectric Hf_{0.5}Zr_{0.5}O_{2} with aluminum and silicon also leads to a stable constricted hysteresis.
The influence of the wake-up cycling on the transient current response for different magnesium concentrations is depicted in Fig. 2. A relatively strong wake-up can be found for the smallest Mg concentration of 2.2%. After 1000 cycles, the current peaks almost completely merged together. In a previous work, we have already shown that for pure ZrO_{2}, a full wake-up is achieved after 1000 cycles [38]. With increasing doping concentration, the wake up is strongly reduced, whereby for 7% doping, almost no change of the current response after cycling is visible. The ferroelectric switching current peaks vanish completely for a relatively high Mg concentration of 15%.
The Gi-XRD results in Fig. 3 reveal a non-ferroelectric cubic phase for all Mg concentrations. It should be mentioned that from simple Gi-XRD measurements, it is difficult to distinguish between the cubic and tetragonal phase. Further spectroscopic techniques such as Raman spectroscopy would be necessary to clearly distinguish between the two phases. Nevertheless, the exact high symmetric phase is not important for this work. The most relevant point from the XRD results is that obviously a high symmetric phase and no ferroelectric orthorhombic phase is present. For pure ZrO_{2} as well as for lower doping concentrations (2.2% and 3%), an irreversible phase transition from the cubic/tetragonal to the ferroelectric phase is achieved by field cycling. For higher doping concentrations, only a reversible field induced phase transition is present. For a magnesium concentration of 15%, the cubic/tetragonal phase is fully stabilized without any field induced phase transition.
The polarization and the corresponding current measurements for different magnesium concentrations at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 4. Almost no influence of the temperature is found. Only for lower doping concentrations at higher temperatures, it seems that the remanent polarization increases. However, in the current curves, no increase of the switching peaks is observed, whereas the current at higher electrical fields strongly increases with increasing temperatures. Since the polarization curve is calculated by integrating the measured current curve [28], the increased remanent polarization can be attributed to the increased leakage current.
Figure 5 illustrates the displacement, polarization, and current results for 100 nm thick magnesium doped ZrO_{2} for different doping concentrations. A larger layer thickness is chosen for a larger feedback of the displacement measurement. As for yttrium doped hafnium oxide shown in a previous work [13], no significant influence of the thickness can be found from the hysteresis and current curves. In a previous work, for pure ZrO_{2}, a strong degradation of the piezoelectric response as well as a strong increase of the leakage current was observed with ongoing cycling [38]. No such degradation is observed for the doped ZrO_{2} films. At 2.2% Mg doping, a small decrease of the piezoelectric response is measured. It should be mentioned that the wake-up after cycling is not as strong as shown in Fig. 2. This is because of triangle voltage sweeps that are applied to the layers shown in Fig. 5 instead of regular wake-up with rectangle pulses shown in Fig. 2. For 5% and 7% doping, almost no wake-up is present and therefore the piezoelectric response stays constant with a piezoelectric coefficient larger than 10 pm/V. For the piezoelectric d_{33} value, small signal measurements would be necessary. This is unfortunately not possible due to the large number of average cycles needed for recording the piezo response. With further increase of the doping concentration, the piezoelectric response decreases and an increase of leakage current is observed. The measured piezoelectric coefficient of doped ZrO_{2} is significantly larger compared to that of yttrium doped HfO_{2} [13]. This can be explained by the field induced phase transition from the cubic to the orthorhombic phase. An increased piezoelectric response around phase transition regions where different phases compete was also shown for perovskite based ferroelectrics [39,40]. Doping of ZrO_{2} leads to a stabilization of the phase transition region and therefore leads to a stable high piezoelectric response.
Boescke et_al first reported a stable constricted hysteresis for silicon doping [1]. The constricted hysteresis induced by silicon doping seems to show a different temperature behavior compared to the Hf_{1-x}Zr_{x}O_{2} system. For Si doping, with increasing temperature, the constriction gets stronger as reported by Boescke et_al and Hoffmann et_al [20,41], whereas for Hf_{0.2}Zr_{0.8}O_{2} (Ref [42]) and for doped ZrO_{2} (Fig. 4), only a weak temperature dependence is found. Therefore, it seems that there is a difference between the constricted hysteresis of Si doped HfO_{2} and the HZO/doped ZrO_{2} based system. The origin of this difference has not been understood yet.
The influence of different dopants on the polarization and current response for 5% doping after a regular wake-up is depicted in Fig. 6. Doping with indium shows a similar behavior as magnesium doping with a constricted hysteresis. For 5% lanthanum doping, the higher symmetrical phase is almost completely stabilized, and only for the positive voltages, small ferroelectric switching current peaks are visible. For 5% yttrium doping, however, a pure paraelectric response is measured. Reducing the doping concentration for yttrium does lead to a similar behavior as for magnesium (Fig. 7). In a previous work, it was shown that the dopant radius has a strong influence on the ferroelectric response for HfO_{2} [9]. Thereby, a significantly larger remanent polarization was measured for larger dopants. The dopant size seems to also play a role for ZrO_{2} whereby for larger dopants (La and Y), the paraelectric phase is already stabilized for 5% doping, whereas for the smaller dopants (Mg and In), a field induced phase transition can be achieved for larger doping concentrations up to 9%. The Gi-XRD data of the results shown in Figs. 5, 6, and 7 are not displayed in this work, since all films exhibit a strong cubic/tetragonal phase as for magnesium doping shown in Fig. 3. The dominant high symmetric phase was also found for doped hafnium oxide prepared by CSD in our previous studies [9,23]. In addition, no thickness dependence of the resulting phase was found earlier [13]. Therefore, it is difficult to discuss the correlation between the initial crystal phase and the electrical properties.
CONCLUSIONS
In summary, we have shown that doping of CSD prepared ZrO_{2} with several dopants leads to a stable constricted hysteresis. For lower Mg doping concentrations, an irreversible wake-up is observed. With increasing doping concentration, the wake-up is suppressed and only a reversible field induced phase transition is present. For 15% Mg doping, the high symmetric cubic/tetragonal phase is fully stabilized. Doping with larger dopants such as lanthanum or yttrium already fully stabilizes the cubic/tetragonal phase for a doping concentration of 5%. Therefore, doping with smaller dopants such as magnesium leads to a wider doping concentration window where the constricted hysteresis is observed. Displacement measurements with a double beam laser interferometer reveal a stable piezoelectric response with a piezoelectric coefficient of larger than 10 pm/V. This relatively high piezoelectric response and the possibility to deposit thick films by CSD makes doped ZrO_{2} suitable for future piezoelectric devices such as energy harvesters and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).
