Symmetric functions and wavefunctions of XXZ-type six-vertex models and elliptic Felderhof models by Izergin–Korepin analysis
We present a method to analyze the wavefunctions of six-vertex models by extending the Izergin–Korepin analysis originally developed for domain wall boundary partition functions. First, we apply the method to the case of the basic wavefunctions of the XXZ-type six-vertex model. By giving the Izergin–Korepin characterization of the wavefunctions, we show that these wavefunctions can be expressed as multiparameter deformations of the quantum group deformed Grothendieck polynomials. As a second example, we show that the Izergin–Korepin analysis is effective for analysis of the wavefunctions for a triangular boundary and present the explicit forms of the symmetric functions representing these wavefunctions. As a third example, we apply the method to the elliptic Felderhof model which is a face-type version and an elliptic extension of the trigonometric Felderhof model. We show that the wavefunctions can be expressed as one-parameter deformations of an elliptic analog of the Vandermonde determinant and elliptic symmetric functions.
I. INTRODUCTION
In statistical physics, the most fundamental and important objects are partition functions. Exact computation of partition functions has had a great impact in both mathematical physics and mathematics. In the field of integrable lattice models [1–4], exact computation of partition functions is an active area of research and has stimulated a variety of advances in representation theory and algebraic combinatorics. One of the most basic classes of partition functions is the class of domain wall boundary partition functions [5,6], which became famous in the field of algebraic combinatorics in the 1990s since their determinantal form (the Izergin–Korepin determinant) was realized to be a generalization of the generating function of the numbers of alternating-sign matrices [7–10]. Relations between domain wall boundary partition functions and classical integrable systems [11], orthogonal polynomials [12], and asymptotics in the thermodynamic limit [13–15] have also been investigated. Different extensions of domain wall boundary partition functions have been introduced, such as mixtures with a reflecting boundary. Studies of these have led to extensions of the generating functions of alternating-sign matrices [9,10,16–18].
In recent years, a more generic class of partition functions, which in this paper we call wavefunctions, have attracted attention. Domain wall boundary partition functions can be regarded as the simplest cases of such wavefunctions. Studies of the wavefunctions of various integrable models and various boundary conditions have led to the recognition that their explicit forms are nothing but symmetric functions such as the Schur, Hall–Littlewood, and Grothendieck polynomials and their deformations. One application of these integrable model realizations of symmetric functions has been to the discovery of various new algebraic combinatorial identities for symmetric functions that are substantial generalizations of the Cauchy, dual Cauchy, Littlewood, and Tokuyama formulae and the Littlewood–Richardson coefficients for Schur functions. There have been a large number of papers on this subject: see, for example, Refs [19–32], on symmetric functions as wavefunctions of the XXZ-type six-vertex model and the q-boson model, and Refs [33–38], on wavefunctions of the free-fermion model in an external field.
In this paper, we present a method to study the wavefunctions of six-vertex models, which are the most fundamental class of integrable lattice models. Many mathematical structures have been found by investigating six-vertex models, including quantum groups [39,40]. Various aspects of six-vertex models are reviewed in Refs [4] and  [41–43]. We present a systematic approach to the investigation of the wavefunctions of six-vertex models by extending the celebrated classical method of the Izergin–Korepin analysis. This was developed by Korepin [5] and Izergin [6] in the 1980s to investigate the explicit form of the domain wall boundary partition functions of the XXZ-type six-vertex model. The Izergin–Korepin determinant, which was applied in the 1990s to the problem of the enumeration of alternating-sign matrices, was found as a consequence of the Izergin–Korepin analysis. Tsuchiya [16] later showed that the Izergin–Korepin analysis can be used to study the domain wall boundary partition functions in the case of a reflecting end, and Wheeler [44] more recently extended the method to analyze another class of partition functions, known as scalar products. In this paper, we show that it is possible to extend the Izergin–Korepin analysis to wavefunctions and that the technique is effective in determining the explicit forms of the multivariable functions representing the wavefunctions. We illustrate the application of the Izergin–Korepin analysis to three cases.
We first apply the method to the most basic wavefunctions of the XXZ-type six-vertex model. The result for this basic example can be obtained by other methods; see, for example, Refs [25] and  [29]. We have already presented a proof [25] based on a combination of domain wall boundary partition functions and the matrix product method [45,46]. Here, we present a proof based on the Izergin–Korepin analysis as a first example since it provides a good illustration of our approach and will be helpful when we try to find explicit forms of the wavefunctions under other more complicated boundary conditions. The resulting symmetric functions representing the basic wavefunctions can be regarded as a quantum group deformation of the Grothendieck polynomials of the Grassmannian variety [47–52]. This is because, at the point q = 0, the six-vertex model reduces to the five-vertex model, where the basic wavefunctions become the Grothendieck polynomials [22,24], and the first example treated in this paper concerns the basic wavefunctions constructed from an L-operator that is a quantum group deformation of the L-operator whose basic wavefunctions produce the Grothendieck polynomials. We remark that what we call wavefunctions in this paper are actually projections of the so-called off-shell Bethe vector [53] to some simple states labeled by the configurations of down spins. The “off-shell” in “off-shell Bethe vector” means that the set of constraints known as the Bethe ansatz equations are not imposed on the spectral parameters. To produce functions from the off-shell Bethe vector, one has to take the inner product between this vector and some state vectors labeled by the configurations of the down-spin states. Symmetric functions consist of symmetric variables and are often labeled by Young diagrams. Symmetric variables come from the off-shell Bethe vector. On the other hand, the configurations of the down spins labeling the state vectors correspond to the Young diagrams labeling the Grothendieck polynomials for the case of the five-vertex model, for example.
As a second example, we introduce and study an analog of wavefunctions. We investigate wavefunctions for a triangular boundary. The main motivation for introducing this object is that similar combinatorial objects, known as non-intersecting lattice paths and excited Young diagrams [52,54–57], appear in the field of algebraic combinatorics and Schubert calculus. For example, there is a class of non-intersecting lattice paths whose starting points are fixed while their end points are free, and the Schur Q- and P-functions can be described combinatorially using these objects. By translating these combinatorial objects into the language of integrable lattice models, one finds that they can be regarded as wavefunctions of five-vertex models for a triangular boundary. From the point of view of quantum integrability, it is natural to ask why we do not use the six-vertex models as bulk weights. In this paper, we introduce an analog of the wavefunctions for a triangular boundary by using the U_{q}(sl_{2}) R-matrix as a bulk weight. At the triangular boundary, we use a K-matrix satisfying the reflection equation [58]. There are several types of K-matrix: the full K-matrix, the diagonal K-matrix, and the triangular K-matrix. In this paper, we use the triangular K-matrix as a boundary weight for the wavefunctions. Note that there are two meanings of the word “triangular” in this paper. The first meaning is that the wavefunctions are triangular in shape at one boundary. The second meaning is that we use the triangular K-matrix at that boundary. See, for example, Refs [59–63], which investigate the algebraic Bethe ansatz and q-vertex operator approach to physical quantities of integrable models using the triangular K-matrix at the boundary. We apply the Izergin–Korepin analysis to the wavefunctions for a triangular boundary and determine the explicit forms of the symmetric functions representing these wavefunctions. The resulting symmetric functions can be expressed as sums over symmetric groups and resemble the (K-theoretic) Schur Q- and P-functions, although the expressions are much more complicated in this case.
As a third example, we show that the Izergin–Korepin analysis is also effective for systematic computation of the wavefunctions of other integrable models. We shall study the basic wavefunctions of the elliptic Felderhof model, and so we first describe in some detail the background of this model and previous studies of its trigonometric version. When we say “six-vertex model,” we generally mean the integrable lattice model constructed from the local quantum group U_{q}(sl_{2}) R-matrix of the Drinfeld–Jimbo representation [39,40]. However, there is actually another class of integrable six-vertex models for which interesting results have been obtained. Bump, Brubaker, and Friedberg [33] showed that the wavefunctions give an integrable model realization of the Tokuyama formula for the Schur functions [64]. Pioneering work has also been done on variations of the Tokuyama formula [17,18,65], which is a one-parameter deformation of the Weyl character formula for the Schur functions. Bump, Brubaker, and Friedberg showed that the wavefunctions are given as products of a one-parameter deformation of the Vandermonde determinant and the Schur functions, and this correspondence is the key result for this integrable model realization of the Tokuyama formula. This fundamental result led to a search for generalizations and variations of a Tokuyama-type formula for various types of symmetric functions [34–38,57,66–68]. Among the latest topics to be investigated is metaplectic ice, which was explicitly constructed recently by Brubaker et_al [67], by twisting higher rank Perk–Schultz models.
The free-fermionic six-vertex model investigated by Bump et_al [33] and its extension studied by Bump et_al [37] can be given two interpretations. One is as a special case of the Perk–Schultz model [69], whose underlying mathematical structure is a quantum superalgebra [70]. The other interpretation is as a variant of the Felderhof free-fermion model [71], whose R-matrix is related to the roots-of-unity finite-dimensional highest-weight representations of quantum groups [72,73]. Using the Izergin–Korepin analysis, Zhao and Zhang [74] and Foda et_al [75] showed the existence of the factorization phenomenon for the domain wall boundary partition functions of the Perk–Schultz and Felderhof free-fermion models, even for higher-rank models. Determinant representations of the correlation functions of these models have also been obtained [76].
Elliptic extensions of both the Perk–Schultz model and the Felderhof model have also been constructed. For example, an elliptic extension of the Perk–Schultz model was introduced independently by Okado [77] and Deguchi-Martin [78]. The factorization phenomenon for the domain wall boundary partition functions of the Okado–Deguchi–Martin model was shown to occur by Foda, Wheeler, and Zuparic [79,80]. We have recently introduced and investigated the wavefunctions of the Okado–Deguchi–Martin model and have shown that the wavefunctions can be expressed as products of elliptic factors and elliptic Schur-type functions [81].
A trigonometric face-type version of the Felderhof model was first introduced by Deguchi and Akutsu [73]. Replacing the trigonometric functions of the weights in the face-type trigonometric Felderhof model by theta functions in an appropriate way, Foda et_al [79] constructed an elliptic Felderhof model. The factorization phenomenon was also shown to occur for the domain wall boundary partition functions of the elliptic Felderhof model [79,82]. The product of some of the elliptic factors appearing in the domain wall boundary partition functions can be viewed as a one-parameter deformation of an elliptic analog of the Vandermonde determinant. The free parameter of the elliptic Felderhof model in the auxiliary space can be seen to play the role of a deformation parameter of the elliptic Vandermonde determinant. This property of the domain wall boundary partition functions motivates us to introduce and study the wavefunctions of the elliptic Felderhof model, since, for the trigonometric model, it was shown by Bump, Brubaker, and Friedberg and by Bump, McNamara, and Nakasuji that this free parameter coming from the auxiliary space plays the role of deforming the Vandermonde determinant part of the wavefunctions, which is important in providing an exact correspondence between the wavefunctions and the Tokuyama formula. Such a free parameter also occurs in the case of the elliptic Felderhof model, whereas it is absent in the Okado–Deguchi–Martin model (the elliptic Perk–Schultz model).
The properties of this class of integrable six-vertex models and their elliptic extensions described above provide us with our motivation for studying the wavefunctions of the elliptic Felderhof model, which we treat as the third example in this paper. We introduce the elliptic wavefunctions and perform a Izergin–Korepin analysis on them. We then present certain multivariable elliptic functions that satisfy all the properties required for the Izergin–Korepin characterization; i.e., they are explicit representations for the wavefunctions. The multivariable elliptic functions are given explicitly as products of a one-parameter deformation of the elliptic Vandermonde determinant and elliptic Schur-type symmetric functions. This result can be regarded as an elliptic analog of the correspondence established by Bump, Brubaker, and Friedberg [33] and by Bump, McNamara, and Nakasuji [37]. The three examples treated in this paper show that the Izergin–Korepin analysis is a universal method that can be used to study the wavefunctions of various classes of integrable six-vertex models under various boundary conditions.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we illustrate the Izergin–Korepin analysis of the basic wavefunctions of the six-vertex model constructed from the U_{q}(sl_{2})L-operator and show that the explicit forms of the symmetric functions representing the basic wavefunctions are multiparameter extensions of the quantum group deformation of the Grothendieck polynomials. In Sec. III, we introduce an analog of the wavefunctions for a triangular boundary using the U_{q}(sl_{2}) R-matrix as bulk pieces and the corresponding triangular K-matrix as boundary pieces at the triangular boundary. We perform an Izergin–Korepin analysis on the wavefunctions and show that the explicit forms are given as symmetric functions that resemble but are much more complicated than the (K-theoretic) Schur Q- and P-functions. In Sec. IV, we study the basic wavefunctions of the elliptic Felderhof model. From an elliptic Izergin–Korepin analysis, we show that the explicit representations of the wavefunctions are certain multivariable elliptic functions that are products of a one-parameter deformation of the elliptic Vandermonde determinant and elliptic Schur-type symmetric functions. Section V is devoted to our conclusions.
II. XXZ-TYPE SIX-VERTEX MODEL
In this section, we perform an Izergin–Korepin analysis on the basic wavefunctions of the XXZ-type six-vertex model. We then present the symmetric functions representing the basic wavefunctions and show that they satisfy all the properties of the wavefunctions extracted from the Izergin–Korepin analysis.
A. U_{q}(sl_{2}) R-matrix and L-operator
In this subsection, we introduce the U_{q}(sl_{2}) R-matrix and the L-operator that will be used to construct the wavefunctions in this section and Secs. III and IV.
The U_{q}(sl_{2}) R-matrix is the matrix [39,40]
acting on the tensor product W_{a} ⊗ W_{b} of the complex two-dimensional space W_{a}. This matrix satisfies the Yang–Baxter relation
acting on W_{a} ⊗ W_{b} ⊗ W_{c}.
The L-operator satisfying the RLL-type Yang–Baxter relation
acting on W_{a}⊗W_{b}⊗F_{j}, gives a wider class of integrable models, including the R-matrix as a special case. Taking the R-matrix as in (2.1) and taking the quantum space F_{j} to be a complex two-dimensional space, one can show that the matrix
acting on the tensor product W_{a}⊗F_{j}, is the most generic L-operator [26] (Fig. 1). Here, a, b, c, d, e, and f are constant parameters (they do not depend on the spectral parameter u) and must obey the relations
If one assumes q ≠ 1, then the relations (2.5) further reduce to
The L-operator (2.4) together with the U_{q}(sl_{2}) R-matrix (2.1) satisfies the RLL-type Yang–Baxter relation (2.3). Equations (2.4) and (2.3) include the U_{q}(sl_{2}) R-matrix (2.1) and the RRR-type Yang–Baxter relation (2.2) as a special case with a = 1, b = −q, c = 1, d = 1, e = 1, and f = −1. We shall often abbreviate L_{aj}(u, w, a, b, c, d, e, f) as L_{aj}(u, w) for simplicity.
If we denote the orthonormal basis of W_{a} and its dual by {|0⟩_{a}, |1⟩_{a}} and {_{a}⟨0|, _{a}⟨1|} and the orthonormal basis of F_{j} and its dual by {|0⟩_{j}, |1⟩_{j}} and {_{j}⟨0|, _{j}⟨1|}, then the matrix elements of the L-operator can be written as _{a}⟨γ|_{j}⟨δ|L_{aj}(u, w)|α⟩_{a}|β⟩_{j}. In this notation, the matrix elements of the L-operator (2.4) are given explicitly by
All other matrix elements are identically zero.
The L-operators originally come from statistical physics, from the point of view of which |0 or its dual 0| can be regarded as a spin-up state and |1 or its dual 1| as a spin-down state. We shall sometimes use the terms up-spin states (up spins) and down-spin states (down spins) to describe states constructed from |0, 0|, |1, and 1| since this is convenient for the description of the states.
For later convenience, we also define the Pauli spin operators σ^{+} and σ^{−} as operators acting on the (dual) orthonormal basis as
B. Basic wavefunctions
In this subsection, we construct the basic wavefunctions from the L-operator L(u, w) (2.4). We first construct the monodromy matrix T_{a}(u|w_{1}, …, w_{N}) from the L-operator as
Here, L_{aj}(u,w_{j})=L_{aN}(u,w_{j},a_{j},b_{j},c_{j},d_{j},e_{j},f_{j}), j = 1, …, N, is the L-operator acting on W_{a}⊗F_{j}, where a_{j}, b_{j}, c_{j}, d_{j}, e_{j}, and f_{j} satisfy
for each j.
The B-operator, which is a matrix element of the monodromy matrix T_{a}(u|w_{1}, …, w_{N}),
is an 2^{N} × 2^{N} matrix acting on the tensor product of the quantum spaces F_{1}⊗⋯⊗F_{N} and has the role of creating down spins in the quantum spaces F_{1}⊗⋯⊗F_{N}. We next introduce the state vector |Φ_{N,n}(u_{1},…,u_{n}|w_{1},…,w_{N})∈F_{1}⊗⋯⊗F_{N} using the B-operator as
where |Ω{N}≔|0{1}⊗⋯⊗|0{N}∈F_{1}⊗⋯⊗F_{N} (_{N}Ω|≔_{1}0|⊗⋯⊗_{N}0|∈F1*⊗⋯⊗FN*) is the (dual) vacuum state in the tensor product of quantum spaces. The state vector (2.18) is sometimes called the off-shell Bethe vector. If one imposes certain constraints on the spectral parameters {u_{j}}, called the Bethe ansatz equations, the state vector (2.18) becomes the eigenvectors (Bethe vectors) of the transfer matrix A(u|w_{1}, …, w_{N}) + D(u|w_{1}, …, w_{N}), which is a generating function of operators, including the Hamiltonian.
The L-operator L_{aj}(u, w) of the six-vertex model satisfies the so-called ice rule,
From this ice rule, one can see that each B-operator creates one down spin in the quantum spaces. From this and the fact that the state vector (2.18) is constructed from N layers of the B-operators acting on the vacuum state |Ω⟩_{N}, one sees that the state vector (2.18) is an N-down-spin state. To construct a nonvanishing inner product, we introduce the dual n-down-spin state
composed of states labeled by the configurations of down spins, 1 ≤ x_{1} < x_{2} < ⋯ < x_{n} ≤ N.
The basic wavefunctions W_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|w_{1}, …, w_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}) are defined as inner products of the state vector |Φ_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|w_{1}, …, w_{N})⟩ and the n-down-spin state ⟨x_{1} ⋯ x_{n}|,
See Fig. 2 for a pictorial description of (2.20).
In quantum integrable models, we usually call (2.18) the (off-shell Bethe) wavevectors, and (2.20) is actually a projection of the wavevectors on some simple states. For simplicity, we shall call (2.20) wavefunctions rather than projected wavefunctions, although the latter is more appropriate for these objects in the original sense.
C. Izergin–Korepin analysis
In this subsection, we determine the properties of the basic wavefunctions
by performing an Izergin–Korepin analysis.
Proposition 2.1. The wavefunctions W_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|w_{1}, …, w_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}) possess the following properties:
(1) W_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|w_{1}, …, w_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}) are polynomials of degree n − 1 inw_{N}if x_{n} = N and degree n if x_{n} ≠ N.
(2) W_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|w_{1}, …, w_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}) are symmetric with respect to u_{j}, j = 1, …, n.
(3) The following recursion relations among the wavefunctions hold if x_{n} = N:
If x_{n} ≠ N, the following factorizations hold for the wavefunctions:
(4) The following expression holds for the case n = 1, x_{1} = N:
Proof. Most of these properties can be proved in the same way by proving similar statements on the domain wall boundary partition functions using the Izergin–Korepin analysis.We first show properties (1) and (3) for the case x_{n} = N. We introduce the following vertical transfer matrix:
Using this matrix, the wavefunctions can be rewritten as
with
We use the completeness relation in one down-spin sector,
with
and decompose (2.25) as follows:
In each summand of this decomposition, the dependence on w_{N} comes from
The factors f_{j}(w_{N}) can be explicitly calculated easily from the graphical description, and we find
From the degree of f_{j}(w_{N}), which can be easily seen from its expression (2.28), we conclude that the wavefunctions W_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|w_{1}, …, w_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n−1}, N) are polynomials of degree n − 1 in w_{N}.We continue the argument to prove property (3) for the case x_{n} = N from the expression (2.27). From (2.28), we can see that if we substitute w_{N}=−bN−1a_{N}u_{n}, then all of the f_{j}(w_{N}) except f_{1}(w_{N}) vanish. Hence, we find that the decomposition of the basic wavefunctions W_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|w_{1}, …, w_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n−1}, N), (2.27), evaluated at w_{N}=−bN−1a_{N}u_{n} reduces to
Using the ice rule for the L-operator, we can further simplify the term
as follows:
Combining (2.29) and (2.30), we get the relation
and hence property (3) for the case x_{n} = N is proved.Properties (1) and (3) for the case x_{n} ≠ N can be proved in a much simpler way. Using the ice rule for the L-operator, we easily find the factorization
and the proof for the case x_{n} ≠ N is complete.Property (2) can be shown by the so-called railroad argument using the Yang–Baxter relation. Equivalently, it follows from the commutativity of the B-matrix,
This commutativity follows from writing down a matrix element of the intertwining relation between the monodromy matrices
which follows from the repeated use of the RLL relation (2.3).What remains to show is property (4). It is easy to calculate from the graphical representation of W_{N,1}(u|w_{1}, …, w_{N}|N) that all the L-operators from which the wavefunctions are constructed are frozen, and we can easily check that
We now explain the Izergin–Korepin analysis performed in this subsection. The idea of this analysis is to relate the wavefunctions to smaller ones by using the following property of the polynomials: if P(y) and Q(y) are polynomials of degree n − 1 in y and if these polynomials match at n distinct points, then the two polynomials are exactly the same. We view the wavefunctions W_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|w_{1}, …, w_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}) as polynomials in a single variable w_{N}. Property (1) in Proposition 2.1 means that when x_{n} = N, the wavefunctions W_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|w_{1}, …, w_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}) are polynomials of degree n − 1 in w_{N}. This and the general property of the polynomials described above imply that if one is able to relate the evaluations of the wavefunctions at n distinct points in w_{N} with smaller wavefunctions and if one can find the exact functions satisfying the same recursion, then these are exactly those representing the wavefunctions. The explicit forms of the functions will be presented in Subsection II D, and we have derived relations between wavefunctions of different sizes in this subsection. When x_{n} = N, one can evaluate the wavefunctions at the n points w_{N}=−bN−1aN−1u_{j}, j = 1, …, n, and connect them with smaller wavefunctions. The evaluation at w_{N}=−bN−1aN−1u_{n} can be calculated easily, and the wavefunctions essentially reduce to the smaller wavefunctions W_{N−1,n−1}(u_{1}, …, u_{n−1}|w_{1}, …, w_{N−1}|x_{1}, …, x_{n−1}) by the relation (2.21) of property (3). The evaluations at the other (n − 1) points w_{N}=−bN−1aN−1u_{j}, j = 1, …, n − 1, can be obtained from the evaluation at w_{N}=−bN−1aN−1u_{n} using property (2), which states that the wavefunctions are symmetric with respect to the parameters {u_{j}}.We also have to deal with the other possible case x_{n} ≠ N. We do not have to consider a case like this when dealing with domain wall boundary partition functions. However, this case does appear when we deal with general wavefunctions. It is much easier to connect the wavefunctions in this case. The factorization (2.22) holds, and the smaller wavefunctions connected in this case are W_{N−1,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|w_{1}, …, w_{N−1}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}).The wavefunctions of the six-vertex model of different sizes can be connected in both cases x_{n} = N and x_{n} ≠ N as described above. Repeating this process, we have chains of recursion relations between the wavefunctions. We also need property (4) in Proposition 2.1 to ensure uniqueness since this property corresponds to the initial condition of the recursion relations. The initial condition depends on the parameters n and N and on the configurations of the down spins x_{1}, …, x_{n} of the top wavefunctions. For example, when the top wavefunction is W_{7,3}(u_{1}, u_{2}, u_{3}|w_{1}, w_{2}, w_{3}, w_{4}, w_{5}, w_{6}, w_{7}|4, 5, 7), the sequence of wavefunctions where the recursion relations exist is
so the initial wavefunction is W_{4,1}(u_{1}|w_{1}, w_{2}, w_{3}, w_{4}|4) in this case. If one can find explicit functions satisfying all the properties listed in Proposition 2.1, then they are nothing other than those representing the wavefunctions. This is presented in Subsection II D.
D. Symmetric functions
In this subsection, we first define some symmetric functions.
Definition 2.2. We define symmetric functions F_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|w_{1}, …, w_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}) that depend on the symmetric variables u_{1}, …, u_{n}, complex parameters w_{1}, …, w_{N}, and integers x_{1}, …, x_{n} satisfying 1 ≤ x_{1} < ⋯ < x_{n} ≤ N,
We make the following comment about the symmetric functions F_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|w_{1}, …, w_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}). If one takes the homogeneous limit w_{j} = 1, j = 1, …, N and specializes to a_{j} = 1, b_{j} = qβ, c_{j} = 1, d_{j} = 1, e_{j} = −β^{−1}, f_{j} = −1, and j = 1, …, N, then the symmetric functions (2.37) become
If one furthermore sets the parameter q of the quantum group to q = 0, then the polynomials in (2.38) essentially become the Grothendieck polynomials
Here, G_{λ}(z; β) are the β-Grothendieck polynomials of the type A Grassmannian variety [47–52], which are known to have the determinantal form
In the correspondence (2.39), the symmetric variables z = {z_{1}, …, z_{n}} for the Grothendieck polynomials G_{λ}(z; β) and the spectral parameters u_{1}, …, u_{n} of the symmetric functions F_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|1, …, 1|x_{1}, …, x_{n})|_{q=0} are related by z_{j}=−β^{−1}−uj−1, j = 1, …, n. Also, the Young diagrams λ=(λ_{1},λ_{2},…,λ_{n})∈Z^{n} (N − n ≥ λ_{1} ≥ λ_{2} ≥ ⋯ ≥ λ_{n} ≥ 0) in G_{λ}(z; β) and the sequence of integers x_{1}, …, x_{n} satisfying 1 ≤ x_{1} < ⋯ < x_{n} ≤ N in F_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|1, …, 1|x_{1}, …, x_{n})|_{q=0} are connected by the translation rule λ_{j} = x_{n−j+1} − n + j − 1, j = 1, …, n.We have the following correspondence between the basic wavefunctions of the XXZ-type six-vertex model and the symmetric functions F_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|w_{1}, …, w_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}):
Theorem 2.3. The basic wavefunctions of the XXZ-type six-vertex model can be explicitly expressed as symmetric functions,
Proof. We prove this theorem by showing that the symmetric functions in (2.37) satisfy all four properties in Proposition 2.1. The proof goes along the same lines as the case with a triangular boundary in Sec. III, but is much simpler.To show property (1), we first note that the factor ∏j=1n∏k=x_{j}+1N(a_{k}u_{σ(j)}+b_{k}w_{k}) in F_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|w_{1}, …, w_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}) is a polynomial of degree n − 1 in w_{N} if x_{n} = N and of degree n if x_{n} ≠ N. We can also immediately see that the dependence on w_{N} comes only from this factor, and hence property (1) is proved.It is also easy to see that F_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|w_{1}, …, w_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}) are symmetric with respect to u_{j}, j = 1, …, n, since the sum appearing in the definition is over all permutations of the variables u_{j}, j = 1, …, n.Next we show property (3). We first prove that F_{N,n}({u}_{n}|w_{1}, …, w_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}) satisfy (2.21) for the case x_{n} = N. In this case, we first note that the factor
in each summand essentially becomes
Concentrating on the factor ∏j=1n−1(a_{N}u_{σ(j)}+b_{N}w_{N}) from (2.43), we find, on substituting w_{N}=−bN−1a_{N}u_{n}, that this factor vanishes unless σ satisfies σ(n) = n. Therefore, only the summands satisfying σ(n) = n in (2.37) survive after the substitution w_{N}=−bN−1a_{N}u_{n}. Keeping this in mind, we rewrite F_{N,n}({u}_{n}|w_{1}, …, w_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}) evaluated at w_{N}=−bN−1a_{N}u_{n} by using the symmetric group S_{n−1}, where every σ′ ∈ S_{n−1} satisfies {σ′(1), …, σ′(n − 1)} = {1, …, n − 1}, as follows:
We easily note that the factors ∏k=1N−1(e_{k}u_{n}+f_{k}w_{k}) and (1 − q)c_{N}u_{n} in the sum are independent of the permutation Sn−1′. We also find that the factor ∏j=1n−1qu_{σ^{′}(j)}−u_{n}u_{σ^{′}(j)}−u_{n}∏j=1n−1a_{N}(u_{σ^{′}(j)}−u_{n}) can be simplified as
Hence, (2.44) can be rewritten as
Noting that
we find that (2.46) is nothing but the following recursion relation for the symmetric functions F_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|w_{1}, …, w_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}):
which is exactly the same recursion relation that must be satisfied by the basic wavefunctions W_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|w_{1}, …, w_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}). Hence, property (3) is proved for the case x_{n} = N.The proof in the case x_{n} ≠ N proceeds in a similar but much simpler way. Rewriting F_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|w_{1}, …, w_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}) as
and noting that
we can take this factor out of the sum in (2.49) to get
which is also exactly the same recursion relation that must be satisfied by the basic wavefunctions F_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|w_{1}, …, w_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}) for the case x_{n} ≠ N.It is trivial to check from its definition that F_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|w_{1}, …, w_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}) satisfies F_{N,1}(u|w_{1},…,w_{N}|N)=(1−q)c_{N}u∏k=1N−1(e_{k}u+f_{k}w_{k}), and hence property (4) is proved.Since we have proved that the symmetric functions F_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|w_{1}, …, w_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}) satisfy all of properties (1)–(4) in Proposition 2.1, we conclude that they are the explicit forms of the basic wavefunctions,
III. XXZ-TYPE SIX-VERTEX MODEL FOR A TRIANGULAR BOUNDARY
In this section, we introduce and study a class of analogs of wavefunctions for a triangular boundary. We apply the Izergin–Korepin analysis and then present the explicit form of the symmetric functions representing the wavefunctions, whose expressions resemble but are much more complicated than the (K-theoretic) Schur Q- and P-functions. This example illustrates that the Izergin–Korepin analysis is also effective for dealing with wavefunctions under more complicated boundary conditions.
A. Analogs of wavefunctions
In this section, we introduce a class of analogs of wavefunctions of the six-vertex model for a triangular boundary. For the bulk pieces of the wavefunctions, we use the U_{q}(sl_{2}) R-matrix R(u, w) (2.1) (Fig. 3) satisfying the Yang–Baxter relation (2.2) (Fig. 4).
The wavefunctions for a triangular boundary also use the following triangular K-matrix acting on W_{a} as boundary pieces (see Fig. 5):
where A and B are arbitrary complex parameters. The matrix elements of the K-matrix are given explicitly by
The K-matrix (3.1) together with the R-matrix (2.1) satisfies the relation
which is called the reflection equation or the boundary Yang–Baxter equation [58] (Fig. 6). The reflection equation ensures integrability at the boundary, and we use this particular K-matrix as local pieces of the wavefunctions at the boundary. Note that (3.1) can be regarded as a specialization of the full K-matrix that satisfies the reflection equation (3.6).
To formulate the wavefunctions for a triangular boundary, we introduce the tensor product of the Fock spaces: W_{−n} ⊗ ⋯ ⊗ W_{−1} ⊗ W_{1} ⊗ ⋯ ⊗ W_{N}. Note that we do not introduce a Fock space W_{0}.
Using the R-matrix and the K-matrix, we next define a monodromy matrix T_{j}(u_{1}, …, u_{j}|w_{1}, …, w_{N}), j = 1, …, n, as
which acts on W_{−j} ⊗ ⋯ ⊗ W_{−1} ⊗ W_{1} ⊗ ⋯ ⊗ W_{N}. See Fig. 7 for a pictorial depiction of (3.7). Using this monodromy matrix, we construct a state vector |Ψ_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|w_{1}, …, w_{N})⟩ ∈ W_{1} ⊗ ⋯ ⊗ W_{N} as follows:
where the states ⟨0^{n}| and |Ω⟩_{n+N} are defined as
The state vector (3.8) is an analog of the off-shell Bethe vector. We remark that there is a big difference between the properties of the state vector (3.8) and the basic off-shell Bethe vector (2.18) in Sec. II. The basic off-shell Bethe vector of the six-vertex model (and its degeneration to the five-vertex model) is constructed from multiple actions of the so-called B-operators on the vacuum state, with one B-operator always creating one down spin, and hence the basic off-shell Bethe vector constructed from n layers of B-operators gives an n-down-spin state. However, the state vector (3.8) constructed from n layers T_{j}(u_{1}, …, u_{j}|w_{1}, …, w_{N}), j = 1, …, n, does not always give an n-down-spin state.
Keeping this in mind, let us now introduce the wavefunctions for a triangular boundary. We first introduce the dual spin state
which is composed of states labeled by the configurations of down spins 1 ≤ x_{1} < x_{2} < ⋯ < x_{m} ≤ N. Here Wa* means the dual space of W_{a}.
The wavefunctions for a triangular boundary, W_{N,n,m}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|w_{1}, …, w_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{m}), are defined as the inner products of |Ψ_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|w_{1}, …, w_{N})⟩ and the dual m-down-spin states ⟨x_{1} ⋯ x_{m}|,
The wavefunctions W_{N,n,m}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|w_{1}, …, w_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{m}) are symmetric with respect to the spectral parameters u_{1}, …, u_{n}, which can be shown by the so-called railroad argument using the Yang–Baxter relation and the reflection equation; hence, we sometimes abbreviate W_{N,n,m}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|w_{1}, …, w_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{m}) as W_{N,n,m}({u}_{n}|w_{1}, …, w_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{m}), where {u}_{n} means {u_{1}, …, u_{n}} as a set. See Fig. 8 for a graphical description of the wavefunctions W_{N,n,m}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|w_{1}, …, w_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{m}).
B. Izergin–Korepin analysis
In this subsection, we perform a Izergin–Korepin analysis [5,6] on the wavefunctions of the elliptic Felderhof model, W_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|v_{1}, …, v_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}|h).
Proposition 4.2. The wavefunctions W_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|v_{1}, …, v_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}|h) satisfy the following properties:
(1) When x_{n}satisfies x_{n} = N, the wavefunctions W_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|v_{1}, …, v_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}|h) are elliptic polynomials of v_{N}in Θ_{n}(χ).
(2) The wavefunctions W_{N,n}(u_{σ(1)}, …, u_{σ(n)}|v_{1}, …, v_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}|h) with the ordering of the spectral parameters permuted as u_{σ(1)}, …, u_{σ(n)}, σ ∈ S_{n}, are related to the original wavefunctions W_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|v_{1}, …, v_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}|h) by
(3) If x_{n} = N, the following recursion relations among the wavefunctions hold:
If x_{n} ≠ N, the following factorizations hold for the wavefunctions:
(4) The following evaluation holds for the case n = 1, x_{1} = N:
Proof. Properties (1)–(3) for the case x_{n} = N can be proved essentially in the standard way as described in Refs [79] and  [82].We first show properties (1) and (3) for the case x_{n} = N. We introduce the following vertical transfer matrix:
Using this matrix, the wavefunctions can be rewritten as
with
We use the completeness relation in one up-spin sector,
with
and decompose (4.27) as
In each summand of the decomposition (4.29), the dependence on v_{N} comes from the factors ⟨1^{n−j}01^{j−1}|_{N}⟨1|TNn(vN|u1,…,un)|1⟩{⊗n}|0⟩{N}=:g_{j}(v_{N}). The factors g_{j}(v_{N}) can be explicitly calculated easily from the graphical description, and we find
From the explicit form (4.30), concentrating on the factors depending on v_{N} and recalling the quasiperiodicities of the theta functions (4.3) and (4.4), we can calculate the quasiperiodicities of g_{j}(v_{N}),
We find that the wavefunctions W_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|v_{1}, …, v_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n−1}, N|h) also satisfy the same quasiperiodicities as functions of v_{N} since the quasiperiodicities for g_{j}(v_{N})s, which appear when decomposing the wavefunctions (4.29), (4.31), and (4.32), do not depend on j,
If we denote W_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|v_{1}, …, v_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n−1}, N|h) by ϕ(v_{N}) and τ = −i log(q)/π, then the quasiperiodicities (4.33) and (4.34) can be rewritten as
Comparing with the quasiperiodicities (4.5) and (4.6), we can conclude that the wavefunctions W_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|v_{1}, …, v_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n−1}, N|h) are elliptic polynomials of v_{N} in Θ_{n}(χ) with characters
Next, we prove property (3) for the case x_{n} = N; i.e., we show the recursion relation among the wavefunctions W_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|v_{1}, …, v_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}|h) (4.23). We continue the calculation from (4.29). If we set v_{N} = u_{n} + p − q_{N}, then we find from (4.30) that only the term corresponding to j = 1 of the sum in (4.29) survives, and we have
Next, using the ice rule for the dynamical L-operator, we can further simplify the last part in (4.37) as follows:
Combining (4.37) and (4.38), we have
which shows property (3) for the case x_{n} = N.Property (3) for the case x_{n} ≠ N can be shown much more simply. Using the ice rule for the dynamical L-operator, we can easily find the factorization as follows:
This shows property (3) for the case x_{n} ≠ N.Property (2) can also be shown in a standard way. We start from a special case of the Yang–Baxter relation (4.14) written in the form
Using (4.41) repeatedly, we obtain the intertwining relation between the monodromy matrices,
The commutation relation between the B-operators can be obtained as a matrix element of the intertwining relation (4.42),
Using the commutation relations (4.43) and recalling the definition of the wavefunctions (4.21), we immediately get
Equation (4.22) can be obtained by using the relation (4.44) repeatedly.The final property (4) can be proved in the same way as property (3). We can immediately see that all the dynamical R-matrices get frozen. Multiplying all the corresponding matrix elements, we obtain
Let us explain the Izergin–Korepin analysis performed in this subsection. For the case of elliptic models, we rely on the properties of the elliptic polynomials as expressed by Proposition 4.1, which are elliptic analogs of the properties of the ordinary polynomials. Viewing the wavefunctions W_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|v_{1}, …, v_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}|h) as polynomials of a single variable v_{N}, property (1) in Proposition 4.2 tells us that W_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|v_{1}, …, v_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}|h) are elliptic polynomials of v_{N} in Θ_{n}(χ). If x_{n} = N, we can evaluate the wavefunctions at the n points v_{N} = u_{j} + p − q_{N}, j = 1, …, n, and connect with smaller wavefunctions. Evaluation of the wavefunctions at v_{N} = u_{n} + p − q_{N} then essentially reduces to that of the smaller wavefunctions W_{N−1,n−1}(u_{1}, …, u_{n−1}|v_{1}, …, v_{N−1}|x_{1}, …, x_{n−1}|h + 2p), as in (4.23) of property (3). The evaluations at the other n − 1 points v_{N} = u_{j} + p − q_{N}, j = 1, …, n − 1, can be obtained from the evaluation at v_{N} = u_{n} + p − q_{N} using property (2). For the case of Felderhof models, this is not a simple symmetric property, in contrast to the XXZ-type six-vertex model, whose wavefunctions are symmetric with respect to the spectral parameters in the auxiliary spaces. The other possible case, x_{n} ≠ N, again has the factorization property (4.24), in which case the wavefunctions reduce to the smaller wavefunctions W_{N−1,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|v_{1}, …, v_{N−1}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}|h).The wavefunctions of the elliptic Felderhof model of different sizes can be connected by treating the two cases x_{n} = N and x_{n} ≠ N separately. Repeating this process, we have chains of recursion relations between the wavefunctions. We also need property (4) in Proposition 4.2 to ensure uniqueness since this property corresponds to the initial condition for the recursion relations. The explicit elliptic multivariable functions satisfying all the properties listed in Proposition 4.2 are nothing other than those representing the wavefunctions. This is presented in Subsection IV C.
C. Symmetric functions
In this subsection, we introduce a class of symmetric functions and prove that they represent the wavefunctions W_{N,n,m}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|w_{1}, …, w_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{m}) of the six-vertex model for a triangular boundary by showing that they satisfy all the required properties derived from the Izergin–Korepin analysis in Subsection III B.
Definition 3.2. We define the following symmetric functions depending on the symmetric variables u_{1}, …, u_{n}, complex parameters w_{1}, …, w_{N}, and integers x_{1}, …, x_{m} satisfying 1 ≤ x_{1} < ⋯ < x_{m} ≤ N:
Theorem 3.3. The wavefunctions of the six-vertex model for a triangular boundary can be explicitly expressed as symmetric functions,
Proof. We prove this theorem by showing that the symmetric functions in (3.19) satisfy all four properties in Proposition 3.1.Let us first show property (1). First, we note that the factors ∏j=1m∏k=x_{j}+1N(u_{σ(j)}−qw_{k}) in F_{N,n,m}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|w_{1}, …, w_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{m}) are polynomials of degree m − 1 in w_{N} if x_{m} = N and of degree m if x_{m} ≠ N. There is also a factor ∏_{m+1≤j≤n}(u_{σ(j)} − qw_{N}) in (3.19) that contributes to the degree of w_{N}, and we find that F_{N,n,m}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|w_{1}, …, w_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{m}) are polynomials of degree n − 1 in w_{N} if x_{m} = N and of degree n if x_{m} ≠ N.It is also easy to find that F_{N,n,m}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|w_{1}, …, w_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{m}) are symmetric with respect to u_{j}, j = 1, …, n, since the sum is over all permutations of the variables u_{j}, j = 1, …, n.Let us show property (3). We first consider the case x_{m} = N. We show that the functions F_{N,n,m}({u}_{n}|w_{1}, …, w_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{m}) satisfy (3.13). First, we note that the factor
in each summand essentially becomes
Let us concentrate on the factor ∏j=1m−1(u_{σ(j)}−qw_{N})∏j=m+1N(u_{σ(j)}−qw_{N}) from (3.22). If we substitute w_{N} = q^{−1}u_{n}, this factor vanishes unless σ satisfies σ(m) = n.Therefore, only the summands satisfying σ(m) = n in (3.19) survive after the substitution w_{N} = q^{−1}u_{n}. Keeping this in mind, we rewrite F_{N,n,m}({u}{n}|w_{1},…,w_{N}|x_{1},…,x_{m})|_{wN=q^{−1}un} using the symmetric group S_{n−1}, where every σ′ ∈ S_{n−1} satisfies {σ′(1), …, σ′(m − 1), σ′(m + 1), …, σ′(n)} = {1, …, n − 1}, as follows:
We easily note that the factors ∏k=1N−1(u_{n}−w_{k}) and (1−q)(un2−1) in the sum are independent of the permutation Sn−1′. We find that the factor ∏j=1m−1(qu_{σ^{′}(j)}−u_{n})(u_{σ^{′}(j)}u_{n}−1)∏j=m+1n(qu_{σ^{′}(j)}−u_{n})(u_{σ^{′}(j)}u_{n}−1) is also independent of Sn−1′ since it can be simplified as
Thus, (3.23) can be rewritten as
Noting that
we find that (3.25) is nothing but the following recursion relation among the symmetric functions F_{N,n,m}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|w_{1}, …, w_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{m}):
This is exactly the same as the recursion relation that must be satisfied by the wavefunctions W_{N,n,m}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|w_{1}, …, w_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{m}), and hence property (3) for the case x_{m} = N is proved.The case x_{m} ≠ N can be shown in a similar but much simpler way. In this case, we first rewrite F_{N,n,m}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|w_{1}, …, w_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{m}) as
The product of the factors ∏j=1m(u_{σ(j)}−qw_{N}) and ∏j=m+1n(u_{σ(j)}−qw_{N}) becomes
which is independent of the permutation S_{n}. Taking this into account, (3.28) can be rewritten as
which is also exactly the same as the recursion relation that must be satisfied by the wavefunctions W_{N,n,m}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|w_{1}, …, w_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{m}) for the case x_{m} ≠ N.Let us finally show property (4). This can be done by performing further analysis on the symmetric functions F_{N,n,m}({u}{n}|w_{1},…,w_{N}|x_{1},…,x_{m})|_{wN=q^{−1}un} for the case N = m = 1, x_{1} = 1. We first write down the case N = m = 1, x_{1} = 1 of (3.25), which we used to prove property (3) (we denote w_{1} by w),
Since
all the summands in (3.31) are the same, and the sum in the right-hand side of (3.31) becomes (n−1)!∏_{1≤j<k≤n−1}(u_{j}u_{k}−q)∏j=1n−1(Bu_{j}−A). Thus, we have the complete factorization
which implies that F_{1,n,1}({u}_{n}|w|1) satisfies the same property as W_{1,n,1}({u}_{n}|w|1). Hence, property (4) for the case m = 1 is proved.The case m = 0 can be shown in a similar way. Writing down the case N = 1, m = 0 of (3.25), we can immediately see that all the summands are the same, and we have
which shows that F_{1,n,0}({u}_{n}|w) is the same as W_{1,n,0}({u}_{n}|w).Finally, we can easily check from its definition that if n = m = 1 and x_{1} = N, then the following evaluation holds:
We have proved that the symmetric functions F_{N,n,m}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|w_{1}, …, w_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{m}) satisfy all of the properties (1)–(4) in Proposition 3.1, and hence they are the explicit forms of the wavefunctions for a triangular boundary,
IV. ELLIPTIC FELDERHOF MODEL
In this section, we show that the Izergin–Korepin analysis is also effective for evaluating wavefunctions of other six-vertex-type integrable models, taking the elliptic Felderhof model as an example.
A. Elliptic wavefunctions
We review the elliptic Felderhof model due to Foda, Wheeler, and Zuparic [79], which is an elliptic extension of the trigonometric face-type Felderhof model introduced by Deguchi and Akutsu [73].
First, we introduce elliptic functions and list the properties needed in this section. The theta function H(u) of u is
where q is the elliptic nome (0 < q < 1). For a convenient description of the matrix elements of the dynamical R-matrix, the notation
is introduced.
The theta function [u] is an odd function, [−u] = −[u], and satisfies the quasiperiodicities
The facts about the elliptic polynomials [83,84] presented below have turned out to be useful for the analysis of partition functions of elliptic integrable models of solid-on-solid models [85], related to the eight-vertex model [86] via the vertex–face transformation (see Refs [83],  [87], and  [88] for examples of analysis of the domain wall boundary partition functions of the eight-vertex solid-on-solid model).
A character is a group homomorphism χ from multiplicative groups Γ = Z + τZ to C^{×}. For each character χ and positive integer n, an n-dimensional space Θ_{n}(χ) is defined that consists of holomorphic functions ϕ(y) on C satisfying the quasiperiodicities
The elements of the space Θ_{n}(χ) are called elliptic polynomials. The space Θ_{n}(χ) is n-dimensional [83,84], and the following fact holds for the elliptic polynomials:
Proposition 4.1. References  [83] and  [84]. Suppose there are two elliptic polynomials P(y) and Q(y) in Θ_{n}(χ), where χ(1) = (−1)^{n}and χ(τ) = (−1)^{n}e^{α}. If these two polynomials are equal at n points y_{j}, j = 1, …, n, satisfying y_{j} − y_{k} ∉ Γ and∑k=1Ny_{k}−α∉Γ, that is, P(y_{j}) = Q(y_{j}), then the two polynomials are exactly the same: P(y) = Q(y).These properties ensure the uniqueness of the Izergin–Korepin analysis of the wavefunctions of elliptic integrable models. Recall that for the trigonometric models, the following trigonometric version of these properties ensured the uniqueness of the Izergin–Korepin analysis: if P(y) and Q(y) are polynomials of degree n − 1 in y and if these polynomials match at n distinct points, then the two polynomials are exactly the same.The trigonometric face-type Felderhof model was first introduced by Deguchi and Akutsu [73], and its elliptic extension was constructed by Foda, Wheeler, and Zuparic [79] and in Wheeler’s Ph.D. thesis [82]. In these studies, the dynamical R-matrix formalism was used for the description of the face-type Felderhof model. The dynamical R-matrix formalism enables one to describe the face model like a vertex model. A characteristic feature is that the height variable is incorporated into the R-matrix. As for the eight-vertex (solid-on-solid) model, the dynamical R-matrix formalism turns out to be useful for the construction of elliptic quantum groups [89–91].The dynamical R-matrix of the elliptic Felderhof model is given by [79,82]
acting on the tensor product W_{a} ⊗ W_{b} of the complex two-dimensional space W_{a}. The parameters u and v are spectral parameters, and p and q are complex parameters. h is called as the height or dynamical variable. One can think of the space W_{a} as carrying the parameters u and p, while the parameters v and q are associated with the space W_{b}. See Figs. 14 and 15 for graphical representations of the dynamical R-matrix (4.7).We denote the orthonormal bases of W_{a} and its dual by {|0⟩_{a}, |1⟩_{a}} and {_{a}⟨0|,_{a}⟨1|}, respectively, and the matrix elements of the dynamical R-matrix by _{a}⟨γ|_{b}⟨δ|R_{ab}(u, v|p, q|h)|α⟩_{a}|β⟩_{b}. The matrix elements of the dynamical R-matrix are given explicitly as
The dynamical R-matrix (4.7) satisfies the face-type Yang–Baxter relation (Fig. 16)
acting on W_{a} ⊗ W_{b} ⊗ W_{c}.We now identify one of the complex two-dimensional spaces W_{b} of the tensor product space W_{a} ⊗ W_{b} with the quantum space and define the L-operator L_{aj}(u, v|p, q|h) as the R-matrix R_{aj}(u, v|p, q|h) acting on W_{a}⊗F_{j}, the tensor product of the auxiliary space W_{a}, and the quantum space F_{j},
The next step is to define the monodromy matrix using the L-operators. For convenience, we denote the sum of complex numbers q_{1}, q_{2}, …, q_{j} as q_{j}¯,
The monodromy matrix T_{a}(u|v_{1}, …, v_{N}|p|q_{1}, …, q_{N}|h) is a product of L-operators
acting on W_{a}⊗F_{1}⊗⋯⊗F_{N} (Fig. 17, top).The B-operator is a matrix element of the monodromy matrix (4.17) with respect to the auxiliary space W_{a},
acting on F_{1}⊗⋯⊗F_{N} (Fig. 17, bottom).Using the B-operator (4.18), we introduce a state vector |Φ_{N,n}(u_{1},…,u_{n}|v_{1},…,v_{N}|h)∈F_{1}⊗⋯⊗F_{N},
where |Ω{N}≔|0{1}⊗⋯⊗|0{N}∈F_{1}⊗⋯⊗F_{N} is the vacuum state in the tensor product of quantum spaces.The B-operator (4.18) plays the role of creating down spins in the quantum spaces F_{1}⊗⋯⊗F_{N}, which follows from the ice rule of the six-vertex type dynamical L-operator _{a}⟨γ|_{j}⟨δ|L_{aj}(u, v|p, q|h)|α⟩_{a}|β⟩_{j} = 0 unless α + β = γ + δ. From this property, one can see that (4.19) is an n-down-spin state for n ≤ N.We next introduce the dual n-down-spin state
which is composed of states labeled by the configurations of down spins 1 ≤ x_{1} < x_{2} < ⋯ < x_{n} ≤ N.The wavefunctions of the Felderhof model W_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|v_{1}, …, v_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}|h) are defined as inner products of the state vector |Φ_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|v_{1}, …, v_{N}|h)⟩ and the dual n-down-spin states ⟨x_{1}…x_{n}|,

C. Elliptic multivariable functions
In this subsection, we show that the wavefunctions of the elliptic Felderhof model are expressed as products of a one-parameter deformation of an elliptic analog of the Vandermonde determinant and elliptic Schur-type symmetric functions. First, we introduce the elliptic Schur-type symmetric functions.
Definition 4.3. We define the following elliptic symmetric functions depending on the symmetric variables u_{1}, …, u_{n}, two sets of complex parameters v_{1}, …, v_{N} and q_{1}, …, q_{N}, two complex parameters h and p, and integers x_{1}, …, x_{n} satisfying 1 ≤ x_{1} < ⋯ < x_{n} ≤ N:
where xkN, k = 1, …, n + 1, is defined as xn+1N=N+1 and xkN=x_{k}, k = 1, …, n. Also recall that q_{j}¯ is defined as q_{j}¯=∑k=1jq_{k}.The multivariable elliptic functions (4.46) can also be written as
or as
where
We prove that the wavefunctions of the elliptic Felderhof model can be expressed as products of a one-parameter deformation of the elliptic analog of the Vandermonde determinant and the elliptic Schur-type symmetric functions S_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|v_{1}, …, v_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}|h). We use the form (4.46) in the proof.
Theorem 4.4. The wavefunctions W_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|v_{1}, …, v_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}|h) of the elliptic Felderhof model can be explicitly expressed as products of a one-parameter deformation of an elliptic Vandermonde determinant ∏_{1≤j<k≤n}[u_{k} − u_{j} + 2p] and the elliptic Schur-type symmetric functions S_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|v_{1}, …, v_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}|h),
Motivated by the fact that the Tokuyama formula could be realized using integrable models, Brubaker, Bump, and Friedberg [33] proved that the wavefunctions of a trigonometric free-fermion model can be expressed as products of a one-parameter deformation of the Vandermonde determinant and the Schur functions. This correspondence was later generalized to the factorial Schur functions by Bump, McNamara, and Nakasuji [37]. Theorem 4.4 can be regarded as an elliptic version of this correspondence. The model investigated is an elliptic generalization of the trigonometric models, and correspondingly one-parameter deformations of the Vandermonde determinant and of the Schur functions are generalized to the deformed elliptic Vandermonde determinant ∏_{1≤j<k≤n}[u_{k} − u_{j} + 2p] and to the elliptic Schur-type symmetric functions S_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|v_{1}, …, v_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}|h), respectively.
Proof. We denote the right-hand side of (4.50) by G_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|v_{1}, …, v_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}|h),
We show that G_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|v_{1}, …, v_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}|h) satisfy all the properties in Proposition 4.2, which was extracted from the Izergin–Korepin analysis.Let us first show property (1). When x_{n} = N, we can see that in each summand in G_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|v_{1}, …, v_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}|h), the factors depending on v_{N} are ∏j=1n−1[u_{σ(j)}−v_{N}−q_{N}+p] and [−u_{σ(n)}+v_{N}+h+(2n−1)p+q_{N}+2q_{N−1}¯]. We denote the product of these factors by f_{σ}(v_{N}),
Using (4.3) and (4.4), we can calculate the quasiperiodicities of the functions f_{σ}(v_{N}),
The quasiperiodicities (4.53) and (4.54) are independent of the permutation σ, which means that all of the summands of the elliptic functions G_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|v_{1}, …, v_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}|h) obey the same quasiperiodicities, and the following quasiperiodicities hold for these functions:
The quasiperiodicities (4.55) and (4.56) for G_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|v_{1}, …, v_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n−1}, N|h) are the same as those satisfied by the wavefunctions W_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|v_{1}, …, v_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n−1}, N|h) [namely, (4.33) and (4.34)], and hence property (1) is proved.To show property (2), we separately consider the elliptic Schur-type symmetric functions S_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|v_{1}, …, v_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}|h) and the elliptic analog of the deformed Vandermonde determinant ∏_{1≤j<k≤n}[u_{k} − u_{j} + 2p], the products of which give the elliptic functions G_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|v_{1}, …, v_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}|h). First, note that
obviously holds since S_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|v_{1}, …, v_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}|h), (4.46), is a symmetric function by definition. Next, looking at the other part ∏_{1≤j<k≤n}[u_{k} − u_{j} + 2p], we find that the following relations hold:
Since G_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|v_{1}, …, v_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}|h) is the product of ∏_{1≤j<k≤n}[u_{k} − u_{j} + 2p] and S_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|v_{1}, …, v_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}|h), we obtain the following exchange relations by combining (4.57) and (4.58):
These are exactly the same as those satisfied by W_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|v_{1}, …, v_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}|h), and hence property (2) is proved.Next we show property (3). Let us first consider the case x_{n} = N. We have to show that the functions G_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|v_{1}, …, v_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}|h) satisfy (4.23). We first note that when x_{n} = N, the expression for the factor
is essentially
The presence of the factor ∏j=1n−1[u_{σ(j)}−v_{N}−q_{N}+p] in (4.61) means that (4.61) vanishes unless σ satisfies σ(n) = n after the substitution v_{N} = u_{n} − q_{N} + p. Thus, we have to deal only with the summands satisfying σ(n) = n in (4.46) that survive after the substitution v_{N} = u_{n} − q_{N} + p. Note also that the factor
reduces to
for the case x_{n} = N since xn+1N=N+1 and xnN=N.Then we can rewrite the multivariable functions G_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|v_{1}, …, v_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}|h) evaluated at v_{N} = u_{n} − q_{N} + p by using the symmetric group S_{n−1}, where every σ′ ∈ S_{n−1} satisfies {σ′(1), …, σ′(n − 1)} = {1, …, n − 1}, as follows:
We rewrite the factor
cancel factors, and then rearrange the terms. We find that (4.64) can be rewritten as
Since
we find that (4.66) is nothing but the following recursion relation for the elliptic functions G_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|v_{1}, …, v_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}|h):
This relation for the elliptic functions is exactly the same as the relation (4.23) for the wavefunctions W_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|v_{1}, …, v_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}|h), and hence property (3) for the case x_{n} = N is shown.Next, we examine the case x_{n} ≠ N. First, note that since xn+1N=N+1 and xn+1N−1=N, we have
Using this, we rewrite G_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|v_{1}, …, v_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}|h) as
We use the obvious identity
to take this factor out of the sum in (4.70), and we get
This means that the elliptic functions G_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|v_{1}, …, v_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}|h) satisfy the same factorization (4.24) as the wavefunctions W_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|v_{1}, …, v_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}|h) for the case x_{n} ≠ N.The remaining thing to do is to check that G_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|v_{1}, …, v_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}|h) satisfy property (4), which is easily done from the definition of the elliptic functions (4.46).Since we have shown that G_{N,n}(u_{1}, …, u_{n}|v_{1}, …, v_{N}|x_{1}, …, x_{n}|h) satisfy all the properties (1)–(4) in Proposition 4.2, they are the explicit forms of the wavefunctions,
V. CONCLUSIONS
We have applied the Izergin–Korepin analysis to the wavefunctions of the six-vertex models and their analogs. We have examined three cases. As the first and most basic example, we performed the Izergin–Korepin analysis on the basic wavefunctions constructed from the U_{q}(sl_{2}) L-operator. We then presented the explicit forms of the symmetric functions representing the basic wavefunctions by showing that they satisfy all the properties of the wavefunctions extracted from the Izergin–Korepin analysis. The symmetric functions can be regarded as multiparameter extensions of the quantum group deformation of the Grothendieck polynomials since the correspondence between the basic wavefunctions and the symmetric functions reduces at q = 0 to the correspondence between the basic wavefunctions of the five-vertex model and the Grothendieck polynomials of a type A Grassmannian variety.
As a second example, we introduced and studied an analog of the wavefunctions of an integrable six-vertex model for a triangular boundary. We used the U_{q}(sl_{2}) R-matrix as the bulk weights and a triangular K-matrix as the boundary weights. We introduced these types of wavefunctions for a triangular boundary since there are similar combinatorial objects in algebraic combinatorics and Schubert calculus such as non-intersecting lattice paths and excited Young diagrams [52,54–57]. The Izergin–Korepin analysis of the wavefunctions under this boundary condition also works, and we found that the resulting forms of the symmetric functions representing the wavefunctions resemble but are much more complicated than the (K-theoretic) Schur Q- and P-functions. We remark that we have referred to the class of partition functions treated in this paper as “wavefunctions.” The basic wavefunctions treated as the first example are inner products between the state vectors of spins and the off-shell Bethe vector, which becomes the eigenvector of the XXZ spin chain when the Bethe ansatz equations are imposed on the spectral parameters. However, we do not know at this moment if the “off-shell” Bethe vector for the case of a triangular boundary becomes an eigenfunction of some Hamiltonian or commuting transfer matrix. This is why we have sometimes called the partition functions treated in this paper “analogs of the wavefunctions.” It seems worthwhile to investigate whether such Hamiltonians or commuting transfer matrices exist for a triangular boundary, and, if so, what are their explicit forms.
As a third example, we investigated the elliptic Felderhof model and showed that the Izergin–Korepin analysis also works for the wavefunctions of this face-type elliptic integrable model with the help of the notion of elliptic polynomials. We showed that the wavefunctions are expressed as products of a one-parameter deformation of an elliptic analog of the Vandermonde determinant and elliptic Schur-type symmetric functions. This result can be regarded as an elliptic analog of the results of Bump, Brubaker, and Friedberg [33] and Bump, McNamara, and Nakasuji [37], who showed that the wavefunctions of the free-fermionic models are given as products of a one-parameter deformation of the Vandermonde determinant and the Schur functions and factorial Schur functions, respectively. The free-fermionic models that they investigated can be regarded as variants of the Felderhof free-fermion model or the Perk–Schultz model, and elliptic extensions are known for both models. For the case of the Perk–Schultz model, the elliptic extension was constructed independently by Okado [77] and Deguchi-Martin [78]. We investigated the wavefunctions of the elliptic Perk–Schultz model in a previous paper [81], in which a similar correspondence can be observed. However, there is a problem that one cannot include a deformation parameter in the product of elliptic factors. The elliptic Felderhof model of Foda, Wheeler, and Zuparic [79,82], which is an elliptic extension of the Deguchi–Akutsu face-type trigonometric Felderhof model [73], has an advantage in the sense that one can include a free parameter in the product of elliptic factors, and a one-parameter deformation of the elliptic analog of the Vandermonde determinant appears. The result obtained in this paper can be viewed as a direct elliptic analog of the results of Bump, Brubaker, and Friedberg [33] and Bump, McNamara, and Nakasuji [37] for the trigonometric models. We remark that for the case of the elliptic Felderhof model, the free deformation parameter appears not only in the deformed elliptic Vandermonde determinant but also in the elliptic symmetric functions, which does not happen in the case of trigonometric models. As the elliptic model is a face-type model, the free variable corresponding to the height variable also appears in the elliptic symmetric functions.
Extending the analysis to other integrable models such as higher-rank models and to other boundary conditions is an interesting topic for future research. One example of such an extension is consideration of other boundary conditions when investigating the wavefunctions of elliptic models. At the level of trigonometric models, if one changes the boundary conditions to reflecting ones, then the symmetric functions that appear change from Schur functions to symplectic Schur functions [34,35,68]. It would be interesting to introduce elliptic analogs of the symplectic Schur functions and other symmetric functions by investigating elliptic integrable models under different boundary conditions. For example, one could formulate the wavefunctions of elliptic integrable models (the Andrews–Baxter–Forrester model and the elliptic Felderhof model) by using dynamical R-matrices as the bulk weights and triangular elliptic K-matrices [92,93] as the boundary weights, perform the Izergin–Korepin analysis, and find the explicit forms of the elliptic symmetric functions representing them with the help of complex analysis. See Refs [83],  [87],  [88], and  [94–99] for examples of the treatment of the domain wall boundary partition functions and scalar products of the elliptic and trigonometric face models by using various methods that have been developed to analyze such objects. A further interesting topic is the study of wavefunctions constructed from the R- and K-matrices of higher-dimensional representations. See Ref [100] for an example of work in this direction.

Graphical description of a local configuration of the elliptic Felderhof model. The state vectors are associated with the four circles in the middle of each of the four edges of the large square. We assume that a spectral parameter u and a free complex parameter p are associated with each of the horizontal edges connecting two circles (the auxiliary space), and an inhomogeneous parameter v and a free complex parameter q are associated with each of the vertical edges connecting two circles (the quantum space). The height variables are associated with the four vertices of a square. If the height variable at the top left corner vertex is fixed as h, then the remaining height variables at the other three vertices are determined by the parameters p and q governing the auxiliary and quantum spaces, respectively, and are not affected by the state vectors. This feature is significantly different from that of the dynamical R-matrix of the eight-vertex (solid-on-solid) model [89].
