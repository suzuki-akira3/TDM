Controlled modification of resonant tunneling in metal-insulator-insulator-metal structures
We present comprehensive experimental and theoretical work on tunnel-barrier rectifiers comprising bilayer (Nb_{2}O_{5}/Al_{2}O_{3}) insulator configurations with similar (Nb/Nb) and dissimilar (Nb/Ag) metal electrodes. The electron affinity, valence band offset, and metal work function were ascertained by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry, and electrical measurements on fabricated reference structures. The experimental band line-up parameters were fed into a theoretical model to predict available bound states in the Nb_{2}O_{5}/Al_{2}O_{3} quantum well and generate tunneling probability and transmittance curves under applied bias. The onset of strong resonance in the sub-V regime was found to be controlled by a work function difference of Nb/Ag electrodes in agreement with the experimental band alignment and theoretical model. A superior low-bias asymmetry of 35 at 0.1 V and a responsivity of 5 A/W at 0.25 V were observed for the Nb/4 nm Nb_{2}O_{5}/1 nm Al_{2}O_{3}/Ag structure, sufficient to achieve a rectification of over 90% of the input alternate current terahertz signal in a rectenna device.
The effective control of quantum mechanical tunneling through an ultrathin dielectric represents a fundamental material challenge in the quest for high performance metal/insulator (M/I) based diodes [1,2]. Metal-Insulator-Metal (MIM) diodes are contenders as rectifiers in rectennas (rectifying antennas) due to their high-speed operation, low fabrication cost, well-established high-k dielectric technology, and ease of integration with broad-band patch antennas [3]. The rectifier is the most challenging part of rectenna implementation. It is to be designed to operate at terahertz (THz)/infrared frequencies and above. The operation speed of MIM diodes depends on the tunneling transmission time, typically in the range of femtoseconds [4], and theoretically can reach to a few 100 THz or even into the range of the solar spectrum [3]. Structures with two or more dielectric layers as metal-insulator-insulator-metal (MI^{2}M) or metal-insulator-insulator-insulator-metal (MI^{3}M) benefit from resonant tunneling (RT) [5,6] which increases the device nonlinearity, leading to a high degree of rectification. The limiting parameter for small signal rectification is the turn-on voltage (V_{ON}) of these diodes, defined as a point where the tunneling current is significantly increased by resonance. The turn-on voltage in reported devices is very large, usually a few volts [5–10] being beyond the small signal amplitude. Applying a direct current (dc) bias to the diode is not practical in this design since the dc power to bias the diode at V_{ON} would be much greater than that achieved by rectification of the alternate current (ac) signal in the energy harvesting application. Hence, it is vital to design the device structure to bring substantial nonlinearity close to zero volts.
The resonant tunneling has been reported at 1.3 V and 2.7 V for triple cascaded insulator MI_{1}I_{2}I_{3}M structures based on Cr/Al_{2}O_{3}/HfO_{2}/Cr_{2}O_{3}/Cr [6] but not on double insulator MI^{2}M structures [9]. No asymmetry (η) and nonlinearity or responsivity (R) have been reported for voltages below 0.5 V [6,9]. The resonant tunneling has been predicted for the W/Nb_{2}O_{5}/Ta_{2}O_{5}/W structure, however not experimentally demonstrated [5]. In the case of bilayer MI^{2}M structures with a substantial work function (WF) difference between dissimilar electrodes of 0.6 eV (ZrCuAlNi/Al) [7,8] and 0.65 eV (Ni/Cr) [11], the highest asymmetry reported <0.8 V is 10 [7,8] and 16 at 0.5 V [11]. We have recently reported superior low-bias asymmetry (18 @ 0.35 V) and responsivity (9 A/W @ 0.2 V) for Al/Ta_{2}O_{5}/Al_{2}O_{3}/Al and Al/Nb_{2}O_{5}/Al_{2}O_{3}/Al devices, respectively [12], as well as enhanced rectification for Al/Ta_{2}O_{5}/Al_{2}O_{3}/Cr at V_{ON} = 0.32 V [13]. In this letter, we report resonant tunneling in the Nb/Nb_{2}O_{5}/Al_{2}O_{3}/Nb rectifier in the sub-V regime and its modification by introducing a dissimilar metal electrode (Nb/Ag) device configuration.
The devices were fabricated on 4 cm × 4 cm Corning glass substrates with an rms (root mean square) surface roughness of 0.32 ± 0.07 nm. The metals of 60 nm nominal thickness were deposited by thermal evaporation (Al and Ag) and by dc sputtering (Nb). The electrodes were defined by conventional photolithography or a shadow mask. The oxides were deposited by radio frequency (rf) sputtering using rates of 0.006 nm/s at 140 W for Al_{2}O_{3}, 0.045 nm/s at 100 W for Ta_{2}O_{5}, and 0.03 nm/s at 70 W for Nb_{2}O_{5}. The sputtering time was adjusted to obtain films of different target (nominal) thicknesses. The reference samples of thin (3–5 nm, referred to as interfacial) and thick (10–20 nm, referred to as bulk) oxides (Nb_{2}O_{5}, Al_{2}O_{3}, and Ta_{2}O_{5}) were fabricated on 50 nm SiO_{2}/Si substrates using the same rf sputtering conditions as the films in MIM and MI^{2}M devices. These samples were used to ascertain the optical properties and bandgap by variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE) and band line-up by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). XPS was performed under normal emission in a standard ultra-high vacuum system consisting of a PSP Vacuum Technology dual anode (Mg/Al) X-ray source and a hemispherical electron energy analyser equipped with five channeltrons. The spectrometer was calibrated, and so, the Ag 3d_{5/2} photoelectron line had a binding energy (BE) of 368.35 eV and a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 0.8 eV being the overall spectral resolution for this study. The XPS core level (CL) spectra were calibrated by setting the C 1s at 284.6 eV for all samples. A Shirley-type background was used for the fitting of all spectra. The CL positions are defined by fitting a Voigt curve to the measured peaks, which introduces typically an error of ±0.08 eV. The error bar (±0.2 eV) defined from XPS is due to valence band maximum (VBM) estimation through the linear interpolation method. To extract the barrier height at the M/I interface, the single insulator MIM devices with nominal 5 nm Nb_{2}O_{5} (or Ta_{2}O_{5}) films were fabricated using Al, Nb, and Ag electrodes. The MI^{2}M device structures comprised 4 nm Nb_{2}O_{5}/1 nm Al_{2}O_{3} patterned with Nb/Nb and Nb/Ag electrodes and a device area of 100 μm× 100 μm. There was a variation in the nominal thickness for processed devices, 4.54 nm Nb_{2}O_{5}/1.15 nm Al_{2}O_{3} as determined by VASE (±0.1 nm).
Figure 1(a) depicts the extraction of the binding energy difference (δ) of secondary electron cut-off and valence band maximum from the XPS spectra for bulk Al_{2}O_{3} (top) and Nb_{2}O_{5} (bottom) samples. The ionization potential is determined as IP (eV) = hν – (δ + qV_{app}), where hν = 1253.6 eV and qV_{app} = 10 eV, yielding the values of 8 eV for Al_{2}O_{3} and 7.49 eV for Nb_{2}O_{5}. The electron affinity can then be calculated using χ = IP – E_{g}, where the bandgap (E_{g}) of Al_{2}O_{3} and Nb_{2}O_{5} has been found to be 6.43 eV (Ref [14]) and 3.77 eV (Ref [12]) by VASE in agreement with the literature [15,16]. Hence, the electron affinity measured for Al_{2}O_{3} and Nb_{2}O_{5} is 1.57 eV and 3.72 eV (±0.2 eV), respectively. The valence band offset (VBO) between Nb_{2}O_{5} and Al_{2}O_{3} was derived from Kraut's method [17] using the equation VBO = δ(Al_{2}O_{3})– δ(Nb_{2}O_{5}) + δ_{int}, where δ(Al_{2}O_{3}) refers to the BE difference of Al 2p_{5/2} CL and VBM for bulk Al_{2}O_{3} [Fig. 1(b), bottom], δ_{int} of Nb 3d_{5/2} and Al 2p_{3/2} CLs for the interfacial Nb_{2}O_{5}/Al_{2}O_{3} sample [Fig. 1(b), middle], and δ(Nb_{2}O_{5}) of Nb 3d_{5/2} CL and VBM for the bulk Nb_{2}O_{5} sample [Fig. 1(b), top]. No additional interface components were observed from fitting Nb 3d and Al 2p CLs of the interfacial 3.8 nm Nb_{2}O_{5}/Al_{2}O_{3} sample [Fig. 1(b), middle]. The FWHM of Al 2p_{3/2} and Nb 3d_{5/2} CLs is found to be in the range of 1.4–1.5 eV. Using the estimated values from Fig. 1(b), it is found that VBO= 0.48 ± 0.2 eV. It is worth pointing that two independent measurements confirm the same conduction band offset (CBO) between Nb_{2}O_{5} and Al_{2}O_{3} within the experimental error: (i) from electron affinity, CBO = χ(Nb_{2}O_{5}) − χ(Al_{2}O_{3})= 2.15 eV [Fig. 1(a)] and (ii) from VBO and Kraut's method, CBO = E_{g}(Al_{2}O_{3}) – VBO – E_{g}(Nb_{2}O_{5}) = 2.18 eV [Fig. 1(b)].
Figure 2(a) shows Fowler-Nordheim (FN) plots for MIM reference diodes, while the insets depict the schematics of extracted M/I barrier heights. A linear relationship between ln(J/E_{ox}^{2}) and (1/E_{ox}) can be seen, with an R^{2} > 0.999, being indicative of an excellent fit [16] and the dominance of FN tunneling (FNT) over the bias range. The barrier height at the M/I interface was extracted from the slope of FNT plots being equal to −42m^{*}(qϕb){3/2}3qℏ, where q is the electronic charge, ℏ = h/2π is Plank's constant, m* = 0.5 × m_{0} is the effective mass, m_{0} is the electron mass, and ϕ_{b} is the barrier height. Note that there are no consistent data available for the effective mass of thin oxides and values reported in the literature vary from (0.45–1) × m_{0} [18], 0.28 × m_{0} [19], 0.42 × m_{0} [20], 0.5 × m_{0} [21], and 1 × m_{0} [5,22]. It is worth mentioning that the variation of m* from 0.1 to 1 (× m_{0}) in this work results in a barrier height variation of ±0.08 eV, being well within the experimental error of band line-up estimation (±0.2 eV). The extracted barrier heights from Fig. 2(a) are 0.39 eV for Nb/Nb_{2}O_{5}, 0.56 eV for Al/Nb_{2}O_{5}, 0.72 eV for Ag/Ta_{2}O_{5}, and 0.74 eV for Al/Ta_{2}O_{5}. The work function of the metals is then determined using WF = χ + ϕ_{b}, resulting in 4.11 eV for Nb and 4.28 eV for Al. Since the MIM reference structure of Ag/Nb_{2}O_{5}/Ag did not produce valid (linear) FNT plots, the data from Ag/Ta_{2}O_{5}/Ag and Al/Ta_{2}O_{5}/Al were used [see right-side plots in Fig. 2(a)] to first indirectly determine χ(Ta_{2}O_{5}) = WF(Al) − ϕ_{b}(Al/Ta_{2}O_{5}) = 3.54 eV. Then, the WF(Ag) = χ(Ta_{2}O_{5}) + ϕ_{b}(Ag/Ta_{2}O_{5}) = 4.26 eV. In summary of the band line-up study, Fig. 2(b) depicts the experimental values measured in this work, which are used as input parameters for the theoretical study of resonant tunneling in MI^{2}M structures shown in Fig. 3.
A model for calculating the bound states in a quantum well has been previously reported [5,23–28] and was used to generate the data in Fig. 3. The model is based on a modified multibarrier Tsu-Esaki method [29,30], whereby the insulator stack is assumed to consist of multiple slices with different barrier heights. The transmission amplitude at each energy level is found by solving the time-independent Schrödinger equation [26] using the transmission matrix method [30]. Figure 3 depicts energy band diagrams of the Nb/Nb_{2}O_{5}/Al_{2}O_{3}/Nb structure under biases of 0.5 V [Fig. 3(a)] and 1 V [Fig. 3(b)] applied to the right Nb electrode. A quantum well is built between Nb_{2}O_{5} and Al_{2}O_{3}. The model predicts two bound states: at 0.23 eV and 0.39 eV for 0.5 V and at 0.01 eV and 0.22 eV for 1 V [see dashed horizontal lines in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b)]. These states can be observed as sharp resonant peaks on tunneling probability curves shown in Figs. 3(c) and 3(d). The other peaks of the more rounded shape refer to free running states at Eigen energies. The transmittance curves are generated as the product of tunneling probability and Fermi-Dirac function, which defines the density of occupied and empty states at each metal contact. A substantial decrease in transmittance for 0.5 V can be observed in Fig. 3(c) due to both bound states being above the Fermi level of Nb left contact, causing a significant reduction of the resonance peaks by the Fermi-Dirac function. Although the tunneling probability is much higher at 0.5 V than at –0.5 V bias, this is not the case for the transmittance. The current is calculated by integration of transmittance in energy and is found to be at –0.5 V nearly twice of that at 0.5 V. This suggests that the number of electrons at the energy level of the bound states is small. The scenario changes when the bias is increased to 1 V [Fig. 3(d)]. Here, both tunneling probability and transmittance have sharp peaks (resonance is close to the Fermi level of left Nb contact), and as a result, the current at 1 V is ∼1.5× higher than that at –1 V. The rate of the increase in current has become larger due to resonant tunneling in this case and theoretically overcomes the current at negative bias at a voltage of 0.88 V termed as rectification reversal. This phenomenon was investigated further by fabricating this MI^{2}M device.
Figure 4(a) shows current density (J) vs. voltage (V) characteristics for fabricated 4 nm Nb_{2}O_{5}/1 nm Al_{2}O_{3} diodes with Nb/Nb and Nb/Ag electrodes. A sharp increase in current and a change in curvature can be observed from JV curves at ∼0.7 V for the Nb/Nb device and at ∼0.9 V for the Nb/Ag device. The large signal rectification is ascribed to the device asymmetry defined as the ratio of current at positive (I_{+}) or negative (I_{–}) bias, whichever larger, to that at opposite bias, i.e., η = |I_{+}/I_{–}| or |I_{–}/I_{+}|, and is shown in Fig. 4(b). A measure of small signal nonlinearity is responsivity [Fig. 4(c)], defined as the ratio of dc rectified current (I_{dc}) to input ac power (P_{in}), i.e., R = I_{dc}/P_{in} = (I″/2I′)|_{Vp} [31], where I′ and I″ are the first and second derivatives of current at operating point V_{p}. There is a clear trend of enhanced asymmetry after the onset of resonant tunneling in Fig. 4(b); however, the effect is weak: just above 1 for the Nb/Nb device and up to 10 for the Nb/Ag device. The former agrees with the model [see Figs. 3(c) and 4(b) bottom]. Interestingly, a superior asymmetry (|I_{–}|/|I_{+}|) of 35.2 at a low bias of 0.06 V can be observed for the Nb/Ag device; however, this is not due to the effect of RT. This phenomenon requires further investigation and could be related to trapped charge in the Al_{2}O_{3} layer. The peak device responsivities are found to be 5 A/W at 0.25 V and 8 A/W at 1.1 V for the Nb/Ag device and 2 A/W at 0.05 V for the Nb/Nb device [Fig. 4(c)].
As can be seen in Fig. 2(b), the work function of Ag is 0.15 eV larger than that of Nb. Hence, the Nb/Ag device is not in the flat band condition at zero bias [Fig. 5(a)] and requires an external bias of ∼0.2 V to reach it [Fig. 5(b)]. Therefore, a larger voltage must be applied on this structure to form a quantum well compared to the Nb/Nb device. The first bound state forms at 0.41 eV at 0.5 V. However, there is no evidence of RT in Fig. 4(a) at 0.5 V due to the large energy difference between the bound state and the Nb Fermi level [Figs. 3(a) and 5(c)]. The conduction is dominated by direct tunneling (DT) up to 0.8 V until Nb_{2}O_{5} reaches the FNT regime [Fig. 5(d)]. We have seen no evidence of Poole-Frenkel or trap-assisted tunneling in fabricated structures [32]. The RT kicks off from ∼0.9 V [Fig. 4(a)] due to more electrons being available at the energy levels of two available bound states at 0.07 eV and 0.27 eV as shown in Fig. 5(e). It is evident from Fig. 4(a) that the rectification reversal shifts towards larger voltages (0.9 V) compared to the Nb/Nb_{2}O_{5}/Al_{2}O_{3}/Nb structure (0.7 V) due to the band line-up depicted in Figs. 5(a)–5(e). The conduction in reverse bias is a combination of DT and FNT when the applied bias is smaller than –0.6 V [Fig. 5(f)]. A further increase in the reverse bias beyond –0.6 V causes the Nb Fermi level to align with the conduction band edge of Nb_{2}O_{5} as shown in Fig. 5(g), and the device reaches the so-called step tunneling (ST) regime [5,7]. It is worth mentioning that the theoretically predicted value of rectification reversal for the Nb/Nb_{2}O_{5}/Al_{2}O_{3}/Nb device is 0.88 V, while the experimentally observed value is 0.7 V. This is due to the actual thickness of Nb_{2}O_{5} being ∼0.5 nm higher than the nominal value of 4 nm used in the model in Fig. 3; hence, the portion of potential applied on 4.5 nm Nb_{2}O_{5} becomes larger and results in the formation of the quantum well at smaller voltages.
In summary, we have fabricated high-quality bilayer 4 nm Nb_{2}O_{5}/1 nm Al_{2}O_{3} rectifiers based on similar (Nb/Nb) and dissimilar (Nb/Ag) electrodes. The quantum mechanical tunneling has been shown to dominate the conduction with the clear shift of the onset of resonant tunneling from 0.7 to 0.9 V due to the metal work function difference. This confirms that the controlled modification of resonant tunneling in MI^{2}M diodes is feasible. A superior low-bias asymmetry of 35 at 0.1 V and a responsivity of 5 A/W at 0.25 V have been observed for the Nb/Ag device structure. Although such asymmetry would allow us to have over 90% of the input ac signal rectified in a rectenna device, challenges for implementation of this rectifier remain due to a time constant being much higher than required 10^{−15 }s. The necessary advancements are needed in engineering a lower M/I barrier and scaling device area in the nanometer range to achieve rectifiers for practical applications.
