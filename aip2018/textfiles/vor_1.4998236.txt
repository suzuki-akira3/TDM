An insight into Newton's cooling law using fractional calculus
For small temperature differences between a heated body and its environment, Newton's law of cooling predicts that the instantaneous rate of change of temperature of any heated body with respect to time is proportional to the difference in temperature of the body with the ambient, time being measured in integer units. Our experiments on the cooling of different liquids (water, mustard oil, and mercury) did not fit the theoretical predictions of Newton's law of cooling in this form. The solution was done using both Caputo and Riemann-Liouville type fractional derivatives to check if natural phenomena showed any preference in mathematics. In both cases, we find that cooling of liquids has an identical value of the fractional derivative of time that increases with the viscosity of the liquid. On the other hand, the cooling studies on metal alloys could be fitted exactly by integer order time derivative equations. The proportionality constant between heat flux and temperature difference was examined with respect to variations in the depth of liquid and exposed surface area. A critical combination of these two parameters signals a change in the mode of heat transfer within liquids. The equivalence between the proportionality constants for the Caputo and Riemann-Liouville type derivatives is established.
I. INTRODUCTION
In a letter to L'Hospital in 1695, Leibniz raised the possibility of generalising differentiation to fractional order and asked what the result would be of half differentiating a function. He then himself replied, “It leads to a paradox, from which one day useful consequences will be drawn.” [1] From then on, Fractional Calculus has been under scrutiny for many years and there are several studies available across digital platforms. However, it is only in the past few decades or so that it has drawn the attention of mainstream science as a way to describe the dynamics of complex phenomena with long term memory, spatial heterogeneity, and non-stationary statistics, described in Refs [2] and  [3]. Applications of fractional differential equations include the study of visco-elastic materials, turbulence, phase transition, complex networks, di-electric relaxations, control systems, and several other physical phenomena. A lucid and comprehensive study on fractional differintegrals, fractional differential equations, and their applications has been provided in Ref [2]. There are studies on fractional time derivatives and memory effects [4] and their applications in electrodynamics [5], heat transfer processes [6], rheology and memory effects of viscoelastic materials [7–9], and the mathematical modelling of dynamical complex systems, such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in economics and population growth [10].
One complex process that has received quite an amount of attention in the last few decades is Newton's law of cooling. Newton's law of cooling states that the rate of heat loss of a body is directly proportional to the difference in the temperatures between the body and its surroundings provided the temperature difference is small and the nature of radiating surface remains same. Some historical notes on this process can be found in Refs [11] and  [12]. The nearly endless discussions about Newton's law of cooling may be summarized by the statement of O'Connell [13]: “Newton's law of cooling is one of those empirical statements about natural phenomena that should not work, but does.” Similarly, in 1969, it was stated that “there is no definitive body of experimental data which defines the limits within which reality conforms to the law” and experiments using steady air flow around hot objects led to the conclusion that cooling in air proceeded geometrically (i.e., following exponential decay) up to 200 °C [11].
In this paper, we shall use fractional calculus to analyse cooling curves of several liquids and solids. Why Fractional Calculus?
We all know that the classical differentiation with respect to a variable gives the slope at a particular point on a curve. If the variable is time, the classical derivative gives the time rate of change at the particular point in time, so it is a local property. But as fractional differentiation involves integration over time from the past up to the present point of interest, it is no longer a local property, but involves past history, rather like classical integration. Thus, in generalized calculus, the term “differ-integration” is used as there is no fundamental difference between differentiation and integration, and “memory” of the past is built into the differ-integration process. In classical integration, we take all values of a function from the starting point of the function to the desired point, i.e., we memorize all the past points and then do classical integration to sum them. Fractional integration on the other hand yields the area under a shape changing curve, i.e., as one moves on, the shape of the curve also changes. Hence, as one moves on, past memory fades, often called “fading memory.” [2] Thus, it is all about taking rate of change of a variable, here temperature, with respect to fractional differential of time which defines Δt, the “window of observation.” While the classical differential is Δt^{α} with α = 1, the fractional differential is Δt^{α} with α<1. Further, the classical derivative is defined as Δt→0. In fractional calculus, as the order of the derivative α is always <1, the fractional differential will always be greater than classical differential as Δt→0. This makes the “window of observation” to view complex dynamics effectively larger, as compared to Δt. For example, if we take the classical differential to find the rate of change of temperature as 0.01 s, then assuming α=0.5 (for the sake of simplicity), the fractional differential is 0.1 s, i.e., “window of observation” is 10 times that of classical differential. Thus, as we make Δt from milli, to micro, to pico towards zero (infinitesimally smaller and smaller), the fractional differential, i.e., Δt^{α}, grows, helping us to view the dynamics which may be complex with several relaxation processes and several relaxation rates, better. Naturally, if the relaxation dynamics is composed of only a unique dynamics governed by a unique relaxation rate, there is no need to expand the “viewing window” by fractional differential. In this simple case, classical differential will do, and the classical rate definition is valid, and therefore, classical Newtonian integer derivative holds.
While fractional calculus may be the answer to understanding many complex processes in nature, a question that comes to mind is which calculus does Nature follow? There are several definitions of fractional derivative that have been proposed. A short discussion of these definitions is elaborated in the Appendix. Out of which the most commonly used definitions of fractional integral is the Riemann-Liouville (RL) integral. The (RL) integral is defined as follows:
From above, the Riemann-Liouville (RL) derivative of order α is defined as
The RL derivative is thus Dtαf(t)=Dt1(It1−αf(t)), for 0<α<1, that is fractional integration of (1−α) followed by 1-whole-integer differentiation. If we do the reverse operation, we get the Caputo derivative, i.e., ^{C}Dtαf(t)=It1−α(Dt1f(t)). In integral form, we write Caputo derivative for 0<α<1 as
where
for t > 0, α∈ℜ^{+}. These two are the basic definitions of fractional derivative used here to describe Newton's law of cooling. Also, we may point out that the Caputo derivative requires integer order initial states, whereas RL derivatives require fractional order initial states. This fractional-initial state is hard to visualize physically. Though Caputo is more popular, it requires a priori the function T(t) to be differentiable; thus, it is restrictive. RL derivatives, however, do not require differentiability condition for T(t). In our paper, we will use these two fractional derivatives in study of Newton's law of cooling.
In Sec. II, we shall briefly develop the theory for Newton's law of cooling using fractional calculus. We shall follow this with our experiments on different liquids and solids, then compare the experimental results with the theoretical predictions, and finally conclude with a discussion of these results.
II. ANALYSIS OF NEWTON'S LAW OF COOLING
Newton's law of cooling states that “The rate at which the temperature of a body decreases with time is proportional to the difference in temperature between the body and its surroundings.” In mathematical form, it may be written as
where T(t) is the temperature of the body at any time t, and T_{a} is the ambient temperature. There are several assumptions underlying the statement of this law, the main ones being the constancy of heat capacity and the smallness of temperature difference. The presence of thermal gradient inside the cooling body is found to hamper a good fit of experimental data to the law in this simple form. The constant of proportionality λ is obviously negative because heat always flows from the higher temperature region to a lower one and is dependent on system properties, λ=hAC. Here, h is the heat transfer coefficient, A the area, and C the thermal heat capacity. λ has the units of s^{−1}. This implies
where ΔT=(T(t)−T_{a}).
Since
where C is the heat capacity and q the heat flux, differentiating with respect to t, we get
Substituting C from Eqs. (5) to (6), we get
From Eq. (7), this implies
where λ=hA/C. This cooling constant can be determined by integrating Eq. (4) from 0 to t, taking T(0)=T_{0}.
A. Solution using classical calculus
Newton's law of cooling given by Eq. (4) can be solved using classical calculus for λ<0, with the initial condition
where T_{0} is the initial temperature of the hot body at t = 0. Taking the Laplace transform of Eq. (4), we get
Rearranging the terms and implementing the initial condition, we get
Taking the inverse Laplace transform of the above equation, we arrive at the final solution
To test the validity of Eq. (14), a cooling experiment was performed on a certain volume of water and the data were recorded. The theoretical solution of Eq. (14) was plotted with the λ determined from Eq. (9). Figure 1 compares the experimental and theoretical curves, clearly showing the inadequacy of the classical solution.
B. Solution using fractional calculus
The general differential equation describing Newton's law of cooling is given by
where the parameter β indicates the type of fractional derivative, i.e., β = 0 for the Riemann-Liouville (RL) derivative and β = 1 for the Caputo derivative. α is the order of the fractional derivative, T(t) is the instantaneous temperature, T_{a} is the ambient temperature, and λ is the proportionality constant. Taking the Laplace transform of both sides of Eq. (15), we get
The Laplace transform of the αth order fractional derivative of type β is given by
where T_{0} is the initial temperature.
1. Solution using Caputo type derivative
We take the Laplace transform of Eq. (16) and use Eq. (17) together with β = 1 and the initial condition of Eq. (10) to obtain
Taking the inverse Laplace transform of Eq. (18), we get
where we have used the Laplace transform of the two parameter Mittag-Leffler function
Here, Eα,βk(t) is the kth derivative of the two parameter Mittag-Leffler function, i.e., E_{α,β}(t), which is given by
The kth (k=0,1,2,3,….) derivative of E_{α,β}(z), i.e., Eα,βk(z) is given by
To obtain the classical solution equation (14), we put α = 1 in Eq. (19) such that Eq. (21) becomes
This reduces Eq. (19) to the form of Eq. (14). There is no such closed form equation as Eq. (8) to evaluate λ in the case of fractional calculus. The experimental curve was compared with the theoretical one for different values of lambda, and the lambda for which the best fit was obtained was taken as the value of the constant. To do this fitting judiciously, we used the software “MATHCAD 2001 Professional.” This was done because of the absence of a clear definition of ln_{α}(λ) analogous to ln(z) presently.
2. Solution using the Riemann-Liouville type derivative
In this case, β = 0 in Eq. (15) and with different proportionality constant κ, the Laplace transform yields
Here
is the Riemann-Liouville integral. Equation (24) may be simplified to obtain
Here, C_{0} is the RL integral at time t = 0. Taking the inverse Laplace transform and using Eqs. (20) and (21), we get
There is no such closed form equation as Eq. (8) to evaluate κ in the case of fractional calculus. As before, the experimental curve was compared with the theoretical one for different values of κ using the software “MATHCAD 2001 Professional,” and the best fit value was determined.
If we put α = 1 in Eq. (27), we get
3. Evaluation of the constant C_{0} in the Riemann-Liouville solution
Let
If we were to write C_{0}=A and
we see that G_{α}(t) blows up at t = 0 as 0<α<1, that is,
Let Gα−1(t) represent the inverse function of G_{α}(t) such that Gα−1(t)=t^{1−α}F(t) and G_{α}(t)Gα−1(t)=1.
Substituting their values and expanding in terms of the two parameter Mittag-Leffler function, we can write
As limt→0G_{α}(t)Gα−1(t)=1, we find limt→0F(t)Γ(α)=1, i.e.,
From the Caputo solution equation (19), C_{0}=T_{0}. Thus, A=T_{0}t^{1−α}Γ(α). Substituting the values of A and G_{α}(t), in Eq. (27), the final form of the Riemann-Liouville solution becomes
III. EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS
We performed experiments to verify the solutions obtained by the Caputo and RL differential equations. There is a further need to determine the value of the order α of the derivative and the proportionality constant. Cooling experiments were performed with different liquids and metal solids under identical ambient conditions. In the case of liquids, the samples included water, mercury, and mustard oil. In the case of water, 40 ml, 80 ml, and 300 ml by volume were taken in Borosil beakers and heated to a specific temperature. Its cooling data were then noted with time. The experiments were repeated at least five times for each volume of water. Also, different heights of water column were taken in a beaker of known surface area, and the same experiment was performed to analyse the dependence of the constant λ and κ on the height of the liquid column. Finally, the same height of water was taken in beakers of different surface areas, and the experiment was repeated to analyse the effect of surface area on the value of the constants λ and κ. The experiments with mercury and mustard oil were performed with a single volume.
In the case of the solid, the setup for the “Lee-Charlton's method of determination of conductivity for a bad conductor” [14] was used. The slab of alloy was heated with steam. After a steady state temperature was reached, the steam was cut off and the slab was allowed to cool while its temperature was noted down at regular intervals of time. In every case, the ambient temperature T_{a} was noted.
IV. RESULTS
A. Cooling results of liquids
The experiments with water were done with 40 ml, 80 ml, and 300 ml, and each set was repeated at least five times. As the experiments were performed on different days, the ambient conditions differed slightly for each. The fractional coefficient α was however the same for every set. Figure 2 shows the typical experimental cooling curves obtained with two different volumes of water, 40 ml and 300 ml, and these are compared with the result obtained using the classical integer solution and the Caputo solution. It is clear that the integer order solution fails to fit the experimental data, whereas a very good fit is obtained using the Caputo solution with the fractional order of the time derivative α=0.79 in each case. We tried to fit the experimental data for different volumes of water using the RL solution. Figure 3 compares typical experimental data with integer solution and the RL solution for the same two volumes as before. Once again a very good fit is used using fractional derivatives in the RL solutions, and integer calculus is a clear failure. The noteworthy point is that the fractional order in the RL solution that best fits the experimental data is the same as the Caputo solution, i.e., 0.79.
We performed cooling experiments with two more liquids, commercial mustard oil, which has a low specific heat, and mercury, the liquid metal. Figures 4 and 5 show the comparison of the experimental cooling curves with the integer order solution and both the fractional order solutions for the oil and mercury, respectively. The experimental data were best fitted using fractional order solutions, with fractional order α=0.88 for oil and α=0.92 for mercury. As the viscosity of our experimental liquids increase, the fractional derivative coefficient is observed to increase from 0.79 to 0.92. The proportionality constants for the Caputo type solution and the RL solution are however different in each case. These are displayed in Table I.
B. Cooling results of metal solids
Figure 6 shows that for metals, the trial with fractional time derivative is a failure. However, using the classical solution with α=1.0, a very good fit to the experimental data was obtained for both the Caputo type solution, Eq. (14), and the RL type solution, Eq. (28).
For the liquids, the fractional order of the derivative α and the proportionality constant for both Caputo and RL type derivatives, λ and κ, respectively, were arrived at by fitting the experimental data using Eqs. (19) and (31) by trial. It was observed that as the viscosity of the liquids increased, the fractional order derivative α that best fitted the experimental data increased. The summation involved in the Mittag-Leffler was limited to the first 120 terms as convergence occurred in the fourth place of decimal. In the case of the metal alloy, Eq. (9) was used to determine the constant λ and α = 1.
C. How good are the α and proportionality constant values?
A legitimate question may arise: is the particular value of α=0.79 just another fit parameter arising from some general phenomenological procedure, or is it a consequence of deep physical reasons? For this reason, we have checked the sensitivity of the fit to variations in the α value and the proportionality constant values for both Caputo type and RL type solutions. We make a case study for the cooling curve of 80 ml water.
Figure 7(a) displays a comparison of the experimental cooling results with the Caputo solutions and using different values of the fractional time derivative α for a proportionality constant λ=−0.109, for 80 ml of water as a case study. The same exercise was done for the RL solutions with the results displayed in Fig. 8. The “goodness of fit,” measured by the χ^{2} value of the distribution, for small deviations ∼∓0.02 about the best-fit α, is displayed in Table II, for the different experiments and all three solutions. This indicates that only a particular combination of α and the proportionality constants, where χ^{2} is a minimum, is successful in providing the best experimental fit. Multi-dimensional cross-dependent processes with long term dependencies have been discussed in other systems by Xue et_al [15] using effective spatio-temporal fractal modelling.
We find that for the same volume of the same substance taken in the same beaker and heated to the same temperature under the same ambient conditions, the constants λ and κ for the Caputo and the RL methods differ appreciably. This is because the two solutions are different. The RL solution, Eq. (27), has a one parameter Mittag-Leffler function as well as a two parameter one. But the Caputo solution, Eq. (19), has only a one parameter Mittag-Leffler function. The analytical relation between the two constants can be established, based on the fact that the two solutions must be identical. Therefore, equating Eqs. (19) and (31) and rearranging and expanding the Mittag-Leffler functions, we get
Equating the coefficient of t^{α} on both sides, we get
i.e.,
Table III compares the experimental values of the proportionality constant λ for the Caputo solution, with the theoretical values obtained from Eq. (34). This comparison is shown only for the experiments with different volumes of water using the corresponding values of κ. There is a reasonable match between λ_{cal} and λ_{ex}.
V. DISCUSSIONS
The modification to Newton's law of cooling was made in the order of the time derivative. We could have more easily changed its linear dependence on temperature difference to a different power and that would have saved a lot of trouble. We could have applied a different integer order to the derivative as well. But such manipulations would not lead to an exponential solution as is required by the experimental data. The fractional order ensures the presence of the Mittag-Leffler function in the solution, which is analogous to the exponential function and thus helps fit the data well.
To understand the role of the constants λ and κ for the Caputo and RL derivatives, we investigated their dependence on the height of the liquid column and the exposed surface area of the beaker. Figure 9 displays the variation of the constant λ and κ for different heights of the liquid column for a constant exposed area of the beaker.
The graphs show a sharp change of slope, indicated by an arrow, at a particular height.
We investigated the role of the exposed surface area of the beaker on the proportionality constant for a fixed height of the liquid column. Figure 10 displays the variation of λ and κ for different areas. The graphs show a discontinuity in slopes in both cases at a particular value, indicative of a change in mode of heat transfer. From Fig. 9, we find that the change of slope with height occurs at around 3.6cm, with an area of 60.85cm^{2}. This gives a volume of 219.06cm^{3}. The abrupt point in Fig. 10 with respect to area occurs at 61cm^{2}, with a height of 3.5cm. This gives a volume of 213.5cm^{3}. The two volumes are very nearly the same, and this fact requires further analysis. The changes in slopes of the proportionality constants with variations in height and exposed area suggest that there is a critical combination of these two parameters that triggers a different mode of heat transfer in the liquid column.
For the solid, the exact match with the classical law is an insight into the modes of heat transfer that exist in a material. Newton's law of cooling is exactly valid when the main mode of heat transfer is conduction. Also, it requires a constant heat capacity throughout the body of the material. For pure conduction, Newton's law is an exact mimicry of Fourier's Law. In solids, where viscosity is absent, the temperature gradient is almost absent in the solid material. But if convection effects are present, we need to introduce the concept of Biot number which is defined as the ratio of the convective heat transfer coefficient to the conducting heat transfer coefficient [16]. This is given by Bi=h_{conv}h_{cond}. This is the ratio of the outer heat transfer through the surface to the inner heat transfer due to conduction. For a solid, the latter is very high and Bi≪1. Thus, there is temperature equilibrium within the object and homogeneous temperature distribution. Vollmer [16] has shown that the heat loss due to radiation may not be negligible at room temperature. However, in this case, Stefan's law reduces to give a rate of heat loss that is proportional to the temperature difference between the system and the surroundings. Thus, the assumptions under which Newton's law of cooling is valid are satisfied, and for a solid, the classical solution gives the best fit.
In both the solutions, Eqs. (19) and (31), a term like κt^{α} or λt^{α} appears as the argument of the Mittag-Leffler function. Since these terms must be dimensionless, the unit for the constant must be a fractional power of time. This suggests possible memory effects within the material, which may be related to properties such as viscosity. The memory effect is incorporated through the use of the fractional time derivative as unlike the classical derivative which is evaluated at a given point, the fractional time derivative involves a non-local derivative from the past to the present points.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
Our main conclusions may be summarized as follows:
1. We observe that Newton's law of cooling can be expressed better with the help of a fractional power in the derivative in the case of materials where there exist convection effects and a temperature gradient within the bulk of the material. The order of the derivative increases with an increase in the viscosity of the liquid, being however identical for both Caputo and the Riemann-Liouville type of derivatives.
2. For solids, where the main mode of heat transfer is conduction, and the heat capacity remains approximately constant giving a negligible temperature gradient, Newton's law needs no modification.
3. The dependency of the proportionality constant on the height and surface area of the samples indicates that there are material properties at play. In the case of liquids, the existence of a temperature gradient within the liquid body is determined by the combined effect of liquid depth and exposed area. This will determine the Biot number, which plays an important role in the heat transfer process.
Thus, we find that fractional calculus is not merely a theoretical puzzle, but has applications even in the simplest of laws in nature.
APPENDIX: SOME DEFINITIONS OF FRACTIONAL DERIVATIVES
There are many definitions of fractional derivatives, but not all of them are commonly used. These definitions include Riemann-Liouville [4,17], Caputo [18,19], Weyl [4,17,19], Jumarie [20,21], Hadamard [4,17], Davison and Essex [22], Riesz [4,17,19], Erdelyi-Kober [4,17], and Coimbra [23]. All of these have their own advantages and disadvantages. We shall give a brief definition of these here.
The most popular ones are the Riemann-Liouville and the Caputo derivatives.
The formulation of the Riemann-Liouville (RL) fractional derivative (left hand definition) is given below in two steps. At beginning, we consider an integer m such that (m−1)<α<m, where the fractional order α>0.
(a) First, integrate the function (m − α) folds by the Riemann-Liouville integration method.
(b) Second, differentiate the above result by m folds
The expression of RL derivative is
If the limit of integration is from 0 to t, then the notation of this derivative is {0}Dtα[f(t)]. In fractional calculus, it is called as “forward derivative.” If the integration limit is changed from t to 0, the derivative is denoted as {t}Doα[f(t)]. This type of derivative is called as “backward derivative.” The relation between backward and forward derivative is
The formulation of the Caputo fractional derivative is exactly opposite to that of the Riemann-Liouville derivative. In this case, we also consider an integer m such that (m−1)<α<m, where the fractional order α>0. Then, 
(a) we differentiate the function by m folds and
(b) integrate the above result by (m − α) folds by the Riemann-Liouville integration method.
The expression of Caputo derivative is
Guy Jumarie proposed a simple alternative definition to the Riemann-Liouville derivative
For the case of Weyl, we have the following definition:
With the Jumarie definition which is actually the modified Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative, an arbitrary continuous function need not be differentiable; the fractional derivative of a constant is equal to zero and more importantly it removes singularity at the origin for all functions for which f(0) = constant, e.g., the exponential functions and Mittag-Leffler functions. With the Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative, an arbitrary function need not be continuous at the origin and it need not be differentiable. One of the great advantages of the Caputo fractional derivative is that it allows traditional initial and boundary conditions to be included in the formulation of the problem. In addition, its derivative for a constant is zero.
Although the fractional derivatives have great advantages, there are not applicable in all situations. The Riemann-Liouville derivative of a constant is not zero. In addition, if an arbitrary function is a constant at the origin, its fractional derivative has a singularity at the origin for instant exponential and Mittag-Leffler functions. These disadvantages reduce the field of application of the Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative. Caputo derivative demands higher conditions of regularity for differentiability: to compute the fractional derivative of a function in the Caputo sense, we must first calculate its derivative. Caputo derivatives are defined only for differentiable functions while functions that have no first-order derivative might have fractional derivatives of all orders less than one in the Riemann-Liouville sense. With the Jumarie fractional derivative, if the function is not continuous at the origin, the fractional derivative will not exist.
