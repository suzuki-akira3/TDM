Biogas supported bi-level macro energy hub management system for residential customers
In energy distribution systems, micro hubs are concerned about cost, whereas utilities or macro energy hubs (MEHs) are sensitive to network load deviations. This paper investigates the nature of the customer-utility relationship using a two-step methodology. In the first step, a two-tier centralized MEH model is proposed for residential customers. In the second step, a mathematical model describing the nature of the cost-deviation relation is developed using the bi-variate regression analysis technique. The MEH model is solved using particle swarm optimization (PSO) and flower pollination algorithm (FPA) in MATLAB and proved that FPA is superior to both PSO and mixed integer linear programming. The analysis of the results shows that the cost-deviation relationship is complex, non-linear, and random in nature. Due to cost-deviation non-linearity, the deviation inflates while minimizing cost at the building level. Therefore, deviation minimization is necessary to ensure network stability. At the network level, when the deviation minimizes, the cost rises, proving that both stakes cannot be addressed simultaneously. To avoid this conflict, a community level biogas plant is introduced, which replaces natural gas during peak and mid-peak hours to bring the cost down. A reduction in cost establishes a fact that the presence of renewables is essential to simultaneously address the bipartite interest. The problem was later extended to 200 homes for a duration of 6 months. The results show large cost, emission and deviation reduction, as well as significant revenue generation, demonstrating that the proposed model could be adopted by distribution utilities for the optimal scheduling of appliances and the dispatch of energy sources.
I. INTRODUCTION
In recent years, both energy demands and prices have increased. As a result, many countries around the globe are facing severe energy crises. To solve this problem, options like “Demand response (DR) integrated energy hubs (EHs)” and “Distributed generators (DGs)” are quite attractive.
The micro EH approach provides building-level control over energy cost, consumption, and emissions, but from the utility's perspective, the load deviation presents a major problem. Large load fluctuations result in overloading, energy losses, high fault levels, higher equipment damage rates, network instability, and inadequate generation, transmission, and distribution resources. Network load variations for a cluster of micro hubs can be controlled by applying a macro energy hub (MEH) management approach. Macro energy hubs optimally manage buildings and utility networks for energy cost, customer comfort, and load deviation. In smart energy distribution systems, both customer and network related interests should be simultaneously pursued.
An EH can be defined as “any location where energy system activities such as production, storage, and consumption of different energy carriers take place” (e.g., a house, office, farm, or manufacturing facility) [1]. Pei et_al [2] developed an EH prototype and tested it for real buildings. The results showed an improved energy consumption.
To achieve optimal operational and consumption costs, the EHs are integrated with “DR strategies.” The DR capably moves the load from peak to off-peak hours of the electric grid. Load shifting is carried out through enhanced customer-utility interaction using smart energy meters. Demand response refers to “changes in electric usage by end-use customers, from their normal consumption patterns, in response to changes in the price of electricity over time, to incentive payments designed to induce lower electricity use at times of high wholesale market prices, or when system reliability is jeopardized.” [3] Reka and Ramesh [4] and Koliou et_al [5] discussed European energy market-based DR potential and the benefits of smart meters around the globe, respectively.
The literature reveals that DR integrated EHs can play a key role in addressing energy market problems [6–9].
Energy hubs contain DGs, such as solar, wind, and combined cooling and heating power (CCHP) units. A CCHP unit generally runs on natural gas (NG), but, unfortunately, NG resources are depleting, resulting in ever-increasing prices. Therefore, alternative fuels must be used. The literature shows that biogas (BG) is a suitable substitute in this regard [10]. The use of BG will also promote NG's use in other value-added activities, such as the fertilizer sector. The literature shows that the presence of CCHP improves the energy efficiency of customers [11–13]. In Ref [46], the authors investigated the effects of CCHP on building owners, with and without photovoltaic (PV) solar systems using HOMER software. The results prove that the presence of CCHP enhances the energy efficiency of the building owner. In Ref [14], the authors explored that plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) integration is a reasonable step to improve the energy consumption efficiency and reactive power compensation. Moreover, scheduling of renewables in an electric vehicle parking lot proved to be successful [15,16].
Centrally controlled microgrids are currently receiving a lot of attention. A centralized AC microgrid management and control strategy has been proposed with DGs for cost reduction [17]. A centralized energy management system for microgrids equipped with a unit commitment approach has been formulated for both isolated and grid-connected modes. The results show a significant operational cost reduction due to the optimal scheduling of all energy sources [18]. A linear residential EH model shows a meaningful energy cost reduction [19]. The authors in Ref [20] determined optimal energy prices on an hourly basis using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique for Ontario, Canada's load, in the presence of CCHP. The results show that industrial customers meet 92% of energy requirements from CCHP and capital recovery will be in 2–3 years. The authors proposed a mathematical model for microgrids that optimally schedule load and energy sources, allow the presence of renewables, integrate DR strategies, and store energy to flatten the demand curve for consumption cost reduction [21]. Anvari-Moghaddam et_al formulated a residential EH model for cost reduction while keeping the customer-comfort level within the desired limits [22]. A linear mathematical model for residential EH containing CCHP, a PHEV, solar panels, electric or thermodynamic loads, and thermal energy storage (TES) is proposed by Brahman et_al [23] Room and water temperatures are considered as thermodynamic loads. The problem is solved for energy cost and emission minimization using GAMS software. In Ref [40], an energy management system with high penetration of DGs and CCHP has been developed. The aim is to optimally track the energy consumption cost of residential microgrids. Microgrids have been studied under deterministic and stochastic conditions. The results show a significant cost reduction, and the presence of the CCHP results in economic benefits to the building owner. The authors in Ref [41] proposed a smart energy management system capable of working under various uncertainties like weather changes, load variations, and spot market prices. The results show that cost and emission optimally improve under deterministic and stochastic conditions. The authors in Ref [42] proposed a smart energy management system that acquires and processes data and determines the control signal for microgrids equipped with renewable energy sources. The results show optimal energy cost and emission reduction with improved microgrid performance. In Ref [43], a smart energy management system for a microgrid is formulated. The formulation aims at minimizing the energy cost and emission. The results show significant cost and emission reduction. An energy management architecture for residential buildings using model predictive control has been proposed in Ref [44]. The proposed control optimally manages energy consumption cost. The results demonstrate the success of the developed method. The work in Ref [45] presents an energy management system for residential buildings based on electricity tariff and customer behavior. An extensive modeling of air conditioners, water heaters, and an EV has been carried out. The work aims at reducing the energy consumption cost using model predictive control. The results show 10%–30% reduction in electricity bill. The concept of EH has been further explained in the literature [24–29].
A. Novelty of the work
1. Addressing two-tier requirements
The literature reveals that building- or network-level requirements have only been met independently, but there is no mechanism to address these two-level requirements, simultaneously. Therefore, a two-level control strategy offering a solution to this is required to achieve conflicting interests like cost and load deviation, simultaneously. This paper proposes a framework to attain this purpose.
2. Modeling the customer utility relationship
The relationship between customer and utility interests has not been mathematically developed yet. This paper presents a way to model the end-to-end relationship. For this purpose, a detailed MEH model is constructed and simulated to obtain cost and deviation data in the first step. In the second step, these data are related using the bi-variate regression analysis technique.
3. Investigating the effects of DR strategies
The model digs out the effects of the application of DR strategies on cost, emission, and deviation of micro and macro hubs.
4. Analyzing the factors influencing the customer-utility relationship
Factors influencing the customer-utility relationship have not been analyzed before. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of such factors.
5. Application of the flower pollination algorithm (FPA)
The literature shows that the flower pollination algorithm (FPA) has not been used for such EH problem analysis before. The solution of the proposed linear mathematical problem is obtained using particle swarm optimization (PSO) and FPA. The comparison of results with other techniques already available in the literature like mixed integer linear programming (MILP) shows that PSO has better strength than MILP and FPA has more potential than PSO. The FPA emerges has a technique that does not stuck in local optimum and provides better results. The results produced in this study have been the most optimum so far.
6. Proposing the smart macro energy manager (SMEM) for energy distribution companies
The present work also proposes the smart macro energy manager (SMEM) for energy distribution companies, to optimally track load deviation, energy consumption cost, and emissions. Such tri-lateral control improves network stability (reduction of load fluctuations) and helps to attain customer interest (reduction of energy consumption cost) and environmental stakes (reduction of emissions). The proposed SMEM is a comprehensive solution to solve the end-to-end problems in modern energy distribution companies. The results provide financial justification to practically implement the SMEM.
This paper has the following structure: Sec. II presents the development of a mathematical model of the MEH; Sec. III proposes SMEM; Sec. IV describes the solution methodology; Sec. V presents the results and discussion; and Sec. VI draws conclusions.
II. MACRO ENERGY HUB MODEL
An energy hub is a mix of multiple tools, such as DGs and DR strategies. Distributed generators, like solar, wind, and CCHP units, are installed in the EH. Energy produced by building-owned sources is consumed by the load, and the remaining energy is sold to the external grid. The micro hub shown in Fig. 1 is the modified version, with the addition of BG as an energy carrier [23]. The micro hub contains NG, BG, solar energy, and electricity as inputs and cooling, heating, and electricity as outputs. The EH contains a CCHP unit. It has four parts: power generation unit (PGU), heat recovery unit (HRU), and a heating and cooling unit. To make the energy consumption more efficient in hubs using CCHP, HRU captures heat produced in the power generation process, and this in turn is used to regulate water and room temperatures. To maintain room temperature, an absorption chiller (AC) has been used in combination with an electric chiller (EC) to improve the hub's efficiency [23]. The conversion efficiency of a CCHP is 60% to 80% [30]. To further enhance the hub's efficiency, TES and a PHEV are included for heat and electricity storage, respectively. Heat in excess of water-heating and room-chilling requirements is injected into the TES, and in the case of shortage, it is drawn out from the TES. The PHEV acts as a mobile DG and intelligently charges and discharges into the hub to positively impact the energy consumption cost. The micro hub control takes weather data, customer preferences, and tariff data and generates an optimal schedule of appliance and source usage for cost management. It communicates with building-owned appliances and sources through a radio frequency wireless link. The single-building concept has been extended to two buildings with a macro hub control, as shown in Fig. 2. The macro hub tracks customer cost, comfort, and emissions for optimal network load deviations. The macro hub control takes customer preferences and appliance parameters from the micro hubs. Tariff as well as temperature and irradiance data flow in from the utility and weather servers, respectively. The proposed concept for the MEH control or SMEM core is shown in Fig. 3 from an implementation perspective.
A. Micro hub owned generation sources
The hub-owned sources are solar photovoltaic and CCHP units. The models are described below.
1. Photovoltaic panels
Photovoltaic technology has matured sufficiently to be used reliably in the EHs. The output power from the solar panel installed in the ith home is described as follows [23]:
where i, P_{sr,i}(t), η_{sr,i}, S_{i}, I(t), and T_{ext}(t) are the number of homes, output power (kW), panel efficiency (%), panel area (m^{2}), solar irradiance (kW/m^{2}), and atmospheric temperature (°C), respectively.
2. Combined cooling and heating power system
Micro CCHP can be used in residential buildings with a rating of 5 kW or less, as it reduces the overall energy consumption cost [11]. Typically, NG is used as fuel in the PGU. But in this paper, a community level BG plant is proposed to simultaneously achieve customer-utility benefits by bringing down the energy cost. The relationship between the output power and heat generated is as follows [23]:
where H_{chp,i}(t), P_{chp,i}(t), and η_{th,i} and η_{e,i} are the heat captured from CCHP at time t (kW h), CCHP output power at time t (kW), and CCHP thermal and electrical efficiencies (%), respectively.
The relationship between the fuel input and power output is given as follows [23]:
where F_{chp,i}(t) and β are the fuel injected to CCHP (m^{3}/h) and conversion factor for 1 kW h to m^{3}, respectively.
Fuel for the ith home is formulated as follows:
where F_{NG,i}(t), BG, and DF_{i} are the NG fed to the CCHP at time t (m^{3}/h), the amount of BG available at time t (m^{3}/h), and the distribution factor for BG, respectively.
The sum of distribution factors for all homes is unity and is formulated as follows:
The operational constraints on CCHP power (kW) can be expressed as follows [23]:
where Pchp,imin and Pchp,imax are the lower and upper limits on CCHP output power (kW), respectively.
The operational constraints on CCHP produced heat are given as follows [23]:
where Hchp,imin and Hchp,imax are the lower and upper limits on CCHP produced heat (kW h), respectively.
The ramp rate limits of CCHP can be expressed as follows [23]:
where ramp_{i} is the ramp rate of CCHP in terms of output power in kW/h
where ramp_{i} is the ramp rate of CCHP in terms of heat produced in kW h/h.
3. Biogas plant
Biodegradable waste is a source of energy [31]. The use of kitchen, human, animal, and crop waste can significantly contribute to energy production and environmental protection. The mathematical model of a BG plant is shown below. For simplicity, it is assumed that a maximum of 0.0557 m^{3}/h of BG is available for a single home in mid-peak hours and 0.1665 m^{3}/h in peak hours. The BG is delivered through underground pipes.
Total biogas available per day for each house is formulated as follows:
The amount of BG mentioned in Eq. (11) can easily be produced from human, animal, crop, and kitchen waste for a single residence [32,33]. For i homes, the maximum amount of BG available for a day is formulated as follows:
B. Responsive load
Loads can be categorized as responsive or non-responsive. The responsive load can further be classified as curtailable, i.e., lights, and shiftable, i.e., washing machines, dryers, irons, pool pumps, and dishwashers. All other appliances, such as fridges, TVs, laptops, ovens, toasters, stoves, and computers, are categorized as critical loads.
1. Shiftable loads
The optimizer shifts appliances from peak to off-peak hours for cost reduction, with a required operation time to complete a task. Washing machines, dryers, dish washers, pool pumps, and iron boxes are considered as shiftable loads. The operation time falls within a user-specified time interval. This is modeled as given below
where j, O_{i,j}(t), and UT_{i,j} are the shiftable appliances, binary variable showing the ON/OFF state of the jth appliance of the ith home, and required operation time of the jth shiftable appliance (h), respectively.
2. Curtailable load
Light requirements are time dependent. External light enters through windows and doors during the day, reducing the need for appliance-generated illumination. During these hours, external illumination is considered. In peak hours, the lighting load is curtailed by a factor, as shown below [23]
where IL_{in,i}(t), ρ(t), and IL_{out}(t) and IL_{req,i}(t) are the internal illumination at time t (per unit), linear function of electricity price termed as the curtailment factor, and outer and required illuminations at time t (per unit), respectively. The curtailment factor is equal to 1 during peak and mid peak hours and 0 in off-peak hours. The required and external illumination data can be found in Ref [34].
3. Flexible thermal load
The water heating and space cooling loads depend on heat generated from the CCHP. The water temperature is given as follows [13]:
where T_{ws,i}(t), V_{cold,i}(t), T_{cw,i}, V_{i}, H_{ws,i}(t), and C_{w} are the water storage temperature (°C), volume of entering cold water (liters), temperature of entering cold water (°C), total water storage volume (liters), heat injected for water heating at time t in (kW h), and specific heat capacity of water (kW h/°C), respectively. The hourly hot water usage and total volume of the tank are taken from Ref [13].
Room temperature is as follows [13]:
where T_{in,i}(t), H_{air,i}(t), R, T_{ext}(t), and C_{air} are the internal room temperature (°C), heat required to maintain air temperature (kW h), thermal resistance of the building shell (°C/kW), atmospheric temperature (°C), and specific heat capacity of air (kW h/°C), respectively.
The constraints on water and room temperature are given below [23]
where Tws,imin and Tws,imax are the minimum and maximum water storage temperatures, respectively,
where Tin,imin and Tin,imax are the minimum and maximum room temperatures, respectively.
4. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicle as mobile energy storage
The PHEV charges in off-peak hours and discharges into the grid during peak hours, thus behaving like a DG. The expressions for the PHEV are as follows [23]:
The energy at time t is
where E_{phev,i}(t), P_{ch,phev,i}(t), P_{dch,phev,i}(t), Δt, η_{G2V,i}, and η_{V2G,i} are the energy in the PHEV battery at time t (kW h), battery charging power at time t (kW), battery discharging power at time t (kW), duration of charging/discharging, grid to vehicle charging efficiency (%), and vehicle to grid discharging efficiency (%), respectively.
The constraints on the PHEV battery charger are as follows:
where P_{ch,phev,i}(t) and Pcharger,imax are the battery charging power at time t (kW) and vehicle battery charger rating (kW), respectively,
where P_{dch,phev,i}(t) and Pcharger,imax are the battery discharging power at time t (kW) and vehicle battery charger rating (kW), respectively.
Upper and lower limits of state of charge (SOC) are
where SOC_{max,i} and SOC_{min,i} are the upper and lower limits of state of charge (%), respectively.
The amount of energy to be stored in the vehicle is as follows:
where P_{ch,phev,i}(t), Δt, η_{G2V,i}, Cap_{i}, and E_{phev,i}(t) are the battery discharging power at time t (kW), duration of charging/discharging (h), grid to vehicle charging efficiency (%), capacity of vehicle battery (kW), and energy level in battery at time t (kW h), respectively.
The amount of energy available in the battery is as follows:
where P_{dch,phev,i}(t), Δt, η_{V2G,i}, and E_{phev,i}(t) are the battery discharging power at time t (kW), duration of charging/discharging (h), vehicle to grid discharging efficiency (%), and energy level in the battery at time t (kW h), respectively.
III. SMART MACRO ENERGY MANAGER
Building an automation core or a smart micro energy manager provides user-level automation and optimizes costs and emissions. It is an integral part of the energy management system or home automation system. It takes load, generation, customer preferences, and energy market data, from the respective ends, as described in Fig. 3, to track the most efficient energy consumption pattern. However, with this arrangement, only the energy user benefits and a key network variable termed the network load fluctuation remains an issue. To tackle this, home automation systems should be integrated with the smart macro energy manager core. The SMEM is practically located outside the customer premises and is directly owned by utility itself. It manages multiple buildings to track the optimal load fluctuations in the network, while obeying comfort, emission, and cost constraints. The SMEM core is elaborated in Fig. 3.
A. Electrical balances
The expression without DR strategies like load shifting, curtailment, and flexible thermal loads is described as follows [23]:
where P_{grid,i}(t), P_{ch,phev,i}(t), P_{dch,phev,i}(t), η_{G2V,i}, η_{V2G,i}, P_{chp,i}(t)P_{sr,i}(t), D_{total,i}(t), IL_{in}(t), P_{li,i}, and P_{EC,i}(t) are the power fed to or taken from the outer grid (kW), battery discharging power at time t (kW), battery discharging power at time t (kW), grid to vehicle charging efficiency (%), vehicle to grid discharging efficiency (%), CCHP power at time t (kW), solar power (kW), total load at time t (kW), appliance generated illumination at time t (per unit), wattage of lighting loads (kW), and power fed to the electric chiller at time t (kW), respectively.
The expression with DR strategies is given below [23]
where P_{grid,i}(t), P_{ch,phev,i}(t), P_{dch,phev,i}(t), η_{G2V,i}, η_{V2G,i}, P_{chp,i}(t)P_{sr,i}(t), D_{critl,i}(t), IL_{in}(t), P_{li,i}, P_{EC,i}(t), O_{i,j}(t), and P_{i,j} are the power fed to or taken from the outer grid (kW), battery charging power at time t (kW), battery discharging power at time t (kW), grid to vehicle charging efficiency (%), vehicle to grid discharging efficiency (%), CCHP power at time t (kW), solar power (kW), critical load at time t (kW), appliance generated illumination at time t (per unit), wattage of lighting loads (kW), power fed to the electric chiller at time t (kW), binary variable representing the ON/OFF status of shiftable appliance at time t, and wattage of shiftable appliance, respectively.
Here, two-way flow of energy is considered. The hub owned excess energy is sold to the utility grid to reduce the load of the later.
The expression for cost is given below [23]
where cost_{i}, P_{grid,i}(t), PRC_{TOU}, F_{NG,i}(t), and PRC_{NG} are the total cost over a day (cents/day), power fed to and taken from the outer grid (kW), Time of Use (TOU) price of electricity, NG fed to the EH at time t (m^{3}/h), and NG price, respectively.
If only individual micro hubs are in place, the expression in Eq. (26) will be an objective function for a single objective case and Eqs. (27)–(29) will not be included, whereas both Eqs. (26) and (28) will be objective functions for the bi-objective case and Eqs. (27) and (29) will not be included. For an MEH, Eqs. (27) and (29) are taken as constraints. The building owner fixes the cost and emission limits according to his/her own liking. This concept is formulated as follows:
where cost_{i} and C_{th,i} are the cost per day (cents/day) and threshold fixed by the customer through micro EH control residing in the building premises, respectively.
Emissions are considered as an environmental concern to avoid adverse climate changes, threatening human health and the ecological system. The expression for emissions is formulated in the following equation:
where Emission_{i}, P_{grid,i}(t), μgridCO_{2},μgridNO_{x},μgridSO_{x},μfCO_{2},μfNO_{x},μfSO_{x}, and F_{NG,i}(t) are the emission per day (kg/day), power taken from or fed to the grid (kW), emission rates for grid electricity and NG, and the amount of NG fed (m^{3}/h), respectively. The rates can be taken from Ref [23].
The emission limit is formulated as follows:
where Emission_{i} and E_{th,i} are the emissions per day (kg/day) and threshold fixed by the customer through micro EH control residing in the building premises, respectively.
B. Thermal balances
The heat balance after CCHP is described in the following equation [23]:
where H_{chp,i}(t), H_{AC,i}(t), H_{ws,i}(t), H_{in,i}(t), H_{dr,i}(t), η_{in,i}, and η_{dr,i} are the heat generated by the CCHP (kW h), heat fed to the absorption chiller (kW h), heat fed to water storage (kW h), heat injected into the TES (kW h), heat drawn out of the TES (kW h), injection efficiency (%), and drawing efficiency (%), respectively.
The energy balance for room chilling is given by the following equation [23]:
where H_{AC,i}(t), COP_{AC,i}, E_{EC,i}(t), COP_{EC,i}, and H_{air,i}(t) are the heat fed to the AC (kW h), coefficient of performance of the AC (%), electric energy fed to EC (kW h), coefficient of performance of EC (%), and total energy for maintaining air temperature (kW h), respectively.
The ratio of electric energy fed to the EC to total energy for maintaining air temperature in the following equation is taken as the optimizable feature
C. Objective function
For MEH, deviation minimization is the objective and is given in the following equation:
where Deviation, P_{tot}(t), and P_{avg} are the network load deviation (kW), total power (kW), and average power flow in the network (kW), respectively.
Total network power flow is as follows:
Average network power flow is as follows:
The linear constrained optimization problem has been solved through PSO and the FPA, using MATLAB version R2013a on an Intel Core i5-5200 laptop with a 2.20 GHz processor and 4 GB RAM.
IV. SOLUTION METHODOLOGIES
The mixed integer linear problem formulated above has been mapped in both PSO [35] and FPA. Such a problem has linear objective functions and constraints, having all or some of the variables as integers. Integer variables make an optimization problem non-convex and therefore far more difficult to solve. Memory and solution time may rise exponentially as we add more integer variables. A method termed as “Branch and Bound (B&B)” can be used to solve the MILP problems. The benefits of the B&B method are that it is fast and provides good solution for large scale power systems but traps in local optimum. On the other hand, metaheuristic techniques, like PSO and FPA, are evolutionary techniques. The PSO has an ease of implementation, simplicity of concept, and fast convergence rate but traps in local optimum [47]. The FPA solves these problems by having better convergence characteristics, less time, and not trapping in local optimum. This is the prime reason for adopting FPA as a final solution technique for this paper [48]. The way PSO is adopted for this work has been explained in Fig. 4. Solutions provide a comparison between MILP, PSO, and FPA for accurate objective function minimization. Since PSO is already known, it needs no discussion, whereas FPA will be discussed in detail.
A. Flower pollination algorithm
Yang proposed a nature inspired algorithm in 2012 that uses the flower pollination process [36]. The algorithm is shown in Fig. 5. The main theme is the survival of the fittest and optimal pollination of plants. The FPA is administered by four rules:
In global pollination, flower pollen is carried by insects over long distances using a Levy flight distribution. The process is mathematically represented as follows:
where Xpk is the pollen p at iteration k, g* is the current best solution among all solutions in the existing generation, and α is a scaling factor to control the step size. Its value in this implementation is 0.1. S is the step size, L(λ) is the Levy flight step size, and Г(λ) is the gamma function. The value of λ ranges from 1 to 2 and is taken to be 1.5.
The local pollination (rule-2) can be mathematically described as follows:
where Xlk and Xmk stand for the pollen grains from different flowers, respectively, ranging from 1 to m of the same plant species. ϵ is a random number from a uniform distribution between [0, 1].
For discrete variables such as appliance ON/OFF, the FPA proceeds as explained below. The appliance ON/OFF can be handled by the Sigmoid function in Eq. (39)
where Xoq is the pollen representing discrete dimension q.
Then, a uniform distribution σ from 0 to 1 is drawn if
The complete flowchart of the study is shown in Fig. 6. In the first layer, data like solar PV panel measurements, customer preferences, and tariff are injected into the optimizer residing in the home automation core. The processor at the heart of the core solves the electrical and heat flow equations by randomly initializing the flowers and generates the optimal schedule to handle the loads and storages. The flowchart describes the cost and/or emission control in the building. Such control can be expanded to multiple buildings by adding a network level optimization layer outside the buildings. This layer will take irradiance, temperature, and tariff data from respective servers. The appliance and customer data flow out from building to the network level control. In turn, network level control optimally handles load deviations by satisfying building requirements.
B. Decision variables for problem analysis
This section discusses the detail of all cases and chosen decision variables for them.
1. Single residential building
The hub load consumes solar energy in daylight hours, but if additional energy is required, the least expensive source from among CCHP and the electric grid is opted for. During off-peak electric grid hours, when the energy is less expensive, the national grid is preferred over CCHP.
The formulated problem includes DR strategies like load shifting, load curtailment, and flexible thermal loads. Load shifting enables micro hub control to shift appliances, like washing machines, dish washers, dryers, pool pumps, and iron boxes, from peak to off-peak electric grid hours, for energy cost reduction.
The illumination requirement of building varies with time. During the daytime, external illumination sneaks in the building through doors and windows and adds up in the appliance generated light to reduce the lighting load. During night hours, the lighting load increases due to the absence of external illumination. In this model, the lighting load responds to peak and off-peak hours by the inclusion of the curtailment factor as shown in Eq. (13). Such a curtailment during peak electric grid hours reduces the energy cost.
In residential buildings, there are two types of temperature controls: (1) heat lead and (2) flexible thermal load. In heat lead control, the water and room temperatures are maintained sharply at a fixed customer specified value, whereas in flexible thermal load control, the temperatures vary within an allowed window [13].
The proposed problem has been studied by carrying out 8 study cases. The summary of all cases is shown in Table I. First three cases have cost as their objective. Case 1 represents the existing state of the power system with dumb charging of PHEV and without DR strategies. In this case, the customer turns on the shiftable appliances at his/her own will, without taking into consideration the peak and off-peak electric grid hours. Dumb charging allows the vehicle to interact with the electric grid in the charging mode alone, regardless of peak and off-peak hours. The opted temperature control is heat lead, and the curtailment factor is excluded. The particle/pollen dimensions for this case are
In case 2, dumb charging, load shifting, load curtailment, and flexible thermal loads are considered. The particle/pollen dimensions for this case are
In case 3, smart PHEV and TES are incorporated. The TES is an air tight space, capable of storing heat for a required period of time before its conversion into any other form. The particle/pollen dimensions for this case are
In case 4, all the attributes of case 3 are included, addressing both the cost and emission reduction as objectives, using Pareto Front Sets [37]. The particle/pollen dimensions are the same as Eq. (43).
2. Decision variables for two residential building macro energy hubs
In a two-building scenario, building 1 has a PHEV and the other does not. The purpose of choosing this scenario is to investigate PHEV's effects on micro and macro hub performance. A community-level BG plant is also considered. All other attributes are the same for both buildings as were for the single building case.
In cases 1–4, the particle/pollen dimensions would be the same as described above for a single building case, with a difference that home 1 has PHEV and home 2 does not. Cases 5–7 take all the attributes like DR strategies, TES, and the presence of smart PHEV and minimize the network load deviation. The difference exists in that case 5 takes cost as the constraint, case 6 does not take any constraint at all, and case 7 includes both cost and emission as constraints. The proposed particle/pollen dimensions for these cases are the same as in cases 3 or 4. Case 8 inherits all attributes of case 7 and adds optimal distribution of the BG among both buildings using the distribution factor (DF). The particle/pollen dimensions for this case having BG are
V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Initially two micro residential EHs are solved independently for a 24-h horizon from cases 1–4. Cases 5–8 present network level load deviation control for two homes together. The CCHP has a capacity of 3 kW. The battery storage capacity of the PHEV is 6.68 kW h. The departure time of the PHEV is 08:00 am, whereas the arrival time is 04:00 pm. The battery discharges into the micro hub between 04:00 pm and 12:00 am. After this, the battery recharges itself to full between 12:00 am and 08:00 am. During travelling, if the PHEV reaches a state of low charge, an internal combustion engine provides the required energy. Tariff, appliance, irradiance, and PHEV data and parameters assumed for the problem analysis are taken from Ref [23].
A. Energy cost optimization in cases 1–3
Case 1 applies the heat-led control of the CCHP. It does not allow any variation in room and water temperatures and follows the desired temperatures strictly. The desired water and room temperatures are 70 °C and 22 °C, respectively. Such sharp temperature control reduces the CCHP output, thereby reducing the power sold and the revenue. Case 1 clearly demonstrates that fine temperature control increases cost and reduces revenue, as shown in Tables II and III. The absence of DR strategies also plays a role in increasing the building energy consumption cost. Another striking aspect is that the cost of home 1 is quite high, having a low revenue compared to home 2, due to the unintelligent PHEV presence in the former.
In case 2, the DR programs, such as load shifting, curtailment, and flexible thermal loads, are considered. The permitted temperature range is 60 °C to 80 °C for water and 21 °C to 25 °C for room. It was noted that in case 2, the CCHP increased compared to case 1, with more power sold, less cost, and higher revenues, as presented in Tables II and III. The increase in CCHP power and power sold is due to the presence of the flexible thermal load. The permitted temperature variation allows the CCHP unit to produce more power. The reduction of cost in this case compared to the previous case is due to the presence of load shifting and illumination curtailment. It is also noteworthy that the cost of home 1 is higher than that of home 2, due to the conventional presence of the PHEV in the former. The network deviation in cases 1 and 2 is 15.4435 and 17.9464 kW, respectively. The results clearly show that the inclusion of DR strategies positively affects the hub cost but increases the deviation in the network by 16.21%. This provides proof that micro hubs shift the load from peak to off-peak hours of the electric grid. Such shifting of demands results in a peak rebound in low load hours. This may jeopardize the network stability.
Case 3 includes the TES in both homes and a smart PHEV in home 1 alone. The TES is building-based thermodynamic heat energy storage, whereas the PHEV is mobile electrical energy storage. Tables II and III show a cost and network deviation reduction in comparison to cases 1 and 2. A decrease in purchased power and a rise in revenue, power sold, and CCHP-based power are also observed. The most crucial point is that cost decreases compared to cases 1 and 2 and the deviation should have increased in response to this. But instead of the expected rise, it decreased, showing complex and random behavior. There are two reasons for this: (1) the presence of the smart PHEV and (2) the inclusion of the TES, proving that intelligent electrical and thermodynamic storages support both the customer and the network interests simultaneously. This also proves that the deviation not only depends on energy cost but also heavily depends on the type of hub-owned converter and storage.
Figure 7 shows the load before DR for home 1, Figs. 8 and 9 provide optimal electrical dispatch for homes 1 and 2 in case 1, Fig. 10 shows the network load deviation in case 1, Figs. 11–15 show hub loads after DR, optimal electrical dispatch, optimal thermal dispatch, room and water temperatures, and SOC for home 1 in case 3, Fig. 16 reveals the deviation in case 3, and Figs. 17–20 show optimal electrical dispatch, hub loads after DR, optimal thermal dispatch, and indoor and outdoor temperatures for home 2 in case 3. The comparison of the peak hub loads before DR in Fig. 7 and after DR in Fig. 11 for home 1 in case 3 gives a reduction of 21.74%. In Fig. 12, having electrical source dispatch, for home 1 in case 3, it is evident that in off-peak hours, the electric grid mainly provides power and CCHP's contribution is insignificant from the 1st–8th hours. From the 10th–17th hours, the electric grid is under the peak, the cheap power from the hub owned DGs like CCHP, and the solar replaces the purchased power. In these hours, as the solar power grows, it replaces the CCHP to further reduce the cost. Similarly, from the 18th to 24th hours during the mid and the off-peaks, the proportion of purchased power increases. Comparison of Figs. 12 and 17 for homes 1 and 2, respectively, in case 3, clearly demonstrates the effectivity of the intelligent presence of the PHEV in home 1. The PHEV power discharged replaces the purchased power from the electric grid during peak hours to lessen the cost of home 1. Figure 13 for home 1 in case 3 shows that whenever an extra amount of heat is required, it is drawn out of the TES, and in contrast, excess heat energy obtained from the PGU is injected into it. Figure 15 reveals the SOC variation during a day for the PHEV in case 3. Figure 10 shows a high deviation in case 1, whereas Fig. 16 shows the reduction in the deviation due to the TES and the smart PHEV in case-3. The water and room temperatures are within the user specified ranges in Figs. 14 and 20 for both homes in case 3.
B. Energy cost and emission optimization in case 4
Case 4 is the bi-objective, addressing both cost and emissions by considering the environment as a stake holder. Tables II and III show a decline in purchased power for reduced emissions. The reduction is due to the higher emission rates for electric grid energy than for energy produced from the NG. Similarly, power sold also decreases. Consequently, this reduction in grid trade reduces the deviation. Figures 21 and 22 show Pareto-optimal sets of costs and emissions for homes 1 and 2 obtained with the FPA. The most optimal solution obtained for home 1 is 111.2448 cents/day and 18.3457 kg/day. The tabulated results show that the cost of both homes increases to a small extent compared to that of case 3. In response to this rise, the deviation expectedly decreases. However, the extent of decrease against such a small rise is surprisingly high. This confirms the strong effect of environmental stakes on the stability of the utility network. The results prove that the inclusion of the environmental stakes positively favors the network owners.
C. Network deviation minimization from cases 5 to 7
With the aim of reducing the energy cost, the deviation rises as depicted in case 1. Similarly, the inclusion of DR strategies benefits building owners but further jeopardizes the network service quality as inferenced from case 2. The addition of TES and a smart PHEV in case 3 reduces cost and surprisingly reduces the deviation as well. The presence of emission controls in case 4 raised cost and brought about a very large decrease in the deviation. In case 4, the cost is low, but the deviation is still quite high, even after the positive effect of the TES, a smart PHEV, and the emission control. Such a situation will only be beneficial for customers in terms of cost reduction but does not favor the network due to the high deviation. For this purpose, both residential buildings are controlled under a second-layer manager, termed as the MEH controller.
Case 5 takes cost as a constraint by setting it less than or equal to 260 cents/day for each building. The worth noticing aspect in Table III is that the network deviation reduces from 12.5994 kW to 8.6432 kW, a decrease of 31.360%, but cost increased to 234.5412 and 241.4489 cents/day for homes 1 and 2, respectively, thereby jeopardizing the customer end benefits.
Case 6 does not include cost and emissions as constraints. The results show that the deviation reduces by 64.62% compared to that in case 2—this is due primarily to the absence of customer caring constraints—but cost further worsens compared to all cases. Figures 23–27 demonstrate the hub load, optimal electrical dispatch, optimal thermal dispatch, room and water temperatures, and SOC for home 1 in case 6, respectively. Figure 28 shows the network load deviation in this case. The deviation is the lowest of all cases. Figures 29–32 provide the hub load after DR, optimal electrical dispatch, optimal thermal dispatch, and water and room temperatures for home 2 in case 6, respectively.
Case 7 takes cost and emission (less than or equal to 22 kg/day for each building) as constraints. The deviation again increases due to the inclusion of customer care constraints, but it is still quite low compared to cases 1 and 2, shown in Tables II and III. On the other hand, the cost lowers compared to that in case 6, but from customer's point of view, it is still quite high. In case 7, the problem of network deviation was addressed by sacrificing the cost. The results in this case demonstrate that both parties cannot benefit simultaneously, therefore proving that the macro hub manager is higher in the hierarchy, having a greater priority than the micro control. If instructions flow down from the macro to micro controller, the latter simply behaves like a buffer. The micro hub controller's instructions are overridden, resulting in a rise in cost.
D. Data analysis using the bi-variate regression analysis technique
Cost-deviation data have been obtained from both PSO and FPA. The data obtained from FPA are provided in Table III and plotted in Fig. 33. Using the FPA data, a customer-utility relation has been developed and analyzed through the bi-variate regression analysis technique [38]. The reason for the choice of this method is that it allows us to analyze the nature of the relationship between two parties, that is, customer and utility. The correlation coefficient between cost (independent) and the deviation (dependent) is calculated to be −0.0002643. The negative number shows that the deviation is inversely dependent on cost [39], mathematically proving that macro hub instructions override the micro hub's aims. In other words, both are in a conflict, and a conflict-handling scheme is required. The value of the coefficient is close to zero, indicating that the relation is random and complex in nature. This confirms that the deviation depends not only on cost but also on the probability of the presence of certain types of energy storages and environmental stakes. In mathematical terms, deviation is a “probabilistic” variable. The bi-variate downhill regression model is given in Fig. 34, providing the best fit to the data. The derived novel bi-variate regression model depicting the non-linear customer-utility relationship is given in the following equation:
E. Proposed conflict resolution scheme in case 8
Case 8 presents a solution to the problem of high cost at low deviations obtained in case 7. Biogas is distributed using a DF between two houses. Biogas replaces the NG. The DF for two hubs is given in Table IV. The results in Tables II and III prove that cost decreases to a manageable level for both homes with a relatively low deviation of 10.7743 kW. It is worth noticing that the introduction of BG reduces the requirement of purchased power and increases power sold and CCHP power. Another benefit of this carrier is that the reduction in purchased power reduces emission for both homes compared to case 7. Figures 35 and 36 show that with the addition of BG, the customer comfort level rises, demonstrating another benefit of the BG. This case solidifies a fact that both utility and customer benefits, in an optimally operated smart distribution system, can only be achieved simultaneously, by introducing renewable energy (like BG) to the macro hub arrangement.
The problem was later extended to 200 homes for a duration of 6 months to investigate the effects on a larger scale. In this implementation, it was assumed that 100 homes have smart PHEVs and the remaining 100 did not. The results show significant revenue generation, as well as cost and deviation minimization, in favor of both the customers and the network, respectively.
The end-to-end benefits show that the practical manufacturing and installation of a renewable energy supported SMEM are cost effective and advantageous.
The results presented in Table V demonstrate that the concept can be applied to an energy distribution company to obtain two-tier effects around the globe.
F. Comparison of mixed integer linear programming, flower pollination algorithm, and particle swarm optimization
The results in Tables VI and II show that PSO is a better optimizer than MILP. Cost reduces by 11.43%, 5.99%, 8.3%, and 7.65% in cases 1–4, respectively, for home 1. This comparison is for home 1 alone because it is the same in the base case (Table VI) as well as in this implementation, whereas home 2 is different in a sense that it does not contain PHEV. The results in Tables II and III reveal that FPA in turn is superior to PSO. Cost reduces by 0.48%, 0.909%, 0.93%, and 7.08% in cases 1–4, respectively. The deviation in cases 6 and 8 reduces by 19.62% and 16.05%, respectively.
The literature shows that FPA has never been used for such EH problem analysis before and the results shown in Table III are the most optimum till now.
The optimization convergence curves for case 4, home 1 with PSO and FPA, are shown in Figs. 37 and 38. Case 4 is bi-objective, and both cost in Fig. 37 and emission in Fig. 38 are separately plotted against the iteration count to demonstrate the variation clearly. The curves for home 2 are not shown as they show the same nature of convergence. Figure 39 shows the convergence in case 8 for MEH having 2 homes with PSO and FPA. The comparison shows that FPA converges more rapidly to a better optimum than PSO. The reason for the superiority of FPA as an optimization tool is that its pollens move over larger distances taking Levy flights and therefore do not stick in local optimum. The reason for taking cases 4 and 8 is that both represent most matured of all cases.
VI. CONCLUSION
This paper presents an approach to develop and analyze the customer and utility network relationship. The modeling work consists of two phases. In the first phase, the MEH model is developed and simulated to obtain cost and deviation data. In the second phase, both variables are related to each other using a bi-variate regression analysis technique. The micro hub contains the CCHP unit, PHEV, the solar panel, the BG plant, electrical and natural gas grids, shiftable and curtailable appliances, and heat flows. At the micro hub level, cost and emissions are optimized, whereas the macro hub optimizes the network deviation to ensure stability. Cases 1 to 4 investigate two residential buildings independently. In case 1, the cost is quite high with the smallest CCHP contribution due to heat-led control without DR, TES, or a smart PHEV. In case 2, DR strategies like flexible thermal loads, curtailable lights, and shiftable loads are incorporated. The presence of DR strategies increases the hub generated CCHP power and reduces cost but increases the network deviation due to the accumulation of loads in low load hours. Case 3 includes TES in both homes and a smart PHEV in home 1 alone. Not only the energy cost further decreases but also the deviation decreases instead of expected rise due to the presence of electric and thermal storages. This proves the complexity and randomness of the cost-deviation relationship. Also, home 1 with dumb PHEV charging has a high cost, but the building with intelligent charging and discharging has a low cost, in the first four cases. The first three cases only address cost minimization. Case 4 is bi-objective, considering both emissions and cost. In this case, both purchased power and power sold decrease, with a very large decline in the deviation against a small rise in cost. This confirms that the deviation depends heavily on the inclusion of environmental stakes. Case 5 takes deviation minimization as its objective, with only cost as the constraint. The deviation decreases, but the cost of both micro hubs increases. Case 6 does not include cost and emission constraints and shows the lowest deviation with a further rise in cost. In case 7, both constraints are included, resulting in an increase in the deviation compared to case 6. But relative to cases 1, 2, 3, and 4, it is quite low with a high cost. Case 7 proves that the stakes of both the utility and the customers cannot be achieved at the same time, which is a problem for modern power distribution systems. By using these cost-deviation data and a bi-variate regression analysis technique, a mathematical model of utility-customer interests is developed. The negative slope of the model proves that the macro hub interests are fulfilled at the cost of the building benefits. The small value of the correlation coefficient proves that the deviation also depends on factors other than cost, including the probability of the presence of energy storages and emission control. Case 8 presents a solution to relational non-linearity by adding the BG to the MEH and bringing the cost down. An extended implementation to 200 homes for a duration of 6 months provides a justification for incorporating the proposed SMEM in smart energy distribution company networks to serve both stakeholders.
Simulations reveal that the FPA is a better optimization choice for EH management systems compared to previous methods. Future work will focus on modeling an MEH that successfully functions under solar PV probabilities, probabilistic availability of electric and NG networks, and random PHEV arrival/departure.
