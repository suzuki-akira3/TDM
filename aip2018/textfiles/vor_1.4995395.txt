Lateral movements in Rayleigh–Taylor instabilities due to frontiers. Experimental study
Lateral movements of the fingers in Rayleigh-Taylor hydrodynamic instabilities at the interface between two fluids are studied. We show that transverse movements appear when a physical boundary is present; these phenomena have not been explained until now. The boundary prevents one of the fluids from crossing it. Such frontiers can be buoyancy driven as, for example, the frontier to the passage of a less dense solution through a denser solution or when different aggregation states coexist (liquid and gaseous phases). An experimental study of the lateral movement velocity of the fingers was performed for different Rayleigh numbers (Ra), and when oscillations were detected, their amplitudes were studied. Liquid-liquid (L–L) and gas-liquid (G–L) systems were analysed. Aqueous HCl and Bromocresol Green (sodium salt, NaBCG) solutions were used in L–L experiments, and CO_{2} (gas) and aqueous NaOH, NaHCO_{3}, and CaCl_{2} solutions were employed for the G–L studies. We observed that the lateral movement of the fingers and finger collapses near the interface are more notorious when Ra increases. The consequences of this, for each experience, are a decrease in the number of fingers and an increase in the velocity of the lateral finger movement close to the interface as time evolves. We found that the amplitude of the oscillations did not vary significantly within the considered Ra range. These results have an important implication when determining the wave number of instabilities in an evolving system. The wave number could be strongly diminished if there is a boundary.
I. INTRODUCTION
Hydrodynamic instabilities play a crucial role in many industrial processes and scientific problems. In this work, we addressed Rayleigh–Taylor (RT) instabilities, which are produced when a less dense fluid is put below a denser one. RT instabilities were described in many papers (e.g., Wooding 1969 and Sharp 1984) [1,2]; the presence of chemical reactions that trigger these instabilities extended their interest [3–10]. In particular, characteristic RT patterns were observed when, for example in an autocatalytic reaction, a reaction front moving in the direction of the gravity field can produce an unstable hydrodynamic configuration (see, for example, Yang 2002, Lima 2006, Casado 2007, and Macias 2009) [7–10]. It was also observed that with an initially stable configuration, chemical reactions can lead to instabilities [11–13]. Lately, RT instabilities were reported in studies related to CO_{2} geologic sequestration in deep saline aquifers or oil wells [14–26] and in systems where CO_{2} dissolution is coupled to carbonate precipitation [27,28].
Analysing different experimental configurations we observed that, when the fluids have a physical frontier, transversal finger oscillations to the instability propagation direction were produced near the interface between both fluids (Fig. 1). This frontier can be produced by a sharp density change in the direction of the gravity field, for example, in Liquid–Liquid (L–L) cases [12,13], or because the system is composed of different aggregation states, as for example, in Gas–Liquid (G–L) experiments [22,25]. When the amplitude of the transverse oscillation is greater than the distance between neighboring fingers, this lateral movement produces their collapse, decreasing the wavenumber in that region and possibly increasing the whole system homogenization time. Based on these observations, we performed experimental and numerical [29] studies of the lateral movements of the instabilities observed in the presence of a frontier. A detailed study of speed and amplitude of the lateral oscillatory movement and an analysis of the wavenumber of the RT instabilities as a function of the Rayleigh number (Ra) were done.
II. EXPERIMENTAL
The experiments were carried out in a quasi-two-dimensional vertically oriented system, a Hele-Shaw cell used in previous studies of interfacial pattern formation [11–13,25,30]. In this work, three different cases with a physical frontier are analysed: L–L and G–L with and without precipitate formation. To verify the absence of lateral movements when there is no barrier, an L–L system without a frontier was used. The experiments were recorded with a digital camera (3072 × 2304 pixels). Images were obtained every 20 s (L–L) and every 2 s (G–L) and stored for further analysis. In each case, the experimental setup was conditioned in order to obtain the best images. For L–L and G–L experiments without a precipitate, both with a physical frontier, the Hele Shaw cell was illuminated with transmitted diffuse white light from behind, whereas for the G–L experiments with precipitate formation, a LED light array was placed on the contour of the cell and a black background was used to obtain the images. The Schlieren technique was employed to observe the L–L instabilities without a frontier. For the L–L system, the experimental setup consisted of a Hele–Shaw cell split into upper and lower hemi-cells of Borofloat SCHOTT 1.3 cm thick glass plates (10 cm × 10 cm), with 1.0 mm gap, obtained with a U-shaped polymeric spacer that leaves one side of the hemi-cells open. As the solutions were reactive, we filled each of the hemi-cells with different solutions and brought them into contact through their open sides to trigger the instabilities. The dynamics took place in the space between the plates [11,12] (Fig. 2). For the G–L system, the experimental setup consisted of a closed circular Hele Shaw cell, designed to work with gases as shown in Fig. 3. The cell was built with two 12.0 mm thick and 10.0 cm diameter acrylic plates, with a 1.0 mm gap obtained with a spacer [25,27]. To observe the effects of gas dissolution, during each experiment, a constant gas pressure was held in contact with the aqueous solution filling about half of the cell. To avoid a premature reaction of the gas with the solution during the injection of the aqueous phase, the cell was previously purged and loaded with inert gas (N_{2}); then, the solution was injected with a syringe. Once the solution was in place, N_{2} was replaced by reactive gas to start the experiment. Bromocresol Green was used as a colour indicator to visualize the reactive gas dissolution pattern. In the experiments with precipitate formation, no colour indicator was added; instead, the precipitate solid particles were used as tracers to observe the instability pattern. At the beginning of the precipitation reaction, the particles were small enough to remain at the interface between the two reactive solutions, showing the contour of the fingers. As the precipitate particles became bigger, they began to fall down from the interface [27]. Table I summarizes the analysed experiments.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Figure 4 (Multimedia view) shows the lateral movements and space-time maps of different experiments in which there is a physical frontier. We observed that particle formation does not affect the lateral movement near the G–L interface, giving us a tool to visualize the instabilities without using a pH indicator. For the L–L system in Fig. 4, yellow upwards moving “feathers,” corresponding to the instabilities developed in the upper cell, are observed. The NaBCG solution is denser than the solution in the upper cell (HCl). The feathers exhibit a lateral movement due to the density barrier produced by the presence of NaBCG in the lower cell (orange) [12]. In this case, as the diffusion coefficient of HBCG (the acid form of the color indicator) formed during the neutralization reaction is about ten times smaller than that of HCl, the faster invasion of HCl downwards produces a local density depletion on top of HBCG, and convective cells appear above the initial contact line (see density profiles shown in Figs. 4 and 5 by Kuster et_al [12]). Due to the large density difference, the instabilities produced by this depletion remain localized above the denser yellow HBCG area. They are visualized by the yellow zones that are entrained upwards by convection.
In the G–L systems shown in Fig. 4 with a physical frontier due to different aggregation states, both with or without a precipitate, lateral movements are observed. The displacements can be seen at the G–L interface observing the base of the fingers (see the Multimedia view for movies of the experiments). Space-time maps showing the transverse movement of the fingers were obtained from a sequence of images of 0.033 mm (1 pixel), taken at a specific distance from the interface for each experiment. The space-time maps given in the last row in Fig. 4 show the lateral movements of the fingers over time.
To verify that no transversal movements were observed in an unstable RT system without a physical frontier (the direction of the density gradient of the system is opposite to the direction of the gravity field), a saccharose solution was put on top of distilled water in the same Hele-Shaw cell used in previous L–L experiments. To visualize the instabilities, a Z-type Schlieren setup with two parabolic mirrors (diameter = 20.3 cm and focal length = 74.7 cm), a LED white light source, a knife edge, and a Nikon D5200 camera were used. In this case, as the system is unstable in the gravity field, there is no physical frontier between the hemi-cells, and no lateral movements could be detected in the space-time map. The development of the instabilities over time and the space-time map for this system are shown in Fig. 5. The visualization of this space-time map differs from the previous ones due to the technique used. The bright areas observed in the space-time map correspond to the contour of the fingers. At short times, a bright zone is observed due to the appearance of the fingers. The bright area is widening with the passage of time. Edges of the bright area correspond to the lateral border of each finger. The finger increases or decreases its thickness over time due to convective movements. This widening should not be interpreted as an oscillation of the finger. We suggest that as there is no physical frontier, the solutions can move freely between the cells without producing lateral movements of the fingers.
In order to evaluate the influence of the Rayleigh number (Ra) on the lateral movements in RT instabilities, space-time maps were obtained for L–L and G–L experiments varying the concentrations of the reactants (Fig. 6). Ra was calculated according to the following equation:
where K is the permeability (8.3 × 10^{−8} m^{2}), L_{0} is a characteristic length of the cell (gap width = 0.001 m), g is the gravitational acceleration (9.8 m/s^{2}), Δρ is the density difference between the fluids far from the interface, D is the molecular diffusion coefficient for the respective species (HCl in water, 3.0 × 10^{−9} m^{2}/s, and CO_{2} in water, 2.15 × 10^{−9} m^{2}/s), and μ is the dynamic viscosity (1.005 g/ms). For the L–L system, Δρ is equal to ρ_{HCl} − ρ_{min}, where ρ_{HCl} is the initial density of the upper acid solution (HCl) and ρ_{min} is the minimum density in the upper hemi-cell, extrapolated from the data given by Kuster et_al [12] For the G–L system, Henry's law was used to evaluate the solubility of CO_{2} at the working pressure. Figure 6 shows that when Ra increased, there was an increase in the number of collapses between the fingers near the interface. The fingers joined earlier, diminishing the wave number near the interface, both in L–L or G–L.
A detailed analysis of the velocity and amplitude of the transversal movements of the fingers close to the interface (when there was no finger collapse) for the L–L and G–L (without precipitate) systems was performed using MATLAB programs. The transverse velocity was measured from the space–time maps corresponding to each experiment since we can determine the displacement information (Δy) and the elapsed time (Δt). In order to measure the amplitude (from displacement information Δy) of the oscillations of each experiment, only the fingers in which it is possible to observe at least half cycle of the oscillation in the space–time maps were taken into account. To determine the transverse velocity and amplitude of the oscillation, the average of five experiments was taken for each Ra. Table II shows the chemical composition of the six different L–L and nine G–L systems, indicating the concentration of chemical species that were used for this analysis.
Figure 7 shows dimensionless transverse velocity V of the fingers close to the interface. The transverse velocity is made dimensionless with 4D/L_{0} [29] (D is the molecular diffusion coefficient for the species HCl in water for the L–L system and CO_{2} in water for the G–L system). We observe an increase in the dimensionless transverse velocity with Ra (and thus with Δρ ). These data were obtained varying the concentrations of the fluids. Ra is in the range of 60 to 500 for the L–L system, and 1000 to 3000 for the G–L system. For the L–L system experiments with NaBCG 1 × 10^{−2 }M - HCl 5 × 10^{−3} (Ra = 6.2) and NaBCG 1 × 10^{−2} - HCl 2 × 10^{−2 }M (Ra = 24.6), when Ra is small enough, no instabilities are observed because the diffusive effects are more important than the convective effects. Figure 7 shows that there is a linear relationship between the dimensionless transverse velocity V and Ra, independent of the type of frontier. From the proportionality between V (defined as V = vL_{0}/4D) and Ra (described by Ra = KL_{0}gΔρ/μD), the dimensional transverse velocity v results are proportional to Δρ, and independent of L_{0}/D. On increasing the contrast between the densities, a higher transversal velocity of the fingers is observed. On the other hand, the velocities of both systems follow the same growth law, validating the estimation of Ra for both of them. To calculate Ra for the G–L case, we propose that only the density difference between an aqueous CO_{2} solution and pure water was taken into account because any other chemical species of the system will be present in all the solution (in the region with aqueous CO_{2} and in the region with pure water) without affecting Δρ between both regions. To verify this statement, several aqueous solutions of NaBCG, NaOH, NaHCO_{3}, and NaCl have been used which will be present in the regions with and without aqueous CO_{2}. If our hypothesis is valid, their presence would not affect the density difference and the transversal velocity would be independent of the aqueous solutions. Figure 8 shows that no significant differences in transversal velocities are observed for these solutions. Thus, the use of a pH indicator, as well as the previously used solutions, to visualize the instabilities in the G–L system does not affect its dynamics nor Ra calculus.
Figure 9 shows that the dimensionless amplitude of the oscillations (the amplitude is made dimensionless dividing by L_{0}) is independent of Ra, and thus, it is independent of the density variation of the solutions (the average value of the experimentally amplitude is equal to 1.1 ± 0.1). Instead, when oscillations are produced, their frequency would increase because the transverse velocity increases for the same amplitude (see Figs. 7 and 9).
On the other hand, the wave number for the instabilities of the G–L system was measured at 1.5 mm from the interface at two times: (a) when the instabilities began to develop and (b) at the end of the experiment, when the fingers have collapsed. To do this, Fourier transform was applied to the gray scale profile of the instability images. Figure 10 shows the wave number at the beginning and the end of the experiments. The initial wave number shows a slight increase when Ra increases but, at the end of the experiments, a decreasing trend of the wave number is observed. This decrease in the wave number is produced because with a higher Ra, more fingers collapse due to an increased transverse velocity (Fig. 6). Based on these results, we concluded that as the transverse velocity increases when Ra increases, the wave number at the G–L or L–L interface decreases.
The same phenomenon was observed by Outeda et_al [25] and Wylock et_al [22]: the wave numbers at the interface decrease over time due to the transverse movement of the fingers in this area, but no further explanations were given to this observation. We propose that the existence of a physical frontier is the origin of the transversal movements. As the downwards going fingers in the L–L system or upwards going fingers in G–L systems cannot cross the frontier, they must change their direction when they arrive to this area. This gives rise to a transverse finger movement yielding to oscillations and, when it is possible, to neighboring finger collapse.
On the other hand, if finger transverse diffusion contributes to the homogenization mechanism of the mixture, we suggest that the time it takes to homogenize the mixture will be longer in the area where the wave number is smaller. For example, for the experiment with Ra = 2137 at the fingering front, with a wave number of 2.04 mm^{−1} (Fig. 10), the mixing time will be 28 s with a diffusion coefficient of 2.15 × 10^{−9} m^{2}/s. Instead, for the same experience at the frontier, the collapses reduce the wave number to 0.9 mm^{−1} and the mixing time increases to 143 s. Although these results suggest that it would be possible to obtain systems where fingering could be observed near the interface and a homogeneous mixture could be produced in areas that are far enough from the physical border, we could not experimentally verify this situation, probably due to the limited cell size.
Based on these results, we suggest that in every system with a frontier which prevents the free movement of hydrodynamic instabilities (originating from the displacement of a fluid of lower mobility by one with higher mobility, as in the case of viscous fingering [31] or of a change in permeability in a porous medium [32]), lateral movements of the fingers could be expected, with a consequent decrease in the wave number in that area. All the experimental results given in this work are verified numerically by Fernández et_al [29] We show experimentally that the lateral movement velocity of the fingers increases linearly when Ra increases: this was tested experimentally for 60 < Ra < 2200 which matches with the numerical results found by Fernández et_al for 800 < Ra < 2700. For example, for Ra ∼ 1336, the value of the dimensionless transverse velocity obtained experimentally is V_{exp} = 0.88 ± 0.08 and the value obtained numerically is V_{num} = 0.83, which is within the experimental error. The slopes obtained experimentally and numerically are m_{exp} = (8.1 ± 0.2) × 10^{−4} and m_{num} = (7.9 ± 0.3) × 10^{−4}, respectively. On the other hand, although an experimental value of the dimensionless amplitude of the oscillations was obtained, when they are produced, A_{exp} ∼ 1 which differs from the numerical value by 50% (A_{num} ∼ 1.5), both seem to be independent of the variations in Ra. With respect to the initial dimensionless wave number (k_{0}), we can observe that the experimental and the numerical results increase from 1.5 to 2.5 when Ra increases for both of them. The wave number after collapse (k_{f}) decreases between values 1.75 and 0.25 for both results.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
We have shown that the presence of a physical frontier gives rise to transverse movements of the fingers. The origin of these movements was not explained until now. These transverse movements could produce collapse of neighboring fingers and the decrease in the wave number of the instability during its development. We have verified that transversal velocity of the fingers is higher when Ra increases, producing finger collapse at shorter times. The evolution of the wave number will be affected by the presence of a frontier, independent of its origin. In the study by Fernández et_al [29], we show numerically this behavior for Liquid–Liquid, Gas–Liquid, or Solid–Liquid systems.
Density driven instabilities (Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities) are formed when a denser fluid is put on top of a less dense fluid. This triggers fingering in both the upper and lower fluids. In this paper, we show experimentally that in Rayleigh–Taylor instabilities, transverse movements of the fingers appear close to the interface between two fluids when a physical boundary is present. The boundaries are buoyancy driven for liquid-liquid systems and the gas-liquid interface. The experiments were carried out in a quasi-two-dimensional vertically oriented system, the so-called Hele-Shaw cell that allows fluid flow between two parallel flat plates separated by a small gap. Three different cases with a physical frontier are analysed: Liquid–Liquid and Gas–Liquid with and without precipitate formation. To verify the absence of lateral movements when there are no barriers, a Liquid–Liquid system without a frontier was used. An experimental study of the lateral finger velocity is performed for the density difference between both fluids (different Rayleigh numbers). This is a general situation: when a physical barrier is present, lateral movements and, eventually, finger collapses near the interface appear. Since the fingers cannot cross as there is a frontier, they must change their direction when they arrive to this area. The collapses are more notorious when the density difference increases. As a consequence, there is a decrease in the number of fingers close to the interface as time evolves. If finger transverse diffusion contributes to the homogenization mechanism of the mixture, we suggest that the time it takes to homogenize the mixture will be longer in the area where the wave number is smaller.
In case the oscillations are detected, their amplitudes are analysed. We have found that the oscillation amplitudes are independent of the density variation of the solutions.
We propose that the existence of a physical frontier is the origin of the transversal movements.
Hydrodynamic instabilities play a crucial role in many industrial processes and scientific problems. In this work, we addressed Rayleigh–Taylor (RT) instabilities, which are produced when a less dense fluid is put below a denser one. RT instabilities were described in many papers (e.g., Wooding 1969 and Sharp 1984) [1,2]; the presence of chemical reactions that trigger these instabilities extended their interest [3–10]. In particular, characteristic RT patterns were observed when, for example in an autocatalytic reaction, a reaction front moving in the direction of the gravity field can produce an unstable hydrodynamic configuration (see, for example, Yang 2002, Lima 2006, Casado 2007, and Macias 2009) [7–10]. It was also observed that with an initially stable configuration, chemical reactions can lead to instabilities [11–13]. Lately, RT instabilities were reported in studies related to CO_{2} geologic sequestration in deep saline aquifers or oil wells [14–26] and in systems where CO_{2} dissolution is coupled to carbonate precipitation [27,28].
Analysing different experimental configurations we observed that, when the fluids have a physical frontier, transversal finger oscillations to the instability propagation direction were produced near the interface between both fluids (Fig. 1). This frontier can be produced by a sharp density change in the direction of the gravity field, for example, in Liquid–Liquid (L–L) cases [12,13], or because the system is composed of different aggregation states, as for example, in Gas–Liquid (G–L) experiments [22,25]. When the amplitude of the transverse oscillation is greater than the distance between neighboring fingers, this lateral movement produces their collapse, decreasing the wavenumber in that region and possibly increasing the whole system homogenization time. Based on these observations, we performed experimental and numerical [29] studies of the lateral movements of the instabilities observed in the presence of a frontier. A detailed study of speed and amplitude of the lateral oscillatory movement and an analysis of the wavenumber of the RT instabilities as a function of the Rayleigh number (Ra) were done.
The experiments were carried out in a quasi-two-dimensional vertically oriented system, a Hele-Shaw cell used in previous studies of interfacial pattern formation [11–13,25,30]. In this work, three different cases with a physical frontier are analysed: L–L and G–L with and without precipitate formation. To verify the absence of lateral movements when there is no barrier, an L–L system without a frontier was used. The experiments were recorded with a digital camera (3072 × 2304 pixels).

As the solutions were reactive, we filled each of the hemi-cells with different solutions and brought them into contact through their open sides to trigger the instabilities. The dynamics took place in the space between the plates [11,12] (Fig. 2). For the G–L system, the experimental setup consisted of a closed circular Hele Shaw cell, designed to work with gases as shown in Fig. 3. The cell was built with two 12.0 mm thick and 10.0 cm diameter acrylic plates, with a 1.0 mm gap obtained with a spacer [25,27]. To observe the effects of gas dissolution, during each experiment, a constant gas pressure was held in contact with the aqueous solution filling about half of the cell. To avoid a premature reaction of the gas with the solution during the injection of the aqueous phase, the cell was previously purged and loaded with inert gas (N_{2}); then, the solution was injected with a syringe. Once the solution was in place, N_{2} was replaced by reactive gas to start the experiment. Bromocresol Green was used as a colour indicator to visualize the reactive gas dissolution pattern. In the experiments with precipitate formation, no colour indicator was added; instead, the precipitate solid particles were used as tracers to observe the instability pattern. At the beginning of the precipitation reaction, the particles were small enough to remain at the interface between the two reactive solutions, showing the contour of the fingers. As the precipitate particles became bigger, they began to fall down from the interface [27]. Table I summarizes the analysed experiments.
Figure 4 (Multimedia view) shows the lateral movements and space-time maps of different experiments in which there is a physical frontier. We observed that particle formation does not affect the lateral movement near the G–L interface, giving us a tool to visualize the instabilities without using a pH indicator. For the L–L system in Fig. 4, yellow upwards moving “feathers,” corresponding to the instabilities developed in the upper cell, are observed. The NaBCG solution is denser than the solution in the upper cell (HCl). The feathers exhibit a lateral movement due to the density barrier produced by the presence of NaBCG in the lower cell (orange) [12]. In this case, as the diffusion coefficient of HBCG (the acid form of the color indicator) formed during the neutralization reaction is about ten times smaller than that of HCl, the faster invasion of HCl downwards produces a local density depletion on top of HBCG, and convective cells appear above the initial contact line (see density profiles shown in Figs. 4 and 5 by Kuster et_al [12]). Due to the large density difference, the instabilities produced by this depletion remain localized above the denser yellow HBCG area. They are visualized by the yellow zones that are entrained upwards by convection.
In the G–L systems shown in Fig. 4 with a physical frontier due to different aggregation states, both with or without a precipitate, lateral movements are observed. The displacements can be seen at the G–L interface observing the base of the fingers (see the Multimedia view for movies of the experiments). Space-time maps showing the transverse movement of the fingers were obtained from a sequence of images of 0.033 mm (1 pixel), taken at a specific distance from the interface for each experiment. The space-time maps given in the last row in Fig. 4 show the lateral movements of the fingers over time.
To verify that no transversal movements were observed in an unstable RT system without a physical frontier (the direction of the density gradient of the system is opposite to the direction of the gravity field), a saccharose solution was put on top of distilled water in the same Hele-Shaw cell used in previous L–L experiments. To visualize the instabilities, a Z-type Schlieren setup with two parabolic mirrors (diameter = 20.3 cm and focal length = 74.7 cm), a LED white light source, a knife edge, and a Nikon D5200 camera were used. In this case, as the system is unstable in the gravity field, there is no physical frontier between the hemi-cells, and no lateral movements could be detected in the space-time map. The development of the instabilities over time and the space-time map for this system are shown in Fig. 5. The visualization of this space-time map differs from the previous ones due to the technique used. The bright areas observed in the space-time map correspond to the contour of the fingers. At short times, a bright zone is observed due to the appearance of the fingers. The bright area is widening with the passage of time. Edges of the bright area correspond to the lateral border of each finger. The finger increases or decreases its thickness over time due to convective movements. This widening should not be interpreted as an oscillation of the finger. We suggest that as there is no physical frontier, the solutions can move freely between the cells without producing lateral movements of the fingers.
In order to evaluate the influence of the Rayleigh number (Ra) on the lateral movements in RT instabilities, space-time maps were obtained for L–L and G–L experiments varying the concentrations of the reactants (Fig. 6). Ra was calculated according to the following equation:
where K is the permeability (8.3 × 10^{−8} m^{2}), L_{0} is a characteristic length of the cell (gap width = 0.001 m), g is the gravitational acceleration (9.8 m/s^{2}), Δρ is the density difference between the fluids far from the interface, D is the molecular diffusion coefficient for the respective species (HCl in water, 3.0 × 10^{−9} m^{2}/s, and CO_{2} in water, 2.15 × 10^{−9} m^{2}/s), and μ is the dynamic viscosity (1.005 g/ms). For the L–L system, Δρ is equal to ρ_{HCl} − ρ_{min}, where ρ_{HCl} is the initial density of the upper acid solution (HCl) and ρ_{min} is the minimum density in the upper hemi-cell, extrapolated from the data given by Kuster et_al [12] For the G–L system, Henry's law was used to evaluate the solubility of CO_{2} at the working pressure. Figure 6 shows that when Ra increased, there was an increase in the number of collapses between the fingers near the interface. The fingers joined earlier, diminishing the wave number near the interface, both in L–L or G–L.
A detailed analysis of the velocity and amplitude of the transversal movements of the fingers close to the interface (when there was no finger collapse) for the L–L and G–L (without precipitate) systems was performed using MATLAB programs. The transverse velocity was measured from the space–time maps corresponding to each experiment since we can determine the displacement information (Δy) and the elapsed time (Δt). In order to measure the amplitude (from displacement information Δy) of the oscillations of each experiment, only the fingers in which it is possible to observe at least half cycle of the oscillation in the space–time maps were taken into account. To determine the transverse velocity and amplitude of the oscillation, the average of five experiments was taken for each Ra. Table II shows the chemical composition of the six different L–L and nine G–L systems, indicating the concentration of chemical species that were used for this analysis.
Figure 7 shows dimensionless transverse velocity V of the fingers close to the interface. The transverse velocity is made dimensionless with 4D/L_{0} [29] (D is the molecular diffusion coefficient for the species HCl in water for the L–L system and CO_{2} in water for the G–L system). We observe an increase in the dimensionless transverse velocity with Ra (and thus with Δρ ). These data were obtained varying the concentrations of the fluids. Ra is in the range of 60 to 500 for the L–L system, and 1000 to 3000 for the G–L system. For the L–L system experiments with NaBCG 1 × 10^{−2 }M - HCl 5 × 10^{−3} (Ra = 6.2) and NaBCG 1 × 10^{−2} - HCl 2 × 10^{−2 }M (Ra = 24.6), when Ra is small enough, no instabilities are observed because the diffusive effects are more important than the convective effects. Figure 7 shows that there is a linear relationship between the dimensionless transverse velocity V and Ra, independent of the type of frontier. From the proportionality between V (defined as V = vL_{0}/4D) and Ra (described by Ra = KL_{0}gΔρ/μD), the dimensional transverse velocity v results are proportional to Δρ, and independent of L_{0}/D. On increasing the contrast between the densities, a higher transversal velocity of the fingers is observed. On the other hand, the velocities of both systems follow the same growth law, validating the estimation of Ra for both of them. To calculate Ra for the G–L case, we propose that only the density difference between an aqueous CO_{2} solution and pure water was taken into account because any other chemical species of the system will be present in all the solution (in the region with aqueous CO_{2} and in the region with pure water) without affecting Δρ between both regions. To verify this statement, several aqueous solutions of NaBCG, NaOH, NaHCO_{3}, and NaCl have been used which will be present in the regions with and without aqueous CO_{2}. If our hypothesis is valid, their presence would not affect the density difference and the transversal velocity would be independent of the aqueous solutions. Figure 8 shows that no significant differences in transversal velocities are observed for these solutions. Thus, the use of a pH indicator, as well as the previously used solutions, to visualize the instabilities in the G–L system does not affect its dynamics nor Ra calculus.
Figure 9 shows that the dimensionless amplitude of the oscillations (the amplitude is made dimensionless dividing by L_{0}) is independent of Ra, and thus, it is independent of the density variation of the solutions (the average value of the experimentally amplitude is equal to 1.1 ± 0.1). Instead, when oscillations are produced, their frequency would increase because the transverse velocity increases for the same amplitude (see Figs. 7 and 9).
On the other hand, the wave number for the instabilities of the G–L system was measured at 1.5 mm from the interface at two times: (a) when the instabilities began to develop and (b) at the end of the experiment, when the fingers have collapsed. To do this, Fourier transform was applied to the gray scale profile of the instability images. Figure 10 shows the wave number at the beginning and the end of the experiments. The initial wave number shows a slight increase when Ra increases but, at the end of the experiments, a decreasing trend of the wave number is observed. This decrease in the wave number is produced because with a higher Ra, more fingers collapse due to an increased transverse velocity (Fig. 6). Based on these results, we concluded that as the transverse velocity increases when Ra increases, the wave number at the G–L or L–L interface decreases.
The same phenomenon was observed by Outeda et_al [25] and Wylock et_al [22]: the wave numbers at the interface decrease over time due to the transverse movement of the fingers in this area, but no further explanations were given to this observation. We propose that the existence of a physical frontier is the origin of the transversal movements. As the downwards going fingers in the L–L system or upwards going fingers in G–L systems cannot cross the frontier, they must change their direction when they arrive to this area. This gives rise to a transverse finger movement yielding to oscillations and, when it is possible, to neighboring finger collapse.
On the other hand, if finger transverse diffusion contributes to the homogenization mechanism of the mixture, we suggest that the time it takes to homogenize the mixture will be longer in the area where the wave number is smaller. For example, for the experiment with Ra = 2137 at the fingering front, with a wave number of 2.04 mm^{−1} (Fig. 10), the mixing time will be 28 s with a diffusion coefficient of 2.15 × 10^{−9} m^{2}/s. Instead, for the same experience at the frontier, the collapses reduce the wave number to 0.9 mm^{−1} and the mixing time increases to 143 s. Although these results suggest that it would be possible to obtain systems where fingering could be observed near the interface and a homogeneous mixture could be produced in areas that are far enough from the physical border, we could not experimentally verify this situation, probably due to the limited cell size.
Based on these results, we suggest that in every system with a frontier which prevents the free movement of hydrodynamic instabilities (originating from the displacement of a fluid of lower mobility by one with higher mobility, as in the case of viscous fingering [31] or of a change in permeability in a porous medium [32]), lateral movements of the fingers could be expected, with a consequent decrease in the wave number in that area. All the experimental results given in this work are verified numerically by Fernández et_al [29] We show experimentally that the lateral movement velocity of the fingers increases linearly when Ra increases: this was tested experimentally for 60 < Ra < 2200 which matches with the numerical results found by Fernández et_al for 800 < Ra < 2700. For example, for Ra ∼ 1336, the value of the dimensionless transverse velocity obtained experimentally is V_{exp} = 0.88 ± 0.08 and the value obtained numerically is V_{num} = 0.83, which is within the experimental error. The slopes obtained experimentally and numerically are m_{exp} = (8.1 ± 0.2) × 10^{−4} and m_{num} = (7.9 ± 0.3) × 10^{−4}, respectively. On the other hand, although an experimental value of the dimensionless amplitude of the oscillations was obtained, when they are produced, A_{exp} ∼ 1 which differs from the numerical value by 50% (A_{num} ∼ 1.5), both seem to be independent of the variations in Ra. With respect to the initial dimensionless wave number (k_{0}), we can observe that the experimental and the numerical results increase from 1.5 to 2.5 when Ra increases for both of them. The wave number after collapse (k_{f}) decreases between values 1.75 and 0.25 for both results.
We have shown that the presence of a physical frontier gives rise to transverse movements of the fingers. The origin of these movements was not explained until now. These transverse movements could produce collapse of neighboring fingers and the decrease in the wave number of the instability during its development. We have verified that transversal velocity of the fingers is higher when Ra increases, producing finger collapse at shorter times. The evolution of the wave number will be affected by the presence of a frontier, independent of its origin. In the study by Fernández et_al [29], we show numerically this behavior for Liquid–Liquid, Gas–Liquid, or Solid–Liquid systems.
