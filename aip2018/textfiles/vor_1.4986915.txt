Quantum mechanical free energy profiles with post-quantization restraints: Binding free energy of the water dimer over a broad range of temperatures
Free energy calculations are a crucial part of understanding chemical systems but are often computationally expensive for all but the simplest of systems. Various enhanced sampling techniques have been developed to improve the efficiency of these calculations in numerical simulations. However, the majority of these approaches have been applied using classical molecular dynamics. There are many situations where nuclear quantum effects impact the system of interest and a classical description fails to capture these details. In this work, path integral molecular dynamics has been used in conjunction with umbrella sampling, and it has been observed that correct results are only obtained when the umbrella sampling potential is applied to a single path integral bead post quantization. This method has been validated against a Lennard-Jones benchmark system before being applied to the more complicated water dimer system over a broad range of temperatures. Free energy profiles are obtained, and these are utilized in the calculation of the second virial coefficient as well as the change in free energy from the separated water monomers to the dimer. Comparisons to experimental and ground state calculation values from the literature are made for the second virial coefficient at higher temperature and the dissociation energy of the dimer in the ground state.
I. INTRODUCTION
Free energies of chemical systems are some of the most useful quantities in computational chemistry but are often extremely difficult to obtain. Numerical methods such as molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations have provided a way to calculate free energy using the statistical mechanics relationship between the canonical partition function and the Helmholtz free energy of the system [1]. These methods are generally used to calculate the difference in free energy between an initial configuration and a final configuration of the system instead of the absolute free energy of a particular state of the system. For these methods to work, it is critical that the configuration space between the initial and final configuration is well sampled to ensure an accurate distribution is obtained. The configuration space between initial and final configurations is often difficult to sample using traditional Boltzmann weighted sampling due to energy barriers, and many non-Boltzmann techniques have been developed to enhance the sampling of these configurations including umbrella sampling [2,3] and metadynamics [4,5]. These non-Boltzmann techniques typically add some potential to bias the simulation in order to fully explore configuration space.
These non-Boltzmann sampling techniques were initially developed with the intended use in classical molecular dynamics, but there are many systems that are very quantum in nature that would benefit from these enhanced sampling techniques. A commonly used method to account for these nuclear quantum effects in simulation is the introduction of Feynman path integrals [6]. Specifically, the path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) [7,8] technique using the path integral Langevin equation (PILE) thermostat has been shown to accurately account for the nuclear quantum effects present in simulation [9–11]. Previous work has been done combining ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) with the Bennet-Chandler method to calculate rate coefficients using umbrella integration [12–14]. Earlier work has also been done using Feynman path integrals and umbrella sampling that was focused on the calculation of the centroid potential of mean force [15,16]. It should be noted that the centroid of a Feynman path and the actual quantum mechanical position observable are very different quantities. For example, the centroid and real space radial distribution functions of a quantum fluid may differ greatly but can nevertheless be related to one another via a deconvolution procedure [17]. In some situations such as the calculation of quantum mechanical rate constants, the centroid can be the quantity of interest. The inclusion of quantum mechanical effects due to vibration has also been considered in the calculation of reactive potentials of mean force by Gao, Truhlar, and co-workers [18]. Further studies on the inclusion of quantum mechanical effects in reactive free energy profiles have also combined path integral and umbrella sampling techniques, but these methods again use the centroid of the path [19,20]. In addition to these path integral based methods, umbrella sampling has also been utilized in conjunction with wavefunction based methods in order to improve sampling [21,22].
The work presented here studies the quantum effects present in weakly bound complexes using path integral molecular dynamics with umbrella sampling applied directly to path integral beads as opposed to the centroid path integrals. We have used the PILE thermostat and applied the umbrella sampling biasing potential to a single bead of the ring polymer as opposed to the centroid or all of the beads of the ring polymer in order to obtain free energy profiles using the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) [23]. Additionally, we have optimized the parameters of the umbrella sampling biasing potential and the centroid friction parameter of the PILE thermostat to efficiently obtain free energy profiles. The methodology is first tested on the Lennard-Jones benchmark system that can be solved exactly before continuing onto the water dimer system.
Water dimers are believed to play a role in the larger than expected absorption of solar radiation in the atmosphere [24–27]. Traditional Boltzmann weighted simulations of the water dimer at atmospheric conditions are not possible due to the relatively weak interaction between the water molecules compared with the kinetic energy of the system. Additionally, we have studied the water dimer at temperatures much lower than typical atmospheric conditions to study the impact of nuclear quantum effects in the system. We present results that use traditional point charge models such as q-SPC/Fw [28] and q-TIP4P/F [29] as well as a more complicated ab initio derived potential, MB-pol [30,31]. The free energy profiles of the water dimer have been calculated and used to calculate the second virial coefficient of the system as well as the difference in free energy between separated water monomers and the dimer. The layout of this paper is as follows: Sec. II outlines the requisite theory for this work, Sec. III describes the computational details and presents results, while Sec. IV provides concluding remarks.
II. THEORY AND METHODS
For a composite dimer system, a general Hamiltonian can be written in the form,
where ĥ_{i} is the Hamiltonian associated with subsystem i and V^{12} is the interaction potential between the two monomers. The monomer Hamiltonian is
where k^{i} and v^{i} are, respectively, the kinetic and intramolecular potential energy of monomer i. The quantum mechanical partition function of a monomer i is Z_{m}≡Z_{i}=Tre^{−βĥi}, while that for the dimer is Z_{d}=Tre^{−βĤ} where β=1/k_{B}T. The Helmholtz free energy difference between the dimer and monomers is
One object of importance for the calculation of the above free energy difference is the reduced density matrix of the system for a given bi-partitioning. For dimer free energy profiles, a natural choice is the partitioning between a reaction coordinate denoted by q and the remainder of the degrees of freedom denoted by Q. The reduced density operator is then readily obtained by partially tracing over the Hilbert space associated with the Q degrees of freedom,
The reaction coordinate q can be chosen such that the interaction potential V_{12}(q, Q) vanishes for sufficiently large values of q. In this limit, the density operator factorizes into a product of monomer contributions.
Matrix elements of ρ^{q} can be conveniently calculated using path integral techniques. Note that special methods are required to calculate properties that depend on off-diagonal elements ⟨q|ρ^{q}|q^{′}⟩ of the reduced density operator. For example, the “replica trick” can be used to obtain entanglement measures in bipartite quantum systems [32,33], and these methods have recently been used for the first study entanglement in liquid helium using path integral ground state sampling [34]. We will restrict ourselves to the diagonal elements, ⟨q|ρ^{q}|q⟩, here as those are directly related to free energy profiles.
A. Path integral representation
The discretized path integral formulation [6] can be used to represent the trace involved in the calculation of the partition function of a dimer,
with the boundary condition P + 1 = 1 and where
is the high temperature density matrix for τ=β/P with the free propagator ρ_{0}(R_{i},R_{i+1})=⟨R_{i}|e^{−τK^}|R_{i+1}⟩. The primitive symmetric Trotter factorization is used to represent ρ_{τ}(R_{i},R_{i+1}) above. The coordinates {R_{i}} are referred to as beads in the language of discretized path integrals. Diagonal elements of the full thermal density matrix are obtained by omitting the first integral of R_{1},
for a finite number of beads P. As introduced earlier, the object of interest for the calculation of quantum mechanical free energy profiles along a reaction coordinate q is the diagonal reduced density matrix,
where P^{q}=qq⊗I^{Q} is a projection operator that selects a particular value q of the reaction coordinate. We note that this projection operator is the identity in the Hilbert space associated with the Q degrees of freedom. In the path integral representation, this reduced density matrix is
where {q, Q_{1}} represents the partitioning of coordinate R_{1} into constant q and variable Q_{1} parts. Note that the imaginary propagator between beads 1 and 2 and beads P and 1 is different from the other time slices in the exact path integral expression for ρ_{q}(q) above. It should also be noted that the first and last time slices were used in this analysis, but any other adjacent time slices would have been equally valid due to the path integral being a closed ring. The accurate calculation of ρ_{q}(q) over a broad range of temperatures using path integral techniques is the main objective of the current work.
B. Umbrella sampling and post quantization restraints
The manner in which umbrella sampling is introduced into this formalism is critical in order to be able to unbias the simulation data that come from the numerical sampling of the path integral. Consider the biased Hamiltonian that is required for umbrella sampling,
where V^{bias} is the unphysical umbrella sampling potential that forces the system to explore regions of phase space that an unbiased simulation may not explore within a simulation. In the path integral representation, the biased partition function of the dimer system may be defined as
where the imaginary type propagator associated with the biased partition function is
This Zdbias is a partition function that is conducive to numerical sampling, but it rapidly becomes impractical to unbias simulations due to the fact that the number of biasing terms grows with P, the number of beads. Using an unbiasing procedure such as WHAM becomes unstable when there are more than a few biasing terms present, and this prescription may lead to hundreds of biasing terms.
Consider an alternative definition for this biased partition function of the form,
We term this biased partition function a Post Quantization Restraint (PQR) since it does not use a biasing operator as in Eq. (11) but rather utilizes a classical-like restraining function after quantization in the path integral representation. This is analogous to the post quantization constraint technique used to justify the use of classical constraint methodologies for path integrals [35,36]. This definition of the biased partition function introduces a biasing term on a single bead as opposed to the previous definition where the number of biasing terms grew with the number of path integral beads present in the system. It is important to note that the exponential in the biasing term is not divided by P such that β/P=τ in the way that the exponential is split for ρ_{τ}. As such, it may be simpler to multiply V_{bias} by P for some PIMD implementations that scale all potential interactions by dividing P.
The major advantage of this prescription is that when the unbiasing is performed, there is only a single biasing term, and the method of WHAM may be used just like a classical umbrella sampling simulation. However, the symmetry of the path integral has been broken by applying this biasing potential to only a single bead and thus restricts the amount of data gathered from molecular dynamics as only the information about the biased bead may be used in data analysis. This limitation is strictly one of efficiency and one that can be minimized by optimizing the parameters present within the PILE thermostat and the umbrella sampling biasing potentials.
The only additional parameter introduced by the PILE thermostat is the centroid friction parameter, γ_{0} as the friction parameters for the higher order modes are analytically obtained within the PILE thermostat to be twice the frequency of the uncoupled harmonic oscillator for each higher order mode [9–11]. Typically, γ_{0}=1/τ_{0}, where τ_{0} specifies the thermostat time constant for the centroid mode for some property. The optimal choice of τ_{0} provides the smallest autocorrelation time for the property of interest in simulation and ensures that the exploration of phase space is most rapid. One way to obtain a reasonable τ_{0} is to perform a microcanonical simulation of the system and observe the decay of the autocorrelation function for some property of interest. The optimal τ_{0} is obtained from the amount of time it takes for the autocorrelation function of that centroid observable to decay. In practice, simulation parameters such as the number of beads, the temperature of the system, and the potential energy of the system all impact the optimal choice of τ_{0} and γ_{0}.
Umbrella sampling adds additional parameters to each simulation window in the form of a biasing potential. A typical biasing potential for umbrella sampling is the harmonic oscillator,
where k is the force constant for the harmonic potential, q(R) is the reaction coordinate as a function of the system coordinates, and q_{eq} is the equilibrium value for the reaction coordinate. For each umbrella sampling window, the value of q_{eq} is modified to explore a different region of phase space along the respective reaction coordinate. The umbrella sampling performed in this work will define the reaction coordinate to be the centre of mass distance between either atoms or molecules, respectively. The key part is that for every combination of simulation parameters including the number of beads, temperature, k and q_{eq}, the optimal centroid friction parameter may change. In order to reduce the amount of simulation to optimize these parameters, an assumption will be made based on the optimal friction parameters for the higher order modes used in the PILE thermostat. Specifically, an assumption will be made that the optimal centroid friction may be calculated to be twice the frequency of the umbrella sampling biasing potential in an analogous fashion to the higher order modes of the PILE thermostat. The validity of this assumption will be tested alongside the complete analysis of the umbrella sampling and WHAM procedures.
III. COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS AND RESULTS
Before progressing to the more complicated water dimer system, we have studied a simpler case composed of two argon or neon atoms with a Lennard-Jones type interaction potential. Such a system may be solved exactly using matrix multiplication to discretize the path integral as done by Berne and Thirumalai [37]. The exact results provide a benchmark to which the umbrella sampling with path integrals may be compared to directly. Calculations were performed using the PILE implementation [38] of the Molecular Modelling Toolkit (MMTK) [39].
A. A simple illustrative example: Ar_{2} and Ne_{2}
The results of the argon and neon dimer calculations are shown in Fig. 1 using distinguishable atoms. The exact classical and quantum results are obtained directly for Ar_{2} and Ne_{2} using a Lennard-Jones potential (𝜖=120K,σ=3.4Å for Ar, 𝜖=36.8K,σ=2.789Å for Ne) and the discretization scheme of Berne and Thirumalai [37]. The classical umbrella sampling simulations agree with the exact classical result. For the quantum umbrella sampling, 512 beads were used alongside either 512 biasing potentials (one for each bead) or a single biasing potential acting on a single bead. The centre of mass distance between the atoms at decorrelated time steps was then provided to WHAM where the 512 biasing potentials were assumed to only be a single biasing potential for the R = 512 data. We have only performed simulations up to 512 beads and more beads would be required to converge for Ne_{2} at lower temperatures. However, for the present work, 512 beads were sufficient to display the reliability and accuracy of this method. Note that the US_{P=512,R=512} results correspond to the centroid potential of mean force [40], a quantity that is far different from the quantum mechanical free energy obtained from the logarithm of the diagonal density matrix. This has been illustrated by one of us in the case of liquid parahydrogen where the use of the centroid radial distribution function lead to erroneous interpretation of neutron scattering experiments [17]. As illustrated in Fig. 1, only the simulations that were done with a single biasing potential (US_{P=512,R=1}) were able to correctly reproduce the exact quantum results. The final dataset in this plot is the monomer data that were calculated using the same methodology used to calculate the second virial coefficients in the development of the MB-pol potential [30]. For these results, thermally distributed ring polymer configurations of each argon monomer were generated using path integral molecular dynamics, and decorrelated configurations of the monomers were placed at a specific distance from each other in random orientations with respect to each other. Monte Carlo integration was then performed using these configurations as a distribution and the free energy profile can be built by performing the thermal average of the Mayer function. Full details of this method can be found in the referenced work [30]. This method reduces to a classical Monte Carlo simulation along the centre of mass distance between argons and the quantum mechanical behaviour occurs along this reaction coordinate. It should be noted that when this method is used for more complicated systems, such as the water dimer, it captures the quantum mechanical behaviour of the monomers and works well at higher temperatures.
As a further test of this methodology, the free energy profiles were used to calculate the second virial coefficient and difference in free energy, ΔA. The full details of this calculation are described in Secs. III B 3 and III B 4. The various methodologies presented in Fig. 1 are compared within Table I to the zero temperature classical result, 𝜖_{LJ} and the quantum dissociation energy, D_{0}, which was obtained by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian for the dimer using the Lennard-Jones potential. These calculations were performed at 1 K where the matrix multiplication results of ΔAcexact and ΔAqexact approach the zero temperature expectation of 𝜖_{LJ} and D_{0}, respectively. The quantum US results utilizing a single biasing potential, ΔAP=512R=1, more accurately captured the behaviour of D_{0} than the many biasing potential results of ΔAP=512R=512. These results have illustrated the accuracy of this methodology and allow its use on more complicated systems of interest.
B. Water dimer
The water dimer system was a practical application for this methodology, and it has been studied thoroughly both through experiment and theory [41]. At high temperatures, the water dimer would simply dissociate without some sort of biasing present and at lower temperatures, the long range tail will be difficult to explore without biasing present. As such, it is a perfect candidate for studying the effectiveness of umbrella sampling.
1. Simulation parameters
We wanted to verify the effectiveness of our assumption for the choice of centroid friction before presenting the free energy profiles of the water dimer. To this end, we performed an analysis of the time required to obtain decorrelated, independent data points as a function of γ^{0} for the q-SPC/Fw and q-TIP4P/F water models at temperatures of 100, 200, and 300 K. This analysis was done using 32 path integral beads by running canonical simulations with the PILE thermostat while the γ^{0} parameter was varied by orders of magnitude. The distance between the centres of mass of the water molecules was outputted from simulation in order to generate the autocorrelation function of this quantity. The decay of the autocorrelation function provides a measure of the length of time between non-correlated data points in simulation, and the results of these simulations are provided in Fig. 2. These simulations were performed using an umbrella sampling force constant of k = 1000 kJ mol^{−1} nm^{−2}, equilibrium positions of 3, 5, and 8 Å, and the biasing potential was only applied to a single path integral bead. Based on a force constant of k = 1000 kJ mol^{−1} nm^{−2}, our assumption is that the optimal γ^{0} should be 20 ps^{−1}. This assumption of γ^{0} = 20 ps^{−1} does provide a reasonable decorrelation time but increasing or decreasing γ^{0} by an order of magnitude seems to have minimal effect. Additionally, we have observed from a similar analysis that the decorrelation time is more sensitive to the choice of γ^{0} when the biasing potential is applied to all of the path integral beads due to the fact that γ^{0} is applied to the centroid mode and not simply a single bead.
The rest of the calculations presented in this work were done using γ^{0} = 20 ps^{−1} based on the umbrella sampling force constant and the next results are the free energy profiles for the water dimer as a function of centre of mass separation. We performed simulations for the q-SPC/Fw, q-TIP4P/F, and MB-pol models over a temperature range of 10–300 K as well as with a range of path integral beads from 1 to 512 using a biasing potential on a single bead. The simulations were run for an equilibration period of 1 ns for every set of parameters before beginning a 10 ns simulation using a time step of 0.1 fs. The centre of mass distance between the water molecules was outputted after the requisite number of decorrelation steps from these simulations. An implementation of WHAM from Grossfield [42] was then used to generate a free energy profile from the centre of mass distances obtained from simulation for each set of parameters.
2. From the classical limit down to the quantum regime
Free energy profiles for 10 and 200 K using the MB-pol potential are displayed in Fig. 3 using this WHAM analysis with 512 path integral beads for the quantum results. Additionally, classical rigid monomer MC simulations were performed to study the impact of constraining the internal degrees of freedom of each water molecule. The classical rigid MC approach of Ref [43] was used.
These two temperatures were chosen to illustrate the importance of quantum effects as the temperature is lowered. At 200 K, the shapes of the free energy profiles are similar and the classical and quantum depths are close for all water models studied. Closer inspection at 200 K illustrates that constraining the geometry of the monomer did not improve much on the classical results of the MB-pol model. It should be noted that the rigid simulations provided a reasonable approximation to the quantum result at this temperature for the q-SPC/Fw and q-TIP4P/F models. The monomer data in Fig. 3 were obtained using the methodology previously discussed and used by Babin et_al in the development of the MB-pol potential [30]. The benefit of this method is that biasing potentials are not required at high temperature to keep the water dimer together. The drawback of this method is that only calculating the path configurations of individual water molecules loses the quantum mechanical behaviour along the reaction coordinate. This becomes a critical approximation as the temperature is lowered but works reasonably well in the 200 K regime, as illustrated in Fig. 3.
The major differences in Fig. 3 are at 10 K where the difference between quantum and classical as well as the differences between simulation methods are observed in both the shape and depth of the well. All of the methods except the quantum umbrella sampling method display a similar shape as before with varying well depths. Alternatively, the quantum umbrella sampling method provides a much wider and deeper well as compared with the quantum monomer simulations. The widening of the free energy profile is an expected occurrence as the system becomes more quantum in nature and has been observed in Lennard-Jones interactions previously [37]. It should also be noted that obtaining these free energy profiles at 10 K became increasingly difficult as the individual window distributions became very peaked. These sharp distributions are problematic as the WHAM algorithm requires an overlap between adjacent windows, thus requiring the separation between windows to be decreased from 0.5 Å to 0.1 Å to ensure sufficient overlap. The smallest and largest q_{eq} used were, respectively, 2 and 10 Å.
3. Second virial coefficients
The second virial coefficient was then calculated from these free energy profiles by evaluating the following integral,
where w(r) is the free energy profile as a function of the reaction coordinate. The results of this integration are shown in Fig. 4 alongside experimental data [44,45]. The various classical and quantum methodologies are all in good agreement with the experimental data and the work of Babin et_al [30] at high enough temperatures.
4. Free energy differences
In order to compare the free energy profiles to experimental data at lower temperature, we have calculated the free energy difference between monomers and dimers. In the zero temperature limit, the free energy difference is the same as the dissociation energy for the water dimer. We have utilized the relationship between the second virial coefficient and the ratio of dimer and monomer partition functions [46],
After rearranging this equation and inserting it into the definition of the change in free energy, we have the following expression:
The volume used in these calculations corresponds to the experimental pressure utilized in the determination of the bond dissociation energy of the water dimer [47]. The ΔA results for MB-pol have been plotted against T^{−1} in Fig. 5 for the classical and quantum umbrella sampling methodologies as well as the rigid Monte Carlo. The zero temperature classical limit has been denoted as Vclmin and is simply the minimum of the MB-pol potential. Additionally, we reported the difference in internal energy, ΔU, as the difference in internal energy of the dimer minus twice the internal energy of the monomer. The internal energy difference requires separate monomer and dimer simulations. We also report ΔA for the simple harmonic oscillator-rigid rotor approximation (HO-RR). The zero temperature limit for the HO-RR approximation is denoted as D0HO in Fig. 5 with a black marker. The experimental determination of the bond dissociation energy of the water dimer has been determined by Rocher-Casterline et_al [47] from velocity map imaging and has been included in the figure (13.2 ± 0.12 kJ/mol). Finally, the dissociation energy has also previously been computed using Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) for the ground state of the water dimer using the MB-pol model and is within the experimental error [48]. The results presented only go down to 25 K because the Mayer function in Eq. (15) no longer goes to 0 for larger distances and the second virial coefficient goes to negative infinity. This is because bound states dominate the partition function and their square integrable nature leads to a divergence in the Mayer function. For these lower temperatures, the choice of distance as a reaction coordinate becomes a poor choice, and it becomes necessary to evaluate the differences between the monomers and dimers in terms of energy. In order to obtain a zero temperature extrapolation, the difference between the HO-RR approximation at 25 K and the ground state limit was applied to the 25 K result of the quantum umbrella sampling data. This is a simple approximation to ΔA in the ground state that nearly gets within the experimental error bars (−12.90 ± 0.05 kJ/mol).
IV. CONCLUSION
We have studied the nature of the binding free energy of dimer systems over a broad range of temperatures and have demonstrated the domain of applicability of various approximations through comparison with converged path integral simulations. To do so, we have adapted the umbrella sampling method and have shown that a biasing potential applied to only a single path integral bead is required to correctly calculate the diagonal of the reduced density operator associated with the reaction coordinate. This post quantization restraint, or PQR, treatment was shown to be practical and was initially demonstrated using the simple Lennard-Jones dimer system for which exact results can also be obtained using matrix multiplication. Upon validation, we made the useful assumption that we may optimally choose the γ^{0} parameter of the PILE thermostat to be a function of the frequency of the umbrella sampling biasing potential.
This umbrella sampling procedure was then applied to the water dimer for multiple water models including the highly accurate MB-pol potential in order to obtain free energy profiles. In the high temperature (low β) limit, we have shown that a classical description of the system can be used to compute the free energy profile and second virial coefficients with accuracy. As the temperature is lowered, the classical description becomes increasingly poorer while the use of classical simulations with rigid monomers provides slightly more accurate virial coefficients. A mixed quantum classical description where the monomer degrees of freedom are treated quantum mechanically while the reaction coordinate is treated classically yields accurate virial coefficient at intermediate temperatures but was shown to fail in the description of the diagonal density matrix in the low temperature regime.
In the low temperature limit, we used the computed second virial coefficients to calculate ΔA and have demonstrated that a full quantum mechanical description is essential while classical and mixed quantum-classical treatments fail. This fact is exemplified when one extrapolates to the ground state limit where only a full quantum mechanical treatment yields the correct ground state dissociation energy. Note however that as we approached the ground state limit, the second virial coefficient calculation begins to break down and it becomes impractical to use the inter-monomer distance as a reaction coordinate. Nevertheless, we obtained an extrapolated theoretical estimate of ΔA of −12.90 ± 0.05 kJ/mol compared with the experimental dissociation energy of 13.2 ± 0.12 kJ/mol [47].
From a practical standpoint, classical mechanics holds at high temperature for the water dimer. For intermediate temperatures, the internal degrees of the water monomer exhibit stronger quantum effects, but the interaction between monomers is relatively classical and simpler calculations may be sufficient for B_{2} calculations. As the temperature is lowered, the interaction between monomers becomes more quantum, and the work presented here provides a method to obtain free energy profiles and differences in this regime. However, as the temperature is lowered further, all the way to the ground state, more relevant theoretical methods such as DMC and Path Integral Ground State (PIGS) [49] should be used. The PIGS method has been used with success to study the properties of weakly bound systems such as parahydrogen clusters using Monte Carlo sampling [50–52]. Recent work has shown that a Langevin thermostat, such as the one used in the present work, can also be adapted to open polymer path integral simulations [53]. These types of simulations have been used to obtain accurate energetic and structural properties of parahydrogen clusters [54] as well as Raman vibrational shifts in agreement with experimental measurements [55,56]. We therefore plan to use this Langevin equation Path Integral Ground State (LePIGS) approach to extend the present work to the ground state limit.
We finally note that in this work, the water molecules were treated as spinless by not distinguishing between the nuclear spin singlet p-H_{2}O and the triplet o-H_{2}O. There has been work done to incorporate the nuclear spin components of the water molecule into path integral simulations [57–60] of a water molecule embedded in a superfluid parahydrogen cluster using a so-called adiabatic hindered rotor [61,62] effective Hamiltonian. Future work will look into extending these techniques into the present methodology. Another extension of the present work is the computation of quantum mechanical free energies for larger water clusters. Recent path integral simulations of the water trimer using the MB-pol potential have revealed interesting dynamical features [63]. To tackle larger clusters, other enhanced sampling methods will be considered such as the recently proposed extended adaptive biasing force algorithm [64]. Computational speedups will also be possible with our recently proposed Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) acceleration of MMTK [65] based on the OpenMM [66] library.
