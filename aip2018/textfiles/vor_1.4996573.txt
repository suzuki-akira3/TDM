Generalized time-dependent Schrödinger equation in two dimensions under constraints
We investigate a generalized two-dimensional time-dependent Schrödinger equation on a comb with a memory kernel. A Dirac delta term is introduced in the Schrödinger equation so that the quantum motion along the x-direction is constrained at y = 0. The wave function is analyzed by using Green’s function approach for several forms of the memory kernel, which are of particular interest. Closed form solutions for the cases of Dirac delta and power-law memory kernels in terms of Fox H-function, as well as for a distributed order memory kernel, are obtained. Further, a nonlocal term is also introduced and investigated analytically. It is shown that the solution for such a case can be represented in terms of infinite series in Fox H-functions. Green’s functions for each of the considered cases are analyzed and plotted for the most representative ones. Anomalous diffusion signatures are evident from the presence of the power-law tails. The normalized Green’s functions obtained in this work are of broader interest, as they are an important ingredient for further calculations and analyses of some interesting effects in the transport properties in low-dimensional heterogeneous media.
I. INTRODUCTION
The problem of anomalous diffusion on percolation lattices drags much of researchers’ attention recently, due to the wide applicability in various natural as well as social phenomena. In the world of biomedical applications, epidemic spreading is very often modeled as diffusion among percolation clusters on planar lattices. Tumor cells spreading in heterogeneous tissues in a living body is also an area where modeling by means of anomalous diffusion plays an important role, Ref [1] and references therein. In solid state physics, electronic conduction in composite materials that involve inhomogeneities and different kinds of impurities is also an example of diffusion on a percolation lattice. While in the problems that involve cells, a classical approach towards diffusion problem is sufficient, in the area of electronic conduction modeling many difficulties arise because of the quantum properties. Therefore, the problems are either treated by a semi-classical approach, discussing the limits of applicability, or numerically, Refs [2] and  [3] and references therein.
In this paper, we are focused on generalizations of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation and the possibilities to derive closed-form solutions for a more general analytical treatment of diffusion problems that involve quantum-mechanical objects. So far, the Schrödinger equation, in the context of diffusion problems, was employed in various generalized forms [4–10]. A non-linear Schrödinger equation with random potential was shown to lead to the destruction of Anderson localization in quantum Schrödinger lattices [8]. Time-fractional operators in the Schrödinger equation were introduced in Ref [9]. Further, in Ref [10], it was shown that time-dependent solutions of a fractional Schrödinger equation with delta potentials manifest anomalous dynamics, governed by a power law, determined by the order of the fractional spatial operator. The physical relevance of the time-fractional Schrödinger equation and the deficiency in the quantum mechanical description, which could appear if the time-fractional Schrödinger equation is operated by a simple analogy with its classical counterpart, was discussed in detail in Ref [11], introducing a quantum comb model.
Comb-like models, which are also of present interest, appeared to offer a simple but general framework for describing anomalous diffusion in low-dimensional percolation clusters [12–15]. The classical equation which describes the diffusion on a comb-like structure is given by [16,17]
where P(x, y, t) is the probability distribution function (PDF), D_{x}δ(y) is the diffusion coefficient in the x direction, and D_{y} is the diffusion coefficients in the y direction. The delta function in the diffusion coefficient in the x direction means that the diffusion along the x direction occurs only at y = 0. Thus, this equation can be used to describe the diffusion in the backbone (at y = 0) where the teeth play role of traps. Different generalizations of comb structures have been introduced [18–21].
In the same manner as in (1), one may consider the Schrödinger equation on a comb as [11,22]
where l has a dimension [l] = m and is used for dimensional purposes since the dimension of δ(y) is m^{−1}. The presence of Dirac’s delta function in Eq. (2) ensures that the quantum motion of the particle along the x-direction is allowed only at y = 0. In Refs [11] and  [22], it is shown that the time fractional Schrödinger equation with a Caputo fractional derivative can be obtained by the projection of the two-dimensional (x, y) comb dynamics, described by Eq. (2), in the one-dimensional configuration space. The y coordinate in the comb model, thus, corresponds to the one-dimensional free motion. The fractional calculus can be introduced in quantum physics by means of the Feynman propagator for non-relativistic quantum mechanics, which leads to the appearance of the space fractional Schrödinger equation [6,23]. Furthermore, in Ref [24], a physical example where a fractional (in space and time) Schrödinger equation appears naturally as a formal effective description of diffusive wave transport in complex inhomogeneous media is given. Therefore, the fractional Schrödinger equation attracts much attention in different physical and mathematical investigations [10,25–31], including a description in terms of an effective complex potential [32–34].
In our previous paper [35], we have considered the time-dependent Schrödinger equation with memory kernel in one dimension, which in two dimensions can be rewritten as the following:
where γ(t) is the memory kernel which satisfies lim_{t→∞}γ(t)=lim_{s→0}sγ^(s)=0 and ℏ_{f} is the generalized Planck’s constant which takes into account the changes of its dimension depending on the choice of the memory kernel γ(t). For example, for γ(t) = δ(t), we have ℏ_{f} = ℏ. This memory kernel γ(t) could be an analog to the complex effective potential in the standard Schrödinger equation [33]. They both describe dissipation and could be used in the description of diffusive wave transport in inhomogeneous media [24] and simulation of resonant tunneling diode [36]. The corresponding generalized diffusion equation with memory kernel has been derived from the continuous time random walk theory by introducing the generalized form of the waiting time probability distribution function [37]. Such generalized diffusion equations are subject to weak ergodicity breaking and aging [38]. Moreover, ergodicity breaking in quantum systems [39] and aging in dissipative many-body quantum systems [40] have been observed as well.
In this paper, we consider Eq. (3) on a comb. Thus, it becomes
The initial condition is given by
and the boundary conditions ψ(x, y, t) and ∂∂qψ(x,y,t), q = {x, y}, at infinity, x = ±∞, y = ±∞, are set to zero.
This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we give a general solution of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation on a comb-like structure. Green’s function approach is used. Different forms of the memory kernel are considered in Sec. III and Green’s functions are represented in terms of the Fox H-function. In Sec. IV, we include a nonlocal term in the equation, and we present the result for Green’s function in terms of infinite series in the Fox H-function. Section V is the summary.
II. SOLUTION OF THE EQUATION
In order to solve Eq. (4), we first perform a Laplace transform (L[f(t)]=f^(s)) and then a Fourier transform with respect to x (F_{x}[f(x)]=f̃(κ_{x})) and y (F_{y}[f(y)]=f¯(κ_{y})) variables. Equation (4) for Green’s function G(x,y,t) in the Fourier-Fourier-Laplace space then becomes
From here, for the wave function, it follows
By the inverse Fourier transform with respect to κ_{y}, we obtain
from which it follows
By substitution of (9) in (7), we find
On the other side, by integrating Eq. (4) with respect to y, for Green’s function G_{1}(x,t)=∫−∞∞dyG(x,y,t) in the Fourier-Laplace space, we find
From here, we conclude that Green’s function G_{1}(x,t) is normalized to one, i.e., ∫−∞∞dxG_{1}(x,t)=1. Let us rewrite Eq. (11) as the following:
By the inverse Fourier-Laplace transform, we find the Schrödinger-like equation
where η(t)=L^{−1}γ^(s)s. The case with γ(t) = δ(t) gives the fractional Schrödinger-like equation of order 1/2,
where ∂^{α}∂t^{α}f(t)=1Γ(1−α)∫0tdt^{′}(t−t′){−α}ddt^{′}f(t^{′}) is the Caputo fractional derivative [41]. By dimensional analysis of Eq. (14), one may find that the dimensions of the generalized Planck’s constant and the Planck’s constant are the same ℏ_{f}=ℏ=kg m^{2}s^{−1} as it should be for γ(t) = δ(t).
In a same way, by the integration of Eq. (4) with respect to x, for Green’s function G_{2}(y,t)=∫−∞∞dxG(x,y,t) in the Fourier-Laplace space, we obtain
Green’s function G_{2}(y,t) is normalized to one as well, i.e., ∫−∞∞dyG_{2}(y,t)=1. We rewrite Eq. (15) as follows:
from which, by the inverse Fourier-Laplace transform, we find
which is studied in Ref [35] in detail. The case with γ(t) = δ(t) gives the standard Schrödinger equation
where ℏ_{f}=ℏ=kg m^{2}s^{−1} as we showed before.
Note that for the case γ^(s)=1 (corresponding to the Dirac delta memory kernel), solution (15) gives the free-particle Green’s function, which is also in accordance with Eq. (7) in Ref [10] for μ = 2.
III. PARTICULAR EXAMPLES
In this Section, we consider different forms of the memory kernel and we analyze Green’s functions.
A. Schrödinger equation on a comb
As it was mentioned above, for the Dirac delta memory kernel γ(t) = δ(t) (γ^(s)=1 and ℏ_{f} = ℏ), one obtains the standard Schrödinger equation on a comb (2); thus, Green’s functions become
and
where E_{α}(z) is the one parameter Mittag-Leffler (M-L) function [see relation (A1)] and Hp,qm,nz(a_{p},A_{p})(b_{q},B_{q}) is the Fox H-function (A3). In derivation of relation (19), we first apply the Laplace transform formula (A2) and then relations (A4) and (A5).
B. Fractional Schrödinger equation on a comb
Next we analyze the case of the power-law memory kernel γ(t)=t^{−α}Γ(1−α) (γ^(s)=s^{α−1}), which means a time fractional Schrödinger equation with a Caputo fractional derivative on a comb. For Green’s functions, we obtain
and
By dimensional analysis, one may show that the generalized Planck’s constant has the dimension ℏ_{f}=kg m^{2}s^{−α}.
The graphical representation of Green’s functions is given in Fig. 1. From the figure, one can easily see that the propagations of the wave packets in both directions are of the Fox H-function form.
C. Distributed order Schrödinger equation on a comb
One can also analyze the asymptotic behavior of Green’s functions in the case of distributed order memory kernel of the form
where τ is a characteristic time, p(λ) is a weight function, which means that we consider the distributed order Schrödinger equation on a comb-like structure, and ℏ_{f} = ℏ. Such distributed order memory kernel has been used in different contexts in Refs [41] and  [44]. The distributed order Schrödinger equation with memory kernel of form (23) has been recently analyzed in Ref [35]. The asymptotic behavior of Green’s functions in the long time limit can be obtained by using the Tauberian theorem [42]. By the inverse Fourier transform of (11) and (15), it follows,
and
For a weight function p(λ) = νλ^{ν−1}, i.e., γ^(s)=νγν,−logsτsτ−logsτ{ν}≃νΓ(ν)sτ−logsτ{ν}, where γ(α,x)=∫0xdtt^{ν−1}e^{−t} is the incomplete gamma function [43], which γν,x≃Γ(ν) for large x (small s, and thus large −log sτ), the asymptotic behaviors of Green’s functions in the long time limit become
and
The results for the uniformly distributed memory kernel p(λ) = 1 follow directly from (26) and (27) by substituting ν = 1.
IV. PRESENCE OF A NONLOCAL TERM
Next we include a nonlocal term with respect to spatial variable x in Eq. (4). Thus, we consider the following time-dependent Schrödinger equation with a nonlocal term on a comb:
The nonlocal term (interaction term) represents the interactions between the components of the system. Such nonlocal term in different contexts is considered in Refs [35] and  [45–47].
Let us give the nonlocal term by U(x)=𝜗2cosπλ/2Γ(−λ)|x|^{−λ−1}, i.e., Ũ(κ_{x}) = ϑ|κ_{x}|^{λ}. Following the same procedure as in Sec. II, for Green’s function, we find
Green’s function along the x-direction is given by
from which we can find the behavior of G_{1}(x,t) for particular forms of the memory kernel. Thus, for the standard Schrödinger equation [the Dirac delta memory kernel γ(t) = δ(t) with nonlocal term], Green’s function is given by
where Eα,βδ(z) is the three parameter M-L function (A1). Note that in the absence of the nonlocal term (ϑ = 0), result (31) reduces to (19) as it should be. The infinite series in the three parameter M-L functions that appear in (31) are convergent [48] (see also Refs [49] and  [50]). In a same way, one may calculate Green’s function in the case of the power-law memory kernel.
The graphical representation of Green’s function along the backbone is given in Fig. 2. The plot clearly demonstrates the non-local character of the considered equation, having Green’s function of the form of infinite series in Fox H-functions.
In a same way, one can analyze the standard Schrödinger equation [γ(t) = δ(t)] with constant potential U = Const (U(x) = U δ(x)) on a comb, i.e.,
Therefore, for G_{1}(x,t), we find
From here, in the absence of potential U = 0, solution (32) becomes (19).
V. SUMMARY
In this paper, a generalization of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation on a comb with memory kernel is considered. The quantum comb-like structure is captured by introducing a Dirac delta term in the Laplacian, contained in the kinetic energy operator in the Schrödinger equation, so that the quantized motion of the particle along the x direction is possible only at a position of y = 0. We perform the exact analytical solution of the equation by setting the initial conditions of the Dirac delta type, which by employing of the Laplace-Fourier transform method leads to the corresponding equations for Green’s functions. Further, we analyze Green’s functions in both directions x and y for different forms of the memory kernels. First, the standard Schrödinger equation on a comb, which is obtained for a delta-like memory kernel, is considered and Green’s functions in both directions are obtained. It is shown that along the backbones, the propagation of the wave packet in this case can be represented in terms of the Fox-H function. Along the fingers, the solution takes the free-particle Green’s function form, which is in agreement with the results obtained elsewhere. In the case of time-fractional Schrödinger equation with a Caputo fractional derivative, comprising the power-law memory kernel, which we analyze next, it is shown that Green’s functions are of the form of Fox-H functions in both directions, i.e., along the backbones and the fingers. The plots of the real part and imaginary part, as well as the modulus of Green’s functions are presented. The case of distributed order memory kernel is also considered. At the end, we present a solution of the Schrödinger equation with a nonlocal term on a comb, where the results can be represented in terms of infinite series in Fox H-functions. A clear peak in the modulus of Green’s function is observed in this case.
This paper offers a general framework for the mathematical modeling of a wave packet propagation on comb-like structures. Such structures could be considered as simplified representations of percolation lattices, which can be found in the problems of transport of quantum particles in various heterostructures and composite materials. Even though simplified, it has an advantage of leading to closed-form solutions, which gives a deeper insight and a possibility for a general analysis of the related phenomena. Wider generalizations of the cases in the presence of memory kernels and non-local terms are worked out in detail. The results obtained in this work could be used as an input for further analysis of the cases of various attractive or repulsive non-local potentials. The normalized Green’s functions are also an important ingredient for further calculations of current density and, therefore, for the prediction of interesting effects of the comb lattices on the transport properties in low-dimensional heterogeneous media.
APPENDIX: THE MITTAG-LEFFLER AND FOX H-FUNCTIONS
The three parameter M-L function is defined by [51]
where (δ)_{k} = Γ(δ + k)/Γ(δ) is the Pochhammer symbol. Its Laplace transform is given by [51]
The case δ = 1 yields the two parameter M-L function E_{α,β}(z), and the case β = δ = 1 yields the one parameter M-L function E_{α}(z).
The Fox H-function (or simply H-function) is defined by the following Mellin-Barnes integral [52]:
where θ(s)=∏j=1mΓ(b_{j}−B_{j}s)∏j=1nΓ(1−a_{j}+A_{j}s)∏j=m+1qΓ(1−b_{j}+B_{j}s)∏j=n+1pΓ(a_{j}−A_{j}s), 0 ≤ n ≤ p, 1 ≤ m ≤ q, a_{i}, b_{j} ∈ C, A_{i}, B_{j} ∈ R^{+}, i = 1, …, p, j = 1, …, q. The contour Ω starting at c − ı∞ and ending at c + ı∞ separates the poles of the function Γ(b_{j} + B_{j}s), j = 1, …, m from those of the function Γ(1 − a_{i} − A_{i}s), i = 1, …, n.
