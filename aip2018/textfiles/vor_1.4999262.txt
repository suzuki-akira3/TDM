Time independent fractional Schrödinger equation for generalized Mie-type potential in higher dimension framed with Jumarie type fractional derivative
In this paper, we obtain approximate bound state solutions of an N-dimensional fractional time independent Schrödinger equation for a generalised Mie-type potential, namely, V(r^{α})=Ar^{2α}+Br^{α}+C. Here α(0 < α < 1) acts like a fractional parameter for the space variable r. When α = 1 the potential converts into the original form of Mie-type of potential that is generally studied in molecular and chemical physics. The entire study is composed with a Jumarie-type fractional derivative approach. The solution is expressed via the Mittag-Leffler function and fractionally defined confluent hypergeometric function. To ensure the validity of the present work, obtained results are verified with the previous studies for different potential parameter configurations, specially for α = 1. At the end, few numerical calculations for energy eigenvalue and bound state eigenfunctions are furnished for a typical diatomic molecule.
I. INTRODUCTION
Although the classical calculus provides quite a promising tool to model and explain different dynamical phenomena, still there are uncountable complex systems in nature which demand the generalization of classical calculus. For example, the non-linear oscillation of earthquake [1], the fluid dynamics traffic model [2], the transport of chemical contaminant through porous rock [3], the dynamics of visco-elastic materials [4], and more in biology, continuum and statistical mechanics, anomalous transport, and magneto-thermoelastic diffusion [5–8] are only possible to model elegantly, at least from the mathematical point of view, if concern differential equations are developed with arbitrary order derivatives (commonly known as fractional order derivatives).
Addition to the above list, quantum mechanics is also one of the most celebrated areas of study where fractional derivatives are employed for remodeling the Schrödinger equation [9]. Basically being a non-relativistic equation, the Schrödinger equation is an essential tool for the study of atoms, nuclei, and molecules and their spectral behaviours through a proper potential function which describes the nature of bonding of the quantum particles. One may ask “why we will remodel Schrödinger equation via fractional derivatives?” “Does this change will describe any new phenomena?” Obviously there is a physical reason behind this. There are lots of similarities between the standard diffusion equation and basic Schrödinger equation. Now when non-Brownian paths are taken in the path integral approach, the resulting diffusion equation emerges with fractional derivatives which properly describe many complex diffusion phenomena [10]. As the Schrödinger equation is an outcome of the Feynman path integral formalism, one may expect the same type of outcome for the Schrödinger equation over the non-Brownian path. Based on this theoretical view, the fractional Schrödinger equation has been developed by Laskin [11]. After Guo and Xu [12], Dong and Xu [13] studied the space fractional Schrödinger equation with few specific potential models. More recent studies on the one-dimensional fractional Schrödinger equation can be found in Refs [14–17].
Motivated by these studies and others in this paper, we find the approximate bound state solution of the time independent fractional Schrödinger equation for generalized Mie-type potentials in N-dimensions. The idea of higher dimension is not fancy in physics. String theory, the only self-consistent quantum theory of gravity, needs more extra spatial dimensions over the usual three dimensions to support the theoretical structure. We do not feel the addition dimensions neither they have been discovered from any high energy particle physics experiments but we cannot say that they do not exit. Perhaps we could be restrained to the 3D world, which is in fact part of a more complicated multidimensional universe possibly up to 10 or more spacial dimensions [18,19]. The advantage of higher dimensional study is that it provides a general treatment of the model in such a manner that one can obtain required results in lower dimensions just dialling appropriate N. The Mie-type potentials [20] are originally defined as
where D_{0} is the interaction energy between two atoms in a molecular system at equilibrium distance r = r_{0}. Here a_{0} and b_{0} are restricted to take integer values. In this paper, we will overrule the restriction for a_{0} and b_{0} and proposed a more general form of the potential by adding a constant term C. If b_{0} = 2α, a_{0} = α (0 < α < 1), then the potential gets a nicer form as
where A=D_{0}r02α and B=−2D_{0}r0α. This form is customary and flexible in terms of mathematical point of view. When α = 1 with A=−D_{0}r02,B=2D_{0}r_{0}, and C = −D_{0}, we have the modified Kratzer potential and similarly for A=D_{0}r02,B=−2D_{0}r_{0}, and C = 0, we have the Kratzer-Fues potential [21].
To make this present work self-contained, it is organized as follows: In Sec. II, we briefly outline the Jumarie-type fractional derivative and Laplace transform of fractional differ-integrals. In Sec. III, we construct the N-dimensional Schrödinger equation via the fractional Laplacian operator in hyperspherical coordinate. Bound state spectrum for the Mie-type potential is obtained in Sec. IV. Section V is devoted for the discussion where theoretical as well as numerical results are discussed with few eigenfunctions plotting. Finally the conclusion of the work appears in Sec. VI.
II. OUTLINE OF FRACTIONAL DERIVATIVE AND LAPLACE TRANSFORM
A. Fractional order derivative of Jumarie type
Jumarie [22] defined the fractional order derivative by modifying the left-Riemann-Liouville (RL) fractional derivative in the following form for a continuous function f(x) (but not necessarily differentiable) in the interval a to x, with f(x) = 0 for x < a:
It is customary to take the start point of the interval as a = 0 and use the symbol _{0}^{J}D_{x}^{α}[f(x)] for f^{(α)}(x). Here from in the rest of the paper we will always denote the fractional derivative f^{(α)}(x)≡d^{α}f(x)dx^{α} as _{0}^{J}D_{x}^{α}[f(x)] with Jumarie sense. In the above definition, the first expression is just the Riemann-Liouville fractional integration, and the second expression is known as modified Riemann-Liouville derivative of order 0 < α < 1 because of the involvement of f(a). The third line definition is for the range n ≤ α < n + 1. Apart from the integral type of definition we can also express the fractional derivative via fractional difference. Let f:R→R denote a continuous (but not necessarily differentiable) function such that x → f(x) for all x∈R. If h > 0 denotes a constant discretization span with forward operator FW(h)f(x) = f(x + h), then the right-hand fractional difference of f(x) of order α (0 < α < 1) is defined by the expression [23]
where generalized binomial coefficients Γ(α−i)Γ(−α)Γ(i+1)=i−α−1i=(−1){i}αi. These equalities are being readily established from the definition of a binomial coefficient and generalization of factorials with the gamma function {n}C_{r}=nr=n!r!(n−r)!. Then the Jumarie fractional derivative is defined as
This definition is close to the standard definition of derivatives for beginner’s study. Following this definition it is clear that the αth derivative of a constant for 0 < α < 1 is zero. Few results for the Jumarie-type derivative are listed below depending on the characteristics of given function (f[u(x)]) [24]:
In fractional calculus, the solution of any linear fractional differential equation, composed with the Jumarie derivative, can be easily obtained in terms of the Mittag-Leffler function of one parameter [25] which is defined as
or in a more general form [26]E_{α,β}(z)=∑κ=0∞z^{κ}Γ(ακ+β). Clearly E_{α,1}(z) = E_{α}(z) and E_{1,1}(z) = E_{1}(z) = e^{z}. We provide few derivative rules [27,28] associated with the Mittag-Leffler function and its trigonometric counterparts,
where one-parameter fractional sine and cosine functions are defined as follows [29]:
cos_{α}(x^{α})=∑κ=0∞(−1){κ}x^{2κα}Γ(1+2ακ) and sin_{α}(x^{α})=∑κ=0∞(−1){κ}x^{(2κ+1)α}Γ(1+(2κ+1)α) with
E_{α}(ix^{α}) = cos_{α}(x^{α}) + isin_{α}(x^{α}).
B. Laplace transformation of fractional differ-integrals
In a general Laplace transform, F(s) or L of a function f(x) is defined as [30]
If there is some constant σ∈R such that |e^{−σx}f(x)|≤M for sufficiently large x, the above definition will exist for Re [s] > σ. The following are the well-known derivative properties of Laplace transform when n is an integer,
where the superscript (n) denotes the nth derivative with respect to x for f^{(n)}(x) and with respect to s for F^{(n)}(s). Now if n becomes non integer, say α, then the above two rules are generalized as [31]
where n is the largest integer such that (n − 1) < α ≤ n and τ=−cosec((α−δ)π)cosec(−δπ) with −1 < δ < 0 (see Appendix B). The sum in Eq. (2.9a) is zero when α ≤ 0. Equation (2.9b) shows that Lx^{α}f(x)≠±d^{α}F(s)ds^{α} but when α = 1 (that makes τ = 1), this is consistent with Eq. (2.8b) if we take n = 1. Choosing the initial condition f(0) = 0 (frequently appears in quantum mechanical problems) it is easy to have Ld^{α}f(x)dx^{α}=s^{α}F(s). Under this circumstance one can generate Lx^{α}d^{β}f(x)dx^{β} as follows:
where we have used the rule (uv)^{α} = u^{(α)}v + v^{(α)}u in Jumarie sense. It is important to mention here that the condition f(0) = 0 not only goes with Jumarie sense but also with the other fractional derivative formulation, like Caputo. The fractional derivative of the Jumarie type does not demand the function need to be differentiable, whereas the Caputo definition demands the condition of differentiability. These two fractional derivatives are the same if and only if the function being considered is differentiable. The operational formula expressed by Eq. (2.10) will be used in the proceeding calculation. There are few more operational formulas which are well established in the literature [25,31],
III. CONSTRUCTION OF FRACTIONAL SCHRÖDINGER EQUATION IN N-DIMENSIONS
In this subsection, we will define the Cartesian coordinates x_{i} in N-dimensional space as
where b ∈ [3, N − 1] and ϕ^{α}=θN−1α. Here r^{α} and θbα are the hyperspherical coordinates in N-dimensions. Clearly when N = 3 and α = 1 the above equations convert into usual three-dimensional coordinate system (r, θ, φ). Denoting θ_{1} = φ, θ_{2} (=ϕ) = θ we can have x_{1} ≡ x = r sin θ cos φ, x_{2} ≡ y = r sin θ sin φ, and x_{3} ≡ z = r cos θ. Proceeding further to the present hyperspherical coordinates the sum of the squares of Eqs. (3.1) provides
where we have used E_{α}(±ix^{α}) = cos_{α}(x^{α}) ± isin_{α}(x^{α}) and E_{α}(i(x + y)^{α}) = E_{α}(ix^{α}) × E_{α}(iy^{α}) in Jumarie [29] sense. Thus r^{α} is the fractional hyper-radius of an N-dimensional sphere. Now following the usual expression of Laplacian operator in a curvilinear coordinate [32], the fractional Laplacian operator in terms of hyperspherical coordinates can be written as
where the symbol _{0}^{J}D_{θk}^{α}=∂^{α}∂θkαor d^{α}dθkα denotes the Jumarie fractional derivative operator and
To make the hyperspherical Laplacian operator fractional, we have used the same α (as of hyper-radius) for constructing the exponent term. It is only for computational convenience. Now using Eqs. (2.4d), (2.6c), and (2.6d) it is not hard to find
So we have
This helps us to write Eq. (3.3) as
where ΛN−12α is fractional hyperangular momentum operator. The explicit form is
Fractional hyperangular momentum is a conserved physical quantity associated with this operator and in natural unit it is unit less. Usually hyperangular momentum is characterised by a quantum number and the dimensionality of space (see more in Appendix A). Before going further here we can verify the form of the usual three-dimensional Laplacian operator when α = 1. Earlier we have denoted θ_{1} = φ, θ_{2} (=ϕ) = θ. Then Eq. (3.7) gives ∇32≡∇^{2}=1r^{2}∂∂rr^{2}∂∂r−Λ22r^{2}, where Λ22 can be obtained form Eq. (3.8) as Λ22=−1sin⁡θ∂∂θ(sin⁡θ∂∂θ)+1sin^{2}⁡θ∂^{2}∂φ^{2}. So this concludes the verification that
Now we are in a position to write the N-dimensional fractional time independent Schrödinger equation for a diatomic molecule of reduced mass (centre of mass coordinate system) M=m_{1}m_{2}m_{1}+m_{2}, where m_{1} and m_{2} are the masses of constituent particles forming the molecule. If we choose the natural unit ℏ = c = 1, then the form of the equation in large-N expansion [33] will be
where E_{α} and V(r^{α}) are the fractional energy and potential energy, respectively. They both have unit GeV^{α}. We will consider the mass M as a fractional mass also with energy unit GeV^{α}. When α = 1, all these units are well familiar within the natural unit scheme. The term ΩNα within the argument of ψ denotes angular variables θ1α,θ2α,θ3α,…,θN−2α,ϕ^{α}. Taking the solution by means of a separation variable technique ψ(r^{α},ΩNα)=R(r^{α})Y(ΩNα) and adopting the eigenvalue equation for Y(ΩNα) as (see Appendix A for more)
where ℓ is orbital angular momentum quantum number, we have the fractional order hyperradial or in short “radial” equation
Here in deriving Eq. (3.11) from Eq. (3.9), we have expanded Eq. (3.7) by means of Jumarie derivative rules. It is worth to mention that ℓ can take quantized values 0, 1, 2, 3, … only.
IV. BOUND STATE SPECTRUM OF FRACTIONAL MIE-TYPE POTENTIAL
Inserting the potential (1.1) into Eq. (3.11) and using the following abbreviations,
we have
We choose the bound state eigenfunctions ψ(r^{α},ΩNα) that are vanishing for r → 0 and r → ∞. Since this type of initial conditions is associated with R(r^{α}), we take the predetermined solution of Eq. (4.2) as
Here the term (rα){−k} ensures the fact that R(r → ∞) = 0. The unknown function f(r^{α}) is expected to behave like f(r → 0) = 0. After deriving _{0}^{J}D_{r}^{2α}[f(r^{α})], _{0}^{J}D_{r}^{α}[f(r^{α})] and performing little calculation on Eq. (4.2) we have
where
Finding the solution of Eq. (4.4) is a difficult task due to the strong singular term Q_{2}(α,k,N,ν_{α})r^{2α}. To ease out the situation we will study Eq. (4.4) in transformed space (Laplace) with a parametric restriction
It is important to mention here that the above condition is not mandatory or essential to apply the Laplace transform on Eq. (4.4). The imposed condition only helps us to reduce the tenacious mathematical steps. Denoting the solution of Eq. (4.6) for k (>0) as kα*, we can rewrite Eq. (4.4) as
where f(r^{α}) is replaced with g(r). Now defining Lg(r)=ζ(s) and using the rules of Laplace transform, mentioned in Subsection II B with g(0) = 0, it is easy to obtain the following fractional differential equation (see Appendix B):
where
The exact solution of Eq. (4.8) is very complicated and tedious in fractional domain. The good news is we can approximate the solution very near to the α ≈ 1.00 (see Appendix B). Adopting Jumarie sense integration with the definition of “α-logarithmic” function [34], i.e., ∫d^{α}tt=Ln_{α}(tC),t=E_{α}(Ln_{α}t), where C denotes a constant such that (tC)>0, we have the approximate solution in transformed space as
where C_{1} is the integration constant. The second factor of Eq. (4.10) is a multivalued function when the power −λ_{2} is a non-integer. The quantum mechanical eigenfunction must be single valued in nature. So we must take
The inverse transform of Eq. (4.10) will provide the solution of the problem in actual space. To that aim, we expand Eq. (4.10) with help of Eq. (4.11) as
Using the formula given by Eq. (2.11d) for α = β we can find the inverse of Eq. (4.12) quite easily,
where Eα(m_{j})(−ϵ_{α}r^{α})=d^{mj}dr^{mj}E_{α}(−ϵ_{α}r^{α})=∑p=0∞(p+m_{j})!p!(−ϵαrα){p}Γ(αp+αm_{j}+α) [25] and _{1}F_{1} is fractionally defined confluent hypergeometric function, i.e.,
Hence the complete radial eigenfunctions are
where N_{c}=C_{1}Γ(γ_{α}) acts like a normalization constant. The energy eigenvalue equation of the potential model comes out from Eq. (4.11) as
V. DISCUSSION
Originally, Schrödinger equation is a second order differential equation with non-constant coefficients under the potential model V(r). In this study, we have generalized the potential model as V(r^{α}) and eventually studied the fractional Schrödinger equation in multidimensional space. As an example, the generalized Mie-type potential has been taken as V(r^{α}) and solved approximately for α ≈ 1.00. The solution is very close to the exact one, which means we can express the grand solution as
where ∑_{n} helps us to express the overall solution in terms of all possible solutions, i.e., a linear combinational form via the constants C_{n}(n = 1, 2, 3, …). It has been noticed that for a particular value of α(0 < α < 1), the solution depends on the dimensionality as well as on the potential variables A, B, C. The potential parameter B is not a free parameter as A and C. For example, under any circumstances, the parameter B cannot be taken as zero, otherwise it will force β_{α} to have a zero value and spoil the quantization condition given by Eq. (4.11). Here we have few special cases.
A. Fractional Coulomb potential
For this case, A = C = 0 and B ≠ 0 make the potential as V(r^{α})=Br^{α}. Immediately we have the energy eigenvalue equation
with the radial eigenfunction
In this case, the values of kα* emerge from Eq. (4.6), where ν_{α}(ν_{α} + 1) = ℓ(ℓ + N − 2)(α!)^{2}. Now when α = 1 (as a result τ = 1), Eq. (4.6) provides k1*=ℓ+N−2 and hence Q_{1}(1,k1*,N)=−2ℓ−N+3. The energy eigenvalue becomes
The radial eigenfunctions come out as
where N^{′} is new normalization constant, viz., N^{′}=N_{c}(−ϵ){mj}. The results are similar with the previous studies [19,35].
B. Mie-type potential in N dimension when α = 1
Under this condition it is easy to rewrite Eq. (4.6) as k(k + 1) − k(N − 1) − ν(ν + 1) = 0. For simplicity we write the positive solution of k as k1*=k_{ℓN}. This enable us to find Q_{1}(1,k1*,N)=−2k_{ℓN}+N−1. Hence the energy eigenvalues for this situation emerge as
with the radial eigenfunctions
N^{′} acts as the normalization constant as previous. All outcomes in this subsection are well matched with the results [36].
Apart from the theoretical aspects, we have examined the present model numerically also. For a typical diatomic molecule (M = 0.31 GeV^{α}, D_{0} = 2 × 10^{−9} GeV^{α}, r_{0} = 10^{5} GeV^{−α}), energy eigenvalues have been derived in Table I. This clearly shows that bound state energy (E_{nαNℓ}<0) is possible for α(0 < α < 1) to some extent. In the case of dimension N = 3, physically significant energy eigenvalues come out in the range 0.85 < α < 1 for n = 1, 2 states with ℓ = 1. Corresponding eigenfunctions have been shown in Figs. 1 and 2. The eigenfunctions are continuous and well behaved, but for lower α, such as near α = 0.85, the graph looses its periodicity significantly and tries to blow up in the selected range. As the dimension N increases, the quantum mechanical well behaved eigenfunctions are only possible from α = 0.95 to α = 1. These are displayed in Figs. 3–6, respectively. In these cases, going to the further lower α near 0.90 the eigenfunction losses its well-behaved property for N = 4, 5. This is due to the value of the kα* originated from the condition Q_{2}(α, k, N, ν_{α}) = 0. It is important to mention here that the function Q_{2} is very crucial to stabilize the entire model of the present study. The solution of Q_{2}(α, k, N, ν_{α}) = 0, i.e., kα*, has several possibilities but only bound states are possible for those kα* for which the difference (γ_{α}−kα*) is not so large to make the factor r^{α(γα−kα*)−1}, in Eq. (4.14), a sharp increasing one.
C. Generalized fractional Kratzer-Fues potential
Different potential parameters for a typical diatomic molecule and τ against α.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have studied approximate bound state solutions of the N-dimensional fractional Schrödinger equation for generalised Mie-type potential, namely, V(r^{α})=Ar^{2α}+Br^{α}+C, where α(0 < α < 1) acts like a fractional parameter. We have framed the entire study by Jumarie-type derivative rules. Applying the separation variable method, the N-dimensional fractional Schrödinger equation has been separated into hyperradial (or radial) and hyperangular equations which contain the fractional order derivatives. The radial fractional order differential equation, coupled with the eigenvalues of the hyperangular part, is found complicated due to the strong singular term 1r^{2α}. To solve this, after introducing a parametric restriction to remove the strong singular term, we have constructed the replica of the radial equation in transformed space (Laplace space) which is comparatively easy to tackle, as it contains the lower order fractional derivative of transformed variable. Inverse transform of the transformed equation provides us the radial eigenfunction in actual space with one parameter Mittag-Leffler function and fractional confluent hypergeometric function. Energy eigenvalue has been obtained via a quantization condition which also prevents the eigenfunction to turn into a multivalued one. The results are verified for the (i) Coulomb potential in N and 3 dimensions and (ii) Mie-type potential in 3 dimensions. We have also furnished numerical results as well as few eigenfunctions for a typical diatomic molecular system and studied their variation with α. This present study encourages to use the fractional Schrödinger equation for different potential models and disclose the hidden physics behind it for 0 < α < 1. Before ending the conclusion we have drawn Fig. 7, the generalized fractional Kratzer-Fues potential for different α. An interesting physics is going with Fig. 7 and the associated eigenfunctions. As α is lowered, the strength of the potential becomes smaller, i.e., tending to zero. In other word, we can interpret that the under examined particle is somehow becoming a free particle type. Under such circumstance, the eigenfunctions specially for (N > 3) and lower α tend to approach the eigenfunction of an infinite spherical well type problem or the quantum mechanical box problem of a free particle. Though the periodicity losses, the spatial spreading of the eigenfunctions becomes narrower eventually which signifies that the probability of finding the particle in the specified range becomes higher. Now since the uncertainty in position of the particle decreases, according to uncertainty principle, the uncertainty in momentum will increase considerably. This will also make the energy more uncertain. This is what we have achieved in Table I. It is clear in the table that as we go to the higher dimensions with lower α, the energy eigenvalues become less prominent. More work in the aspect of uncertainty principle via the fractional Schrödinger equation needs to be carried out.
APPENDIX A: FEW DEFINITIONS AND TERMINOLOGIES
The relations between the Cartesian coordinates x_{i} and the hyperspherical coordinates r and θ_{b} in N dimensional space are defined as
where b ∈ [3, N − 1]. These generate r^{2}=∑i=1Nxi2. The volume element of the configuration space is calculated as ∏a=1Ndx_{a}=r^{N−1}drdΩ, where Ω=∏a=1N−1(sin⁡θa){a−1}dθ{a} with r ∈ (0, ∞), θ_{1} ∈ (−π.π) and θ_{c} ∈ (0, π), c ∈ (2, N − 1).
Ordinary spherical harmonic Y (θ, φ), in the case of Schrödinger hydrogen atom problem, is the eigenfunction of angular momentum operator Λ^{2}. The eigenvalue is characterized by the angular momentum quantum number ℓ and dimension N. We know that in two dimensions the eigenvalue of angular momentum operator is ℓ^{2} ≡ ℓ(ℓ + 2 − 2), for three dimensions it is ℓ(ℓ + 1) ≡ ℓ(ℓ + 3 − 2) ⋯. So in N dimensions the eigenvalue is taken as ℓ(ℓ + N − 2). As ℓ is a quantum number it is restricted to take integer values like 0, 1, 2, 3, …. In fractional Schrödinger equation, for radial symmetry fractional potential problem in N dimensions, the spherical harmonic Y(ΩNα) is named as hyperspherical harmonic via fractional generalised coordinates. In this study, we have proposed that the eigenvalue equation for the generalised angular momentum operator is of the form
where eigenvalue ℓ(ℓ + N − 2) is independent of fractional parameter α.
APPENDIX B: DETAIL MATHEMATICAL STEPS
Let us take ϕ(s)=Lf(x)=s^{δ} with −1 < δ < 0. Then
where we have used Γ(−y)Γ(y + 1) = −π cosec(πy) and Lx^{m}=(m+1)s^{m+1} in the above steps. So we can have
where τ=−cosec((α−δ)π)cosec(−δπ), and when α = 1 it makes τ = 1.
The above relation is valid for a function f(x) such that f(x)=x^{−δ−1}Γ(−δ);δ≠0 for which the Laplace transform is ϕ(s) = s^{δ}. The above example suggests that it is futile to seek generalization of classical formula as in classical calculus and Laplace transform, i.e., Lx^{n}f(x)=(−1){n}ϕ^{(n)}(s). However, for n as non-integer we use the expression Lx^{α}f(x)=−τd^{α}ds^{α}ϕ(s). A simple criterion for a function f(x) ∼ x^{p} is fractionally differintegrable when p > −1, which comes from a fact that D^{α}x^{p}=Γ(p+1)Γ(p+1−α)x^{p−α} to be finite one needs Γ(p+1)Γ(p+1−α) should exist; that is, when p + 1 > 0 and p + 1 − α > 0, i.e., we are excluding p + 1 = 0 and p + 1 − α = 0, where the gamma function is blowing out. With these two, we say p > −1 as a condition for a function f(x) ∼ x^{p} as fractionally differintegrable. For our case, Lf(x)=s^{δ} is fractionally differintegrable if δ > −1 and our f(x)=x^{−δ−1}Γ(−δ)=L^{−1}s^{δ}, where δ ≠ 0. Thus we take −1 < δ < 0 to have the values of τ.
Let us write Eq. (4.7) in a general way and find the solution with given initial condition. So the problem is to find the solution of
with the initial condition y(0) = 0.
Let the Laplace transform of y(x) be taken as z(t), i.e., z(t)=Ly(x). Following Sec. II, we have these equations,
Now taking the Laplace transform on Eq. (B2) and using above three results we have
Rearrangement of the transformed equation (B4) yields
where b=Γ(1+2α)Γ(1+α)−c_{1}τ, c=c_{2}τ, and η(t^{α})=bt^{α}−ct^{2α}−c32. Now writing η(t^{α})=λ_{1}t^{α}+c_{3}+λ_{2}t^{α}−c_{3} with λ_{1}=b2+c2c_{3} and λ_{2}=b2−c2c_{3}, Eq. (B5) can be expressed as
Proceeding to the integration of the last step we can write
Using the definition of fractional logarithmic function in Jumarie sense ∫d^{α}tt=Ln_{α}(tC),t=E_{α}(Ln_{α}t), where C denotes a constant such that (tC)>0 and Ln_{α}t denotes the inverse function of the Mittag-Leffler function. The integral form of Ln_{α}t is given by Ln_{α}t=1(1−α)!∫0t(dξξ){α}. So we have
Using Ln_{α}x^{y} = y^{α}Ln_{α}x we write
Similarly
Hence from Eq. (B6) we can get
where c_{4}=−(1−α)!α^{α}(λ_{1}+λ_{2})Ln_{α}(c_{3}). We have these identities in Jumarie sense Ln_{α}(x^{y}) = y^{α}Ln_{α}x and (Lnα(uv)){1α}=(Lnαu){1α}+(Lnαv){1α}.
Here we can make an approximation for α ≈ 1.00 as Ln_{α}(x^{y}) ≈ yLn_{α}x and (Ln_{α}(uv)) ≈ (Ln_{α}u) + (Ln_{α}v). Using these approximations we write Eq. (B9)
Hence from the above equation we write the approximate solution for α ≈ 1.00 as follows:
where C^{′}=Cc_{5} is any arbitrary suitable constant. In using the Laplace technique we assume z(t) ∼ t^{δ}, i.e., “the power law function” and eventually applied the Laplace transform relations to get Eq. (B4). The solution yields in terms of Mittag-Leffler function are also the sum of power law function. Thus our first approximation is valid to get the final solution in terms of fractional Logarithmic function. Finally after further simplification and using α ≈ 1.00 we do get a solution (B10) in terms of power law functions. Now for calculation of τ, for different values of α, we select arbitrarily a value of δ = −0.5, i.e., a mid value of −1 < δ < 0. Any other choice of δ would produce different values of τ but the analysis would remain the same.
