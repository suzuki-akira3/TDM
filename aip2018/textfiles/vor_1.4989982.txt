Sensitivity analysis of the noise-induced oscillatory multistability in Higgins model of glycolysis
A phenomenon of the noise-induced oscillatory multistability in glycolysis is studied. As a basic deterministic skeleton, we consider the two-dimensional Higgins model. The noise-induced generation of mixed-mode stochastic oscillations is studied in various parametric zones. Probabilistic mechanisms of the stochastic excitability of equilibria and noise-induced splitting of randomly forced cycles are analysed by the stochastic sensitivity function technique. A parametric zone of supersensitive Canard-type cycles is localized and studied in detail. It is shown that the generation of mixed-mode stochastic oscillations is accompanied by the noise-induced transitions from order to chaos.
I. INTRODUCTION
A complexity in the oscillatory behavior of the dynamic systems is usually associated with a combination of fast and slow phases, different amplitudes and frequencies, and regular and chaotic regimes. In reality, oscillations rarely are harmonic, but typically demonstrate various non-uniformities. Such mixed-mode oscillations (MMO) are ubiquitous in nature and have been observed in chemical reactions [1–4], neurodynamics [5–7], electronics [8,9], population dynamics [10], and so on. Mathematically, an appearance of MMOs can be explained by the strong nonlinearity, local and global bifurcations, fast-slow dynamics, and Canard-type phenomena [11–18].
A presence of noise substantially increases a variability of the MMOs [19] and generates unexpected phenomena that have no analogues in the deterministic case. Here, noise-induced transitions [20], stochastic excitability [21], noise-induced multistability, preference and annihilation of attractors [22–24], stochastic and coherence resonance [25–27], noise-induced synchronization [28,29] and chaos [30,31] are well known.
A problem of the explanation of intrinsic mechanisms of the complex oscillatory behavior of biochemical systems attracts attention of many researchers. Here, the first mathematical model was suggested by Higgins [32], who has linked an appearance of self-oscillations in the yeast glycolytic system with the existence of a limit cycle. Later, other specific and more complicated models of the glycolysis have been proposed [1,2,33–35]. Complex oscillatory regular and chaotic regimes in glycolysis were found in many-dimensional multistable dynamic models [36–41].
However, the complex behavior can be modeled by more simple conceptual, so-called minimal systems. The aim of this paper is to show that the Higgins model, even with the additive Gaussian noise, has the parametric zones where one can observe a variety of the complex dynamic phenomena, such as Canard-type cycles, stochastic excitability, coherence resonance, and noise-induced bistability with the generation of mixed-mode oscillations, splitting of stochastic cycles, and noise-induced transition to chaos.
In Sec. II, a short description of the dynamic regimes in the deterministic Higgins model is given. Here, a parametric zone of Canard-type explosion of limit cycles is found.
In Sec. III, we consider a variety of noise-induced phenomena in the stochastically forced Higgins model. At first, a phenomenon of the noise-induced excitability in the zone of stable equilibria is studied. Here, a transition from small-amplitude stochastic oscillations (SASO) to large-amplitude stochastic oscillations (LASO) with sharp spikes is analysed. Such noise-induced bistability with stochastic MMOs is studied with the help of the power spectral density and statistics of interspike intervals. A phenomenon of the coherence resonance is discussed. For the analytical study of the noise-induced bistability, the stochastic sensitivity function technique [42,45] and constructive method of confidence ellipses are applied. Elements of this technique are briefly presented in the Appendix.
Further, we study the effect of noise on limit cycles. Here, a parametric zone with a high stochastic sensitivity of cycles is localized, and a supersensitive Canard-type cycle is found. A phenomenon of the noise-induced splitting of stochastic cycles is demonstrated and investigated with the help of the power spectral density and confidence bands.
In Sec. IV, it is shown that the generation of MMOs is accompanied by the noise-induced transitions from order to chaos. Here, Lyapunov exponents are analysed in the zone of the Canard-type explosion.
II. DETERMINISTIC MODEL
Consider the deterministic Higgins model [32,43]
with positive parameters p and q. The system (1) is one of the first mathematical models of a product-activated and substrate-inhibited reaction of glycolysis. Here, x and y are dimensionless concentrations of the substrate and product, respectively.
In this model, oscillatory regimes appear as a result of the transition from the equilibrium to limit cycle through the Andronov – Hopf (AH) bifurcation. In two-parametric space, the line p=q+1 marks this AH bifurcation. For 0<p<q+1, the system (1) has a unique stable equilibrium x¯=y¯=1. For p>q+1, this equilibrium is unstable, and the system (1) exhibits a stable limit cycle.
In Fig. 1, bifurcation diagrams of the system (1) are presented for two values of the parameter q. Here, extreme values of y-coordinates of attractors are shown. As one can see, for q = 1 [see Fig. 1(a)], the amplitude of self-oscillations uniformly increases with increasing p. However, for smaller q, in this dependence, a new essential feature appears. As one can see in Fig. 1(b) for q = 0.2, there is a zone of Canard explosion, where the amplitude of the oscillations sharply increases.
In the zone of small q, the model has other important peculiarities associated with the irregular arrangement of the phase trajectories near the attractors. In Fig. 2 for q = 0.2, the cases of the stable equilibrium (p = 1.1) and the stable limit cycle (p = 1.28) are shown. Note that for q = 0.2, the point of AH bifurcation is p = 1.2. As can be seen in Fig. 2(a), for small initial deviations from the stable equilibrium, the phase trajectory tends to the equilibrium with damped oscillations. When the initial deviation exceeds some threshold, the trajectory demonstrates another type of the convergence to the equilibrium. At first, the trajectory goes away the equilibrium, performs large-amplitude loop, and only after this outlying excursion begins to approach to the equilibrium. A similar behavior associated with the presence of the threshold is also observed in the case of the stable limit cycle [see Fig. 2(b) for p = 1.28]. Such foliating of the phase trajectories can be interpreted as a transient bistability of the Higgins model in the considered parametric zone.
These peculiarities of the deterministic Higgins model result in the variety of the dynamic regimes in the presence of random disturbances.
III. STOCHASTIC MODEL
Consider an impact of the additive noise modeling by the following stochastic system:
where ξ_{1}(t) and ξ_{2}(t) are uncorrelated standard white Gaussian noises with parameters Eξ_{i}(t)=0,Eξ_{i}(t)ξ_{i}(τ)=δ(t−τ), and ε_{1,2} are noise intensities. In what follows, we put ε_{1}=ε_{2}=ε.
A. Noise-induced excitability in the zone of stable equilibria
Consider how noise affects the equilibrium of system (1) with q=0.2,p=1.1. For weak noise, trajectories of the stochastically forced system (2) leave the equilibrium and oscillate in a small vicinity of it (see Fig. 3 for ε=0.01, blue color). In this case, the system demonstrates small-amplitude stochastic oscillations (SASO). With increasing noise, the dispersion of these stochastic oscillations grows. But due to the above mentioned peculiarities of the deterministic phase portrait and the presence of the threshold of initial deviation, the stochastic trajectories fall into the super-threshold zone and demonstrate large-amplitude loops. In this case, the alternation of SASO and large-amplitude stochastic oscillations (LASO) is observed (see Fig. 3 for ε=0.03, red color). It could be interpreted as a noise-induced bistability with the generation of stochastic cycles in the zone of stable equilibria.
So, the stochastic system exhibits a phenomenon of the stochastic excitability. As one can see, large-amplitude glycolytic oscillations can be observed not only in the zone of limit cycles but also in the zone of stable equilibria as a result of the stochastic forcing. Details of the transition from SASO to LASO regime are shown in Fig. 4. A sharp change of the dispersion of random states under increasing noise can be seen in Fig. 4(a). Here, y-coordinates of system (2) solutions are plotted versus noise intensity ε.
Noise-induced deformations of frequency characteristics of the system (2) solutions are shown in Fig. 4(b). Here, we compare the plots of the normalized power spectral density s(ω) for different noise intensities. For weak noise (ε=0.01), one can see a single dominating peak corresponding to the frequency ω=0.067 of damped oscillations defined by the imaginary part of the eigenvalues of the Jacobi matrix of stable equilibrium. An increasing noise results in the appearance of the new dominating peak of s(ω) for smaller frequency. This peak corresponds to the frequency of LASO.
Being observed in the stochastic Higgins model, the alternation of SASO and LASO can be specified as so-called bursting regime. Indeed, here one can see a combination of quiescence (SASO) and spiking (LASO) intervals. Statistics of the interspike intervals τ are shown in Figs. 4(c) and 4(d) where mean values ⟨τ⟩ and variances D(τ) are plotted versus noise intensity ε. As one can see, the onset of LASO is accompanied by a sharp drop and further stabilization of the mean values of interspike intervals. The plot of the variance D has a distinct minimum near ε=0.1. For this noise intensity, a dispersion of the frequency of large-amplitude spikes is minimal, so these LASO are most coherent. This phenomenon is known as a coherence resonance [26,27]. This is confirmed by the one-peak plot of the power spectral density in Fig. 4(b) (green color).
These phenomena obtained by the direct numerical simulations of solutions of system (2) can be studied analytically with the help of the stochastic sensitivity function technique and confidence domains method (see the Appendix for details). In the study of the transition from SASO to LASO, one has to take into account three factors, namely, the stochastic sensitivity of the forced stable equilibrium, the noise intensity, and the discussed above threshold value of the deviation from the equilibrium.
For the equilibrium (1, 1) of the deterministic system (1), the Jacobi matrix is
The stochastic sensitivity matrix
of this equilibrium in system (2) is a solution of Eq. (A3). This matrix has the following elements:
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix characterize the spatial arrangement of the confidence ellipse around the equilibrium, and the noise intensity ε defines its size. Consider how confidence ellipses can be used in the analysis of the transition from SASO to LASO.
For small noise, the confidence ellipses belong to the subthreshold zone. As the noise intensity increases, these ellipses expand and start to occupy the superthreshold zone. Such scenario is shown in Fig. 5 where confidence ellipses with the fiducial probability P=0.999 are plotted for ε=0.01 (blue) and ε=0.03 (red). Here, the small ellipse with ε=0.01 lies entirely in the subthreshold zone, so the generation of LASO does not occur. Some part of the interior of the large ellipse with ε=0.03 resides in the superthreshold zone, where random trajectories are pushed out far from the equilibrium, and the system (2) exhibits the stochastic large-amplitude spikes. As one can see, this scenario is in a good agreement with results of the direct numerical simulations (see Figs. 3 and 4).
B. Noise-induced phenomena in the zone of stable cycles
Consider now how noise affects the limit cycles of system (1) in the zone p>q+1. When the parameter p passes the AH bifurcation point p_{AH}=q+1 from the left to the right, the equilibrium loses the stability and the stable limit cycle is born. As the noise intensity increases, the size of this cycle increases too. However, the character of these changes and dynamic properties of corresponding cycles essentially depend on the value of the parameter q. For the small value of q, the Canard-like explosion is observed [see the bifurcation diagram in Fig. 1(b)]. In Fig. 6(a), for q = 0.2, it is shown how the form of cycles depends on the parameter p. With increasing p, the cycle expands and becomes close to triangle. The value p_{*}=1.28985 corresponds to the Canard explosion.
In the further study, a key role in the analysis of the noise-induced phenomena is played by the stochastic sensitivity functions of these cycles. Mathematical details of the SSF technique for limit cycles can be found in the Appendix. Consider how the stochastic sensitivity function m(t) of these cycles depends on the parameter p changes. In Fig. 6(b), for q = 0.2, plots of the function m(t) are shown for different values of p. First of all, it can be noted that the stochastic sensitivity function is highly non-uniform along the cycles for any fixed p. The maximum overfall of its values is observed for p_{*}=1.28985, where the M=maxm(t)≈9·10^{10}. So, for p=p_{*}, the Canard cycle is supersensitive to noise. The function M(p) is plotted for q = 1 in Fig. 7(a) and for q = 0.2 in Fig. 7(b). As one can see, the function M(p) for q = 1 changes quite regular, but for q = 0.2, this function has a sharp narrow peak at p=p_{*}.
Consider how the random noise affects the limit cycles for q = 0.2 and values p close to p_{*}. In Fig. 8, we consider an influence of noise on cycles with p = 1.28 and p = 1.3. Here, random trajectories are shown by green, and corresponding deterministic unforced cycles are plotted by blue color.
For weak noise with ε=10^{−4}, trajectories of the stochastic system (2) are arranged near unforced deterministic cycles. The increasing noise qualitatively changes a distribution of random trajectories. For p = 1.28 and ε=10^{−2}, random trajectories are localised in two distinct zones: inside the deterministic cycle near the unstable equilibrium and far from the deterministic cycle, where a new stochastic cycle of the large amplitude appears. So, here the phenomenon of the noise-induced splitting of the stochastic cycle is observed. A corresponding transformation in the probability distribution of the random trajectories of the stochastic system (2) with p = 1.3 is shown for ε=10^{−2}. Here, one can see two similar distinct zones: random trajectories are concentrated near the unstable equilibrium or form a new stochastic cycle with a slightly smaller amplitude.
It is interesting to compare these results with the case where the noise acts on the supersensitive cycle with p_{*}=1.28985. In Fig. 9, we demonstrate a response of this cycle to the noise of the four different intensities. Here, one can see how a concentrated stochastic cycle splits into two separate bundles. With the increasing noise, one of these bundles decreases, and the other one grows. So, the bifurcation of the splitting of the one-bundle stochastic cycle into two-bundle stochastic cycle is observed. It should be noted that because of the super-sensitivity of the initial deterministic cycle, the noise intensity corresponding to this splitting bifurcation is extremely small.
These amplitude changes are accompanied by the corresponding deformations of the frequency. In Fig. 9 (bottom panel), the plots of the normalized power spectral density s(ω) for different noise intensities are shown. For weak noise (ε=10^{−6}), one can see a single dominating peak corresponding to the frequency of oscillations defined by the deterministic limit cycle. An increasing noise results in the transformation of this one-peak curve to two-peak curve with two dominating frequencies. These frequencies (see Fig. 9 for ε=10^{−4}) correspond to the two modes of the two-bundle stochastic cycle that appears as a result of the noise-induced splitting.
Consider now how the phenomenon of the noise-induced splitting can be analysed by the SSF technique and the confidence domains method. In Fig. 10(a), the external borders (dashed lines) of the confidence bands around the deterministic limit cycle (pink color) are shown. Here, the bands are compared for two values of the noise intensity. For small noise ε=0.0003 (blue color), the confidence band entirely belong to the subthreshold zone. For larger noise ε=0.001 (red color), this band occupies the superthreshold zone. Such occupation can be used for the estimation of the noise intensity corresponding to the onset of the noise-induced splitting. The validity of this approach is confirmed by results of the direct numerical simulation shown in Fig. 10(b).
IV. NOISE-INDUCED TRANSITIONS FROM ORDER TO CHAOS
In the study of noise-induced phenomena in Higgins model, along with the analysis of stochastic transformations of amplitudes and frequencies of mixed-mode oscillations, it is highly important to consider changes in the mutual arrangement of random trajectories in stochastic flows. Here, as a quantitative measure, the Lyapunov exponents are traditionally used [44]. If the largest Lyapunov exponent Λ is negative, then the stochastic trajectories mostly converge, and the flow is regular. The positiveness of Λ means the divergence of trajectories, and as a consequence, the flow is chaotic. A change of the sign of Λ from minus to plus is a standard criterion of the transition from order to chaos.
Consider how a behavior of the largest Lyapunov exponent Λ depends on the noise intensity ε in the zone of Canard cycles. In Fig. 11, plots Λ(ε) are shown for three values of the parameter p: for p=1.28<p_{*}, for p=p_{*}=1.28985, and for p=1.3>p_{*}. Qualitatively, these functions are similar: at first, Λ(ε) decreases, and after that it begins to increase, and changes its sign from minus to plus. Thus, the noise-induced transition from order to chaos is a common feature of Canard cycles. It should be noted that the critical value of the noise intensity corresponding to such order-chaos transition essentially depends on the stochastic sensitivity. Here, for the super-sensitive cycle with p=p_{*}=1.28985, such transition occurs at much lower, practically background noise.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, a phenomenon of the noise-induced oscillatory multistability was studied on the base of the well-known Higgins model. It was a first model that clarified mechanisms of the appearance of self-oscillations in glycolysis. We used this conceptual model to show how noise can complicate oscillatory regimes and transform the system from mono- to bistability. We considered a variety of noise-induced phenomena in parametric zones of equilibria and limit cycles. In the zone of stable equilibria, the noise-induced excitability with the transition from small- to large-amplitude stochastic oscillations was analysed with the help of the power spectral density and statistics of interspike intervals. Here, a phenomenon of the coherence resonance was discovered. For the analytical study of the noise-induced oscillatory bistability, the stochastic sensitivity function technique and method of confidence domains were used. In the zone of stable cycles, supersensitive Canard-type cycles were localised and studied. Here, a probabilistic mechanism of the noise-induced splitting of stochastic cycles was discussed. It was shown that the noise-induced oscillatory multistability is accompanied by transitions from order to chaos. It is worth noting that similar phenomena of the explosive appearance of large-amplitude stochastic oscillations are observed in dynamic models of neural activity [21,45], population [46–48] and climate [49] dynamics, and chemical kinetics [50,51].
In the investigation of complex dynamic phenomena, an important role is played by simple so-called conceptual models, which help us to understand the internal mechanisms of possible regimes, and identify the main factors that influence the changes of these regimes. Among the variety of biochemical reactions, the glycolysis is one of the well-known reactions. The most interesting phenomena in glycolysis are connected with oscillatory regimes. The two-dimensional Higgins model is one of the first mathematical models explaining the nature of glycolytic oscillations. In the framework of the deterministic theory, more complicated multistable regular and chaotic regimes can be described with the help of the dynamic models of higher dimensions. However, using stochastic systems, one can model new unexpected dynamic phenomena remaining within the framework of low-dimensional models. The aim of this paper is to show how an inevitable noise can vary and complicate oscillatory phenomena, even in the simple Higgins model. A theoretical approach based on the stochastic sensitivity function is discussed and applied to the analysis of these phenomena.
A complexity in the oscillatory behavior of the dynamic systems is usually associated with a combination of fast and slow phases, different amplitudes and frequencies, and regular and chaotic regimes. In reality, oscillations rarely are harmonic, but typically demonstrate various non-uniformities. Such mixed-mode oscillations (MMO) are ubiquitous in nature and have been observed in chemical reactions [1–4], neurodynamics [5–7], electronics [8,9], population dynamics [10], and so on. Mathematically, an appearance of MMOs can be explained by the strong nonlinearity, local and global bifurcations, fast-slow dynamics, and Canard-type phenomena [11–18].
A presence of noise substantially increases a variability of the MMOs [19] and generates unexpected phenomena that have no analogues in the deterministic case. Here, noise-induced transitions [20], stochastic excitability [21], noise-induced multistability, preference and annihilation of attractors [22–24], stochastic and coherence resonance [25–27], noise-induced synchronization [28,29] and chaos [30,31] are well known.
A problem of the explanation of intrinsic mechanisms of the complex oscillatory behavior of biochemical systems attracts attention of many researchers. Here, the first mathematical model was suggested by Higgins [32], who has linked an appearance of self-oscillations in the yeast glycolytic system with the existence of a limit cycle. Later, other specific and more complicated models of the glycolysis have been proposed [1,2,33–35]. Complex oscillatory regular and chaotic regimes in glycolysis were found in many-dimensional multistable dynamic models [36–41].
However, the complex behavior can be modeled by more simple conceptual, so-called minimal systems. The aim of this paper is to show that the Higgins model, even with the additive Gaussian noise, has the parametric zones where one can observe a variety of the complex dynamic phenomena, such as Canard-type cycles, stochastic excitability, coherence resonance, and noise-induced bistability with the generation of mixed-mode oscillations, splitting of stochastic cycles, and noise-induced transition to chaos.
In Sec. II, a short description of the dynamic regimes in the deterministic Higgins model is given. Here, a parametric zone of Canard-type explosion of limit cycles is found.
In Sec. III, we consider a variety of noise-induced phenomena in the stochastically forced Higgins model. At first, a phenomenon of the noise-induced excitability in the zone of stable equilibria is studied. Here, a transition from small-amplitude stochastic oscillations (SASO) to large-amplitude stochastic oscillations (LASO) with sharp spikes is analysed. Such noise-induced bistability with stochastic MMOs is studied with the help of the power spectral density and statistics of interspike intervals. A phenomenon of the coherence resonance is discussed. For the analytical study of the noise-induced bistability, the stochastic sensitivity function technique [42,45] and constructive method of confidence ellipses are applied. Elements of this technique are briefly presented in the Appendix.
Further, we study the effect of noise on limit cycles. Here, a parametric zone with a high stochastic sensitivity of cycles is localized, and a supersensitive Canard-type cycle is found. A phenomenon of the noise-induced splitting of stochastic cycles is demonstrated and investigated with the help of the power spectral density and confidence bands.
In Sec. IV, it is shown that the generation of MMOs is accompanied by the noise-induced transitions from order to chaos. Here, Lyapunov exponents are analysed in the zone of the Canard-type explosion.
Consider the deterministic Higgins model [32,43]
with positive parameters p and q. The system (1) is one of the first mathematical models of a product-activated and substrate-inhibited reaction of glycolysis. Here, x and y are dimensionless concentrations of the substrate and product, respectively.
In this model, oscillatory regimes appear as a result of the transition from the equilibrium to limit cycle through the Andronov – Hopf (AH) bifurcation. In two-parametric space, the line p=q+1 marks this AH bifurcation. For 0<p<q+1, the system (1) has a unique stable equilibrium x¯=y¯=1. For p>q+1, this equilibrium is unstable, and the system (1) exhibits a stable limit cycle.
In Fig. 1, bifurcation diagrams of the system (1) are presented for two values of the parameter q. Here, extreme values of y-coordinates of attractors are shown. As one can see, for q = 1 [see Fig. 1(a)], the amplitude of self-oscillations uniformly increases with increasing p. However, for smaller q, in this dependence, a new essential feature appears. As one can see in Fig. 1(b) for q = 0.2, there is a zone of Canard explosion, where the amplitude of the oscillations sharply increases.
In the zone of small q, the model has other important peculiarities associated with the irregular arrangement of the phase trajectories near the attractors. In Fig. 2 for q = 0.2, the cases of the stable equilibrium (p = 1.1) and the stable limit cycle (p = 1.28) are shown. Note that for q = 0.2, the point of AH bifurcation is p = 1.2. As can be seen in Fig. 2(a), for small initial deviations from the stable equilibrium, the phase trajectory tends to the equilibrium with damped oscillations. When the initial deviation exceeds some threshold, the trajectory demonstrates another type of the convergence to the equilibrium. At first, the trajectory goes away the equilibrium, performs large-amplitude loop, and only after this outlying excursion begins to approach to the equilibrium. A similar behavior associated with the presence of the threshold is also observed in the case of the stable limit cycle [see Fig. 2(b) for p = 1.28]. Such foliating of the phase trajectories can be interpreted as a transient bistability of the Higgins model in the considered parametric zone.
These peculiarities of the deterministic Higgins model result in the variety of the dynamic regimes in the presence of random disturbances.
Consider an impact of the additive noise modeling by the following stochastic system:
where ξ_{1}(t) and ξ_{2}(t) are uncorrelated standard white Gaussian noises with parameters Eξ_{i}(t)=0,Eξ_{i}(t)ξ_{i}(τ)=δ(t−τ), and ε_{1,2} are noise intensities. In what follows, we put ε_{1}=ε_{2}=ε.
Consider how noise affects the equilibrium of system (1) with q=0.2,p=1.1. For weak noise, trajectories of the stochastically forced system (2) leave the equilibrium and oscillate in a small vicinity of it (see Fig. 3 for ε=0.01, blue color). In this case, the system demonstrates small-amplitude stochastic oscillations (SASO). With increasing noise, the dispersion of these stochastic oscillations grows. But due to the above mentioned peculiarities of the deterministic phase portrait and the presence of the threshold of initial deviation, the stochastic trajectories fall into the super-threshold zone and demonstrate large-amplitude loops. In this case, the alternation of SASO and large-amplitude stochastic oscillations (LASO) is observed (see Fig. 3 for ε=0.03, red color). It could be interpreted as a noise-induced bistability with the generation of stochastic cycles in the zone of stable equilibria.
So, the stochastic system exhibits a phenomenon of the stochastic excitability. As one can see, large-amplitude glycolytic oscillations can be observed not only in the zone of limit cycles but also in the zone of stable equilibria as a result of the stochastic forcing. Details of the transition from SASO to LASO regime are shown in Fig. 4. A sharp change of the dispersion of random states under increasing noise can be seen in Fig. 4(a). Here, y-coordinates of system (2) solutions are plotted versus noise intensity ε.
Noise-induced deformations of frequency characteristics of the system (2) solutions are shown in Fig. 4(b). Here, we compare the plots of the normalized power spectral density s(ω) for different noise intensities. For weak noise (ε=0.01), one can see a single dominating peak corresponding to the frequency ω=0.067 of damped oscillations defined by the imaginary part of the eigenvalues of the Jacobi matrix of stable equilibrium. An increasing noise results in the appearance of the new dominating peak of s(ω) for smaller frequency. This peak corresponds to the frequency of LASO.
Being observed in the stochastic Higgins model, the alternation of SASO and LASO can be specified as so-called bursting regime. Indeed, here one can see a combination of quiescence (SASO) and spiking (LASO) intervals. Statistics of the interspike intervals τ are shown in Figs. 4(c) and 4(d) where mean values ⟨τ⟩ and variances D(τ) are plotted versus noise intensity ε. As one can see, the onset of LASO is accompanied by a sharp drop and further stabilization of the mean values of interspike intervals. The plot of the variance D has a distinct minimum near ε=0.1. For this noise intensity, a dispersion of the frequency of large-amplitude spikes is minimal, so these LASO are most coherent. This phenomenon is known as a coherence resonance [26,27]. This is confirmed by the one-peak plot of the power spectral density in Fig. 4(b) (green color).
These phenomena obtained by the direct numerical simulations of solutions of system (2) can be studied analytically with the help of the stochastic sensitivity function technique and confidence domains method (see the Appendix for details). In the study of the transition from SASO to LASO, one has to take into account three factors, namely, the stochastic sensitivity of the forced stable equilibrium, the noise intensity, and the discussed above threshold value of the deviation from the equilibrium.
For the equilibrium (1, 1) of the deterministic system (1), the Jacobi matrix is
The stochastic sensitivity matrix
of this equilibrium in system (2) is a solution of Eq. (A3). This matrix has the following elements:
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix characterize the spatial arrangement of the confidence ellipse around the equilibrium, and the noise intensity ε defines its size. Consider how confidence ellipses can be used in the analysis of the transition from SASO to LASO.
For small noise, the confidence ellipses belong to the subthreshold zone. As the noise intensity increases, these ellipses expand and start to occupy the superthreshold zone. Such scenario is shown in Fig. 5 where confidence ellipses with the fiducial probability P=0.999 are plotted for ε=0.01 (blue) and ε=0.03 (red). Here, the small ellipse with ε=0.01 lies entirely in the subthreshold zone, so the generation of LASO does not occur. Some part of the interior of the large ellipse with ε=0.03 resides in the superthreshold zone, where random trajectories are pushed out far from the equilibrium, and the system (2) exhibits the stochastic large-amplitude spikes. As one can see, this scenario is in a good agreement with results of the direct numerical simulations (see Figs. 3 and 4).
Consider now how noise affects the limit cycles of system (1) in the zone p>q+1. When the parameter p passes the AH bifurcation point p_{AH}=q+1 from the left to the right, the equilibrium loses the stability and the stable limit cycle is born. As the noise intensity increases, the size of this cycle increases too. However, the character of these changes and dynamic properties of corresponding cycles essentially depend on the value of the parameter q. For the small value of q, the Canard-like explosion is observed [see the bifurcation diagram in Fig. 1(b)]. In Fig. 6(a), for q = 0.2, it is shown how the form of cycles depends on the parameter p. With increasing p, the cycle expands and becomes close to triangle. The value p_{*}=1.28985 corresponds to the Canard explosion.
In the further study, a key role in the analysis of the noise-induced phenomena is played by the stochastic sensitivity functions of these cycles. Mathematical details of the SSF technique for limit cycles can be found in the Appendix. Consider how the stochastic sensitivity function m(t) of these cycles depends on the parameter p changes. In Fig. 6(b), for q = 0.2, plots of the function m(t) are shown for different values of p. First of all, it can be noted that the stochastic sensitivity function is highly non-uniform along the cycles for any fixed p. The maximum overfall of its values is observed for p_{*}=1.28985, where the M=maxm(t)≈9·10^{10}. So, for p=p_{*}, the Canard cycle is supersensitive to noise. The function M(p) is plotted for q = 1 in Fig. 7(a) and for q = 0.2 in Fig. 7(b). As one can see, the function M(p) for q = 1 changes quite regular, but for q = 0.2, this function has a sharp narrow peak at p=p_{*}.
Consider how the random noise affects the limit cycles for q = 0.2 and values p close to p_{*}. In Fig. 8, we consider an influence of noise on cycles with p = 1.28 and p = 1.3. Here, random trajectories are shown by green, and corresponding deterministic unforced cycles are plotted by blue color.
For weak noise with ε=10^{−4}, trajectories of the stochastic system (2) are arranged near unforced deterministic cycles. The increasing noise qualitatively changes a distribution of random trajectories. For p = 1.28 and ε=10^{−2}, random trajectories are localised in two distinct zones: inside the deterministic cycle near the unstable equilibrium and far from the deterministic cycle, where a new stochastic cycle of the large amplitude appears. So, here the phenomenon of the noise-induced splitting of the stochastic cycle is observed. A corresponding transformation in the probability distribution of the random trajectories of the stochastic system (2) with p = 1.3 is shown for ε=10^{−2}. Here, one can see two similar distinct zones: random trajectories are concentrated near the unstable equilibrium or form a new stochastic cycle with a slightly smaller amplitude.
It is interesting to compare these results with the case where the noise acts on the supersensitive cycle with p_{*}=1.28985. In Fig. 9, we demonstrate a response of this cycle to the noise of the four different intensities. Here, one can see how a concentrated stochastic cycle splits into two separate bundles. With the increasing noise, one of these bundles decreases, and the other one grows. So, the bifurcation of the splitting of the one-bundle stochastic cycle into two-bundle stochastic cycle is observed. It should be noted that because of the super-sensitivity of the initial deterministic cycle, the noise intensity corresponding to this splitting bifurcation is extremely small.
These amplitude changes are accompanied by the corresponding deformations of the frequency. In Fig. 9 (bottom panel), the plots of the normalized power spectral density s(ω) for different noise intensities are shown. For weak noise (ε=10^{−6}), one can see a single dominating peak corresponding to the frequency of oscillations defined by the deterministic limit cycle. An increasing noise results in the transformation of this one-peak curve to two-peak curve with two dominating frequencies. These frequencies (see Fig. 9 for ε=10^{−4}) correspond to the two modes of the two-bundle stochastic cycle that appears as a result of the noise-induced splitting.
Consider now how the phenomenon of the noise-induced splitting can be analysed by the SSF technique and the confidence domains method. In Fig. 10(a), the external borders (dashed lines) of the confidence bands around the deterministic limit cycle (pink color) are shown. Here, the bands are compared for two values of the noise intensity. For small noise ε=0.0003 (blue color), the confidence band entirely belong to the subthreshold zone. For larger noise ε=0.001 (red color), this band occupies the superthreshold zone. Such occupation can be used for the estimation of the noise intensity corresponding to the onset of the noise-induced splitting. The validity of this approach is confirmed by results of the direct numerical simulation shown in Fig. 10(b).
In the study of noise-induced phenomena in Higgins model, along with the analysis of stochastic transformations of amplitudes and frequencies of mixed-mode oscillations, it is highly important to consider changes in the mutual arrangement of random trajectories in stochastic flows. Here, as a quantitative measure, the Lyapunov exponents are traditionally used [44]. If the largest Lyapunov exponent Λ is negative, then the stochastic trajectories mostly converge, and the flow is regular. The positiveness of Λ means the divergence of trajectories, and as a consequence, the flow is chaotic. A change of the sign of Λ from minus to plus is a standard criterion of the transition from order to chaos.
Consider how a behavior of the largest Lyapunov exponent Λ depends on the noise intensity ε in the zone of Canard cycles. In Fig. 11, plots Λ(ε) are shown for three values of the parameter p: for p=1.28<p_{*}, for p=p_{*}=1.28985, and for p=1.3>p_{*}. Qualitatively, these functions are similar: at first, Λ(ε) decreases, and after that it begins to increase, and changes its sign from minus to plus. Thus, the noise-induced transition from order to chaos is a common feature of Canard cycles. It should be noted that the critical value of the noise intensity corresponding to such order-chaos transition essentially depends on the stochastic sensitivity. Here, for the super-sensitive cycle with p=p_{*}=1.28985, such transition occurs at much lower, practically background noise.
In this paper, a phenomenon of the noise-induced oscillatory multistability was studied on the base of the well-known Higgins model. It was a first model that clarified mechanisms of the appearance of self-oscillations in glycolysis. We used this conceptual model to show how noise can complicate oscillatory regimes and transform the system from mono- to bistability. We considered a variety of noise-induced phenomena in parametric zones of equilibria and limit cycles. In the zone of stable equilibria, the noise-induced excitability with the transition from small- to large-amplitude stochastic oscillations was analysed with the help of the power spectral density and statistics of interspike intervals. Here, a phenomenon of the coherence resonance was discovered. For the analytical study of the noise-induced oscillatory bistability, the stochastic sensitivity function technique and method of confidence domains were used. In the zone of stable cycles, supersensitive Canard-type cycles were localised and studied. Here, a probabilistic mechanism of the noise-induced splitting of stochastic cycles was discussed. It was shown that the noise-induced oscillatory multistability is accompanied by transitions from order to chaos. It is worth noting that similar phenomena of the explosive appearance of large-amplitude stochastic oscillations are observed in dynamic models of neural activity [21,45], population [46–48] and climate [49] dynamics, and chemical kinetics [50,51].
APPENDIX: STOCHASTIC SENSITIVITY AND CONFIDENCE DOMAINS
Consider a nonlinear system of stochastic differential equations,
where x is n-vector, f(x) is n-vector function, σ(x) is n × m-matrix function, ξ(t) is a white Gaussian m-vector noise with parameters ⟨ξ(t)⟩=0,⟨ξ(t)ξ(τ)⟩=δ(t−τ)I, and ε is a scalar parameter of the noise intensity.
Under stochastic forcing, random trajectories of the system (A1) form some probabilistic distribution around the deterministic attractor. For the descriptive presentation of geometrical peculiarities of this distribution, it is convenient to use confidence domains.
In two-dimensional case, the corresponding confidence ellipse around the stable equilibrium x¯ is defined by the equation
where ε is a noise intensity, k=−ln(1−P), and P is a fiducial probability. Here, the stochastic sensitivity matrix W is a solution of the equation
Equation (A2) can be written in canonical form
where μ_{1},μ_{2} are eigenvalues, u_{1}, u_{2} are normalized eigenvectors of the matrix W, and z_{1}=(x−x¯,u_{1}),z_{2}=(x−x¯,u_{2}) are coordinates of the confidence ellipse in the basis of u_{1}, u_{2}, with the origin at the point x¯.
Consider now a confidence domain near the stable limit cycle defined by T-periodic solution x=ξ(t) of the corresponding deterministic system. In two-dimensional case, boundaries x_{1,2}(t) of this confidence band can be written in an explicit parametric form,
Here, the parameter k is connected with the fiducial probability P by the formula k=erf^{−1}(P), where erf(x)=2π∫0xe^{−t2}dt is the error function. The stochastic sensitivity function μ(t) of this cycle is governed by the following boundary problem:
with T-periodic coefficients
where
and p(t) is a normalized vector that is orthogonal to f(ξ(t)).
Confidence ellipses and bands were successfully applied for the analysis of backward stochastic bifurcations [52], the noise-induced transitions to chaos [53], stochastic phenomena in neurons [45], and dynamics of traveling waves [54].
