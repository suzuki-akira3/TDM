Large hh-lh splitting energy for InAs/AlSb/GaSb based N-structure photodetectors
We investigate the band properties of InAs/AlSb/GaSb (N-structure) and InAs/GaSb material based type II superlattice (T2SL) photodedectors. The superlattice empirical pseudopotential method is used to define band-structures such as the bandgap and heavy hole-light hole (hh-lh) splitting energies in the mid-wavelength infrared range (MWIR) and long wavelength range (LWIR). The calculations are carried out on the variation of AlSb/GaSb layer thickness for (InAs)_{10.5}/(AlSb)_{x}/(GaSb)_{9-x} and the variation of InAs layer thickness for (InAs)_{x}/(AlSb)_{3}/(GaSb)_{6} T2SL structures at 77 K. For the same bandgap energy of 229 meV (5.4 μm in wavelength), hh-lh splitting energy is calculated as 194 meV for the (InAs)_{7.5}/(AlSb)_{3}/(GaSb)_{6} structure compared to the (InAs)_{10.5}/(GaSb)_{9} structure with hh-lh splitting energy of 91 meV within the MWIR. Long wavelength performance of InAs/AlSb/GaSb structure shows superior electronic properties over the standard InAs/GaSb T2SL structure with larger hh-lh splitting energy which is larger than the bandgap energy. The best result is obtained for (InAs)_{17}/(AlSb)_{3}/(GaSb)_{6} with the minimum bandgap of 128 meV with hh-lh splitting energy of 194 meV, which is important for suppressing the Auger recombination process. These values are very promising for a photodetector design in both MWIR and LWIR in high temperature applications.
I. INTRODUCTION
The InAs/AlSb/GaSb material system known as 6.1 Å family is highly desirable for a high performance type II superlattice (T2SL) photodetector design operating in the high temperature infrared applications. Especially, the N-structure design (Fig. 1) has been realized as a proper combination of constituent alloys of a thin AlSb layer as a unipolar electron barrier placed in between InAs and GaSb layers within the T2SL pin photodetector formation operating in the mid-wavelength infrared regime (MWIR), and it has been investigated both theoretically and experimentally [1–3]. For the same wavelength, it has been shown that N-structure T2SL has superior electrical and optical properties such as low dark current density, high quantum efficiency, and detectivity [4]. On the other hand, electronic properties such as hh–lh splitting and bandgap energies have been investigated using first principles calculations taking into account InSb and AlAs as possible interface (IF) transition alloys between AlSb/InAs layers and individual layer thicknesses of GaSb, InAs, and AlSb [5]. However, thickness of period in the SL cannot be increased using this method since this results in too many atoms or monolayers (MLs) to construct a period of structure in the calculations. Therefore, the calculation is limited only to detector designs in the near infrared range (NIR) and higher energy side of MWIR. Band-structure calculations of a typical InAs/GaSb T2SL have also been studied by the k.p method and modified Envelope Function Approximation (EFA) at (k = 0) [6]. Depending on IF interactions, k.p and EFA methods have been used to understand band characteristics of SLs. It has been found that the type of IF affects e1-hh1 transitions [7,8]. It has been shown that InSb or GaAs-like IF transitions may be formed across InAs/GaSb IF instead of an abrupt transition [9]. InSb imposes a tensile strain while GaAs imposes compressive strain on the structure since the lattice constants of InSb and GaAs IF bonds are different [10]. In particular, it has been shown that the IF formations in the InAs/GaSb SL have an effect on the optical and electronic properties of the SL structure [7,11]. For the growth of InAs/GaSb T2SL, segregation of Sb (In) atoms to the surface in preference to As (Ga) induces the structural asymmetry which affects the electronic properties of the structure [12,13].
Another method is the Empirical Pseudopotential Method (EPM) which is very efficient for band-structure calculations on InAs/GaSb type-II SL with very thin layers. The method enables calculations for possible constituent IF states with an accuracy of a half a monolayer. The method furthermore allows accurate calculations with bulk atomic form factors. It can be said that these results are quite compatible with experimental results when effective masses are examined. In these calculations, strain is included in two different ways. In the first approach, form factors are obtained to form superlattice layers by band parameters of bulk constituent materials such as the electron and hole effective masses, bandgap energies, hh-lh splitting, and split-off band energies. Then, the obtained bandgap values are fit to optimize the experimentally measured energy gap (Eg) values of SL from photoluminescence (PL) and optical absorption measurements. Therefore, k-space band-structure for strained and unstrained SL systems is performed using these parameters [14]. In the second approach, in addition to previously optimized Eg values of SL structures (first method), the reciprocal lattice vectors for a substrate material are redefined with hydrostatic component of strain incorporation by modifying the lattice mismatch with elastic constants C_{11} and C_{12} and strain for the growth and in-plane directions (ε) [15]. In both cases, the gamma correction factor in the spin orbit term of the Hamiltonian matrix was taken to be the same as the bulk values.
In this work, band-structure calculation of InAs/AlSb/GaSb and InAs/GaSb based type-II SL structures is carried out using EPM. We used the first approach for EPM calculations to identify the strain term in the calculation. Lattice constant and AlSb MLs are obtained in order to get maximum hh-lh splitting that limits Auger recombination for a given cutoff wavelength. Also for the bulk structures form factors are obtained by bandgap and effective masses which are also measured experimentally by previous studies [16,17]. Finally, the bulk form factors are verified by non-local EPM calculations. The accuracy of our calculations was also confirmed by comparing with the results obtained by Dente and Tilton [18].
II. THEORETICAL BACKROUND OF SEPM
In a crystal, the motion of electrons depends on their interactions with ion cores. The electron near the ion cores has strong interaction with atomic potential. Here, electrons having much weaker interactions with ions are taken to account. Therefore, the smoother wave functions of electrons are used in our calculations for satisfying the nearly constant potential. According to Bloch's theorem, pseudo-wave function in the crystal and Bloch form periodic potential in terms of periodic reciprocal lattice vectors are given by
where the variable k is the wave vector of the system and g is the reciprocal lattice vector. The related lattice vectors are
where a is the lattice constant of the bulk material. Using these equations in the pseudo-Schrodinger equation, we can drive the reciprocal space form (Eq. (4)) of the equation. These reciprocal vectors are enough for calculation due to rapid decreasing of V_{g} with 1/g^{2}
Mass m in the Eq. (4) is not necessarily the bare mass of the electron. Between the cores, the electrons interact much weaker and the corresponding pseudowave functions of these electrons are more plane-like waves that are orthogonal to the core wave functions [19].
In the first three equations, the pseudopotential [Eq. (5)] term, which we denote as V_{g}, is written as a function of form factors as
We obtain the form factors (3 symmetric form factors + 3 anti-symmetric form factors) by fitting these parameters with respect to bandgap which comes from experimental results. We take these form factors for each bulk materials to use in the SL. If we treat Eq. (4) as an eigenvalue problem, the function of E(k) with respect to k gives us the band diagram.
We use fifteen reciprocal lattice vectors, g [Eq. (3)], in which g^{2} is less or equal to 11. Therefore, we deal with a 15 × 15 matrix. When we include the spin orbit interaction potential [Eq. (6)] as a perturbation term in the potential part of the Hamiltonian, we end up with a 30 × 30 matrix. The first 15 terms represent the spin up and the last 15 terms represent the spin down components
The constant Γ adjusts the spin-orbit split-off gap [15]. It is also an additional parameter which we have to fit with the other 6 parameters (form factors). This means that for any spin included bulk materials, we fit 7 parameters.
For the strained SL approach, we consider N different components in the superlattices. The repeated periods of thickness P are grown in the direction of [001]. The effective potential of SL given in Eq. (7) can be written as direct superposition of pseudopotential for each bulk constituent material [15]
The function rectzw is a periodic rectangle function [Eq. (8)] which we can write as a finite Fourier series. z_{i} is defined as below with Eq. (9), where w_{i} is the thickness of the i-th layer and V_{g}^{i} is the bulk pseudopotential of the i-th layer in one period of the SL
With this design of SL potential, we do not need any other parameters to take into account the strain effect [20]. We can mimic the transitions between layers with changing the cutoff coefficient M in the periodic rectangle function rectz_{i}w described in [Eq. (8)]. Note that we diagonalize the Hamiltonian matrix which is a 30(2 M + 1) X 30(2 M + 1) matrix.
Depending on the M value (M = 15 and M = 50), three constituent materials of InAs, AlSb, and GaSb were selected to show IF roughness in which their widths are 31.5, 9, and 27Å and potential heights are −0.510, −0.410, and 0 eV as given in Fig. 1, respectively. Subband energies for M = 15 and M = 50 were obtained to compare their accuracy. Square well combination of the SL is given by Fourier transform with constant M. Energy difference for same subband is about 0.05 meV for M = 15 and M = 50, for instance, where M value is an indication of the sharpness of the IF.
If we use Eqs. (8) and (9) in Eq. (7), we can write the superlattice pseudopotential {Eq. (11) using SL wavefunction [Eq. (10)]}
As a result, the matrix form of Hamiltonian [Eq. (12)] can be written in the form
where matrix elements are represented in the Appendix in detail.
The electronic band-structures for bulk constituent alloys of InAs, AlSb, and GaSb obtained from experimental measurements such as the PL and absorption measurements are fitted by EPM form factors. The input parameters for EPM calculations are listed in Table I given as form factors. Once band-structures of bulk constituents and their pseudopotential form factors are known, the extension of EPM simulations to T2SL is a straightforward calculation similar to that described by Dante and Tilton [15]. We note that the EPM calculation for the GaSb/InAs and InAs/AlSb/GaSb superlattice requires a band offset input as a constant value. We use these offsets instead of V_{g=0}^{i} for the i-th layer.
III. RESULTS
Interband transition energies of standard InAs/GaSb and InAs/AlSb/GaSb (N structure) based on T2SL have been obtained from the matrix form of Hamiltonian using a Superlattice empirical pseudopotential method (SEPM). The purpose of this study is to investigate and compare the band-structures considering bandgap and hh-lh splitting energies in terms of AlSb/GaSb and InAs layer thickness variations. Figure 2 shows the E(k) dispersion relation of standard InAs/GaSb T2SL for both the in-plane direction (k_{x}, k_{y}, or k_{⊥}) and parallel to the growth direction (k_{z}). The in-plane dispersion along [110] is shown on the left hand side of the figure, whereas the dispersion in the growth direction is shown on the right hand side of the figure. The layer thickness of the SL used in this study is 10.5 ML InAs and 9 ML GaSb, which leads to a bandgap energy of 229 meV. This corresponds to 5.4 μm in wavelength lying within the MWIR of atmospheric window. hh-lh splitting energy obtained from the band-structure is measured as 91 meV for this structure. Similar EPM calculations were conducted on an InAs/AlSb/GaSb (N-structure) T2SL as given with the same bandgap energy as the standard T2SL structure for comparison. Figure 3 shows the band-structure and energy dispersion relation for the (InAs)_{7.5}/(AlSb)_{3}/(GaSb)_{6} structure with its unique miniband characters such as relative position and ordering. The prominent difference in Fig. 3 is larger hh-lh splitting energy which is measured as 194 meV. As can be seen, bands are much more dispersive in plane directions of both T2SL structures as compared to the growth directions, which is consistent with other simulation methods such as 8 band k.p [21]. We also calculate bangap and hh-lh splitting energy as a function of AlSb layer thickness. Figure 4 shows the hh-lh splitting and bandgap energy for (InAs)_{10.5}/(AlSb)_{x}/(GaSb)_{9-x} T2SL structure with different x (ML) values. As AlSb layer thickness increases, hh-lh splitting energy increases from 90 to 242 meV, and then it decreases back to 90 meV. While bandgap energy (corresponding wavelength) gradually decreases (increases) with increasing AlSb layer thickness from 229 meV (5.4 μm) to 178 meV (7 μm), it increases rapidly up to 384 meV (3.22 μm). As the AlSb thickness increases band alignment shifts from type-II broken gap to type-II staggered line up. Bandgap energy curve shows that same energy value is obtained for SL structures with different AlSb layer thicknesses. In the figure, the letters A and B label the same bandgap value of 207 meV for AlSb layer thicknesses of 1 and 3.5 MLs. The corresponding hh-lh splitting energies are 138 meV for A and 242 meV for B. For more detailed investigation, calculated E(k) dispersion relations for both SL structures at the growth direction are depicted in Fig. 5, where c1-hh1 bands are overlapped. The relative light hole distributions along [001] are shown. The electron and hole effective masses are calculated by the band non-parabilicity for both structures, which are listed in Table II. In the table, no significant increase in electron effective masses for both in-plane and vertical directions is observed with increasing AlSb thickness in the superlattices. Therefore this has no effect on the supression of electron diffusion length and device performance. For a detector device, higher hh-lh splitting energy is important for suppressing the non-radiative electron-hole recombination to Auger recombination. This is crucial for high temperature detector applications [22]. We also investigate the mid- and long wavelength performances of InAs/AlSb/GaSb and standard InAs/GaSb T2SL structures as a function of InAs layer thicknesses. The layer composition of the SL structures is taken as (InAs)_{x}/(AlSb)_{3}/(GaSb)_{6} and (InAs)_{x}/(GaSb)_{9} where InAs layer thickness x varies from 6 to 19 ML. Figure 6 shows the effect of InAs thickness on bandgap and hh-lh splitting energies. Bandgap energies for both SL structures show descending behavior with increasing InAs layer thicknesses. The variation of Eg values for InAs/GaSb is higher than that for InAs/AlSb/GaSb T2SL with increasing InAs ML. For 6ML of InAs thickness, Eg values are calculated as 354 meV (corresponding 3.5 μm in wavelength) for (InAs)_{6}/(GaSb)_{9} SL and 248 meV (5 μm) for (InAs)_{6}/(AlSb)_{3}/(GaSb)_{6} T2SL, which are both within the MWIR. As InAs thickness is increased to 17 ML, Eg values of SL structures intersect at 124 meV with corresponding wavelength of 10 μm within the long wavelength range (LWIR). Other important parameters shown in the figure are hh-lh values for both T2LS structures. We obtain the hh-lh splitting energy as high as 195 meV regardless of InAs MLs for InAs/AlSb/GaSb T2SL structures. Interestingly, bandgap energy decreases below the hh-lh splitting energy as InAs ML increases. The variation reaches up to 74 meV at a wavelength of 10 μm. In other words, the energy difference between hh-lh and bandgap energy increases from MWIR to LWIR. This is a very important result for a detector structure design in the LWIR having hh-lh splitting energy larger than bandgap energy. As an illustration, Fig. 7 shows the band-structure and energy dispersion relation for 17 ML InAs, 3 ML AlSb, and 6 ML GaSb T2SL structure with 128 meV bandgap energy. This corresponds to 9.7 μm in wavelength. In Fig. 7, hh-lh splitting energy appears to be 195 meV which is prominently larger than the bandgap energy. As a result, the condition for suppression of Auger recombination (CHLH process) is satisfied in this long wavelength design of InAs/AlSb/GaSb structure, where bandgap energy is lower than hh-lh splitting energy. Therefore, the long wavelength performance of the InAs/AlSb/GaSb shows a promising behavior for higher operation temperatures.
IV. CONCLUSION
We have demonstrated the application pseudopotential method for InAs/GaSb and InAs/AlSb/GaSb T2SLs detector structures operating from MWIR to LWIR. Band-structure calculations show that the increase in AlSb thickness caused an increase in hh-lh splitting energy for the (InAs)_{10.5}/(AlSb)_{x}/(GaSb)_{9-x} T2SL structure. Furthermore, hh-lh splitting energy behavior for (InAs)_{x}/(AlSb)_{3}/(GaSb)_{6} structure reveals a constant value around 195 meV which is important for a bandgap comparison towards the LWIR. This motivates us for the manipulation of hh-lh splitting energy for a detector design operating in higher temperature applications. In a future work, IF effects will be included in our calculations.
