On genus-two solutions for the ILW equation
The existence of theta function solutions of genus two for the intermediate long-wave equation is established. A numerical example is also presented. The method basically goes along with Krichever’s construction of theta function solutions for soliton equations, such as the Kronecker product equation. This idea leads us to a question whether a Riemann surface exists which allows a peculiar abelian integral of the third kind. The answer is affirmative at least for genus-two curves.
I. INTRODUCTION
The intermediate long-wave (ILW) equation describes the propagation of long internal gravity waves in a stratified fluid of finite depth [1–3]. One of the standard dimensionless forms is as follows [4,5]:
Here, the slashed integral denotes Cauchy’s principal value of integral. The constant λ characterizes the relative depths of the two fluid layers. This study aims to find theta function solutions for the ILW equation (1). In the context of soliton theory, the phrase “theta function solutions” indicate peculiar families of solutions parametrized by compact Riemann surfaces. Such solutions have already been discovered for most of celebrated soliton equations. However, as for nonlocal soliton equations such as the ILW equation or the intermediate nonlinear Schrödinger equation, the only theta function solutions previously known were of a genus one type, i.e., elliptic solutions. Moreover, the construction of these elliptic solutions are heavily reliant upon properties specific to elliptic curves, making it difficult to find any hint of the existence of a greater-genus solutions. This paper explains the existence of theta function solutions of genus two for the ILW equation. The method takes the well-known approach of constructing a Baker-Akhiezer function which satisfies the Lax system—known as Krichever’s construction. Two ideas will be important in applying this standard technique. One is to write u as a difference of two holomorphic functions. An explanation of how this is achieved can be found in Sec. II. The other is to see Eq. (1) as a transcendental reduction of a higher dimensional integrable system. This higher dimensional system is introduced in Sec. III and its theta function solutions are exhibited in Sec. IV. The most difficult task is to find the theta function solutions which survive reduction to the ILW setting. This raises the question as to whether a Riemann surface exists which possesses a certain abelian integral of the third kind. It is proved in Sec. V that such genus-two Riemann surfaces exist. Since it is represented by a kind of transcendental equation, one can only show the existence of a solution and cannot describe it explicitly using known special functions. However, the method is nevertheless constructive, and the form of the solution is almost explicit. In Sec. VI, a numerical example of the solution is given. Section VII is devoted to further discussion.
II. SUITABLE DIFFERENTIAL-DIFFERENCE FORM
The derivation of the ILW equation from the basic fluid dynamical equations assumes that u vanishes at |x| → ∞. Under this boundary condition, multi-soliton solutions were discovered by Joseph [1,2] and subsequently obtained in other several ways by Chen and Lee [6], Matsuno [7], and Kodama et_al [8] The spatially periodic boundary condition has also been studied intensively. Although with the original derivation of the equation we might not expect a periodic solution, the numerical work of Kubota et_al first suggested that such solutions exist [3]. After this, precise expressions for periodic solutions were found [5,9,10]. In these preceding studies, the ILW equation is always transformed into a differential-difference equation so as to avoid handling the singular integral term directly [4,6,11]. Namely, the transformed equation contains both differentials and differences about x and does not contain any singular integral terms. If we try to rewrite (1) as such a differential-difference equation, there is no chance to reutilize the technique for the spatially decaying boundary condition or periodic boundary condition, since theta function solutions of genus two are neither decaying nor periodic. However, it is real analytic and bounded on the entire real axis. Therefore, the following lemma provides the key to introducing a complex difference.
Lemma 1. Let f(x) be a real analytic function and be bounded on the real axis. Then, the following equation holds,
Proof. Since f is bounded, it is expressible as follows by means of the integration by parts formula,
Substituting the above into the second term of the l.h.s. of (2), one arrives at the r.h.s.Next, let us introduce the following complex valued function:
Here, α is an arbitrarily fixed constant. Then, we denote the analytic continuation of this function to the real axis from the upper (lower) half plain as
This shows that the following properties hold.
Remark 2. 
1. A^{+}(x + 4i/λ) = A^{−}(x).
2. A^{+} is holomorphic in the strip 0 < Im(z) < 4/λ and A^{−} is holomorphic in the strip −4/λ < Im(z) < 0.Conversely, we can construct u from A^{±} by virtue of the following lemma.
Lemma 3. Let f^{+}(z) be a complex function holomorphic in the strip 0 < Im(z) < 4/λ and f^{−}(z) ≔ f^{+}(z + 4i/λ). Suppose both f^{±}(z) and fz±(z) are bounded when Re(z) → ±∞. Then, the following equation holds,
Proof. Let S be an integration contour shown in Fig. 1. Then, with the help of Lemma 1, we can consider the following calculation:
which establishes formula (5).
Making use of this lemma, Eq. (1) can be rewritten into the following differential equation with a complex difference in the variable x:
It should be emphasized again that if one finds a solution A^{±} for (6) which satisfies the assumptions of Lemma 3, then u(x)=i2(A^{−}−A^{+}) becomes a solution for Eq. (1). This was the strategy used to solve Eq. (1).
III. AUXILIARY LAX SYSTEM
Equation (6) is usually called 1 + 1-dimensional because it contains one spatial variable x and one time variable t. But, it is sometimes revealing to regard it as a reduction from the following 2 + 1-dimensional equation that contains another spatial independent variable, specifically, r,
Here, c is a certain complex constant. It looks very much like Eq. (6) but this time Ã denotes a shift in the r-direction, Ã(x, t, r) ≔ A(x, t, r + Δ), where Δ is a complex constant. In this section, a Lax system associated with this 2 + 1-dimensional equation is presented. The strategy is that, if one finds a solution for (7) whose r-dependence is of the form A(t, x + 4ir/λΔ), it also becomes a solution for (6) as well because the r-shift can take the place of the x-shift. It should be noted that the notion of regarding the ILW equation as a reduction of a larger differential-difference system is already seen in the work of Tutiya and Satsuma [12]. Now let us introduce the Lax equation for (7) as follows:
where κ is a purely imaginary constant and ∂ denotes ∂/∂x. Then, the compatibility condition between the evolution in t-direction and that of r-direction becomes
By setting A = −∫Vdx/2, the first equation in (9) becomes U = Ã − A + c, where c is a constant and the second equation becomes nothing but (7). It should be remarked that if one replaces the r-shifts by the x-shifts in Eq. (8), it becomes the Lax equation for the ILW equation reported in the work of Kodama et_al [13]
IV. THETA FUNCTION SOLUTIONS FOR THE AUXILIARY LAX SYSTEM
In this section, theta function solutions of arbitrary genus for Eq. (7) will be presented. The final purpose of this paper is solely to establish a solution of genus two for the ILW equation. But it will give a better perspective to see the solutions for (9) in this wider setting. Enormous effort went towards finding theta function solutions for soliton equations around 1975, thanks to which it is a relatively straightforward exercise these days to find solutions to equations like (8). We shall skip further historical remarks and just list Refs [14–22] as references instead. In this paper, the explanations and notations about this topic basically follows those in Secs. II and III of the textbook [23].
Definition 4. Let X be a compact Riemann surface. We will use the following notations about X:a_{1}, …, a_{g}, b_{1}, …, b_{g} are canonical homology cycles on X.ω_{1}, …, ω_{g} are a set of normalized differentials of the first kind that satisfy ∫_{aj}ω_{k}=2πiδ_{jk}.P_{0} and P_{*} are distinct two points on X.χ_{*} is an abelian differential of the third kind which is holomorphic in X∖{P_{0}, P_{*}} and possesses a pole of degree 1 at P_{*} with the residue +1 and at P_{0} with the residue −1. Moreover, all the a_{j}-periods of χ_{*} vanish.z is a local coordinate around P_{0} which satisfies z(P) = 0.χ_{j}, (j = 1, 2) is a normalized differential of the second kind with a single pole at P_{0} and whose expansion in the neighborhood of P_{0} is (−z^{−j−1} + O(1))dz. χ_{j} is holomorphic in X except for P_{0} and all its a-periods are zero.B is the period matrix and (B){ij}=∫_{bi}ω_{j}.Θ is Riemann’s theta function of genus g defined as
A→ is the Abel-Jacobi map,
The b_{j}-cycles of these differentials will be denoted in vector forms as
Q_{*} and Q_{j}, (j = 1, 2) are defined to satisfy
This setup allows us to introduce a Baker-Akhiezer function in the following form:
where Z→ is a real constant vector chosen to ensure that Θ(A→(P)+Z→) is not identically zero.Ψ(P) is logarithmically ramified at the points P_{*} and P_{0}. We so set the branch cut between P_{*} and P_{0} as not to cross any of a_{j} or b_{j} (j = 1, 2, …, g). Then, with a straightforward calculation, it is noticeable that Ψ(P) is invariant when the point P goes through one full revolution on any cycle of a_{j} or b_{j} (j = 1, 2, …, g). In the vicinity of P_{0}, Ψ(P) is representable as
Hence, (iΨ_{t} − Ψ_{xx})/Ψ and (κΨ̃−Ψ_{x})/Ψ are holomorphic around P_{0}. We also see that Ψ_{t}/Ψ, Ψ_{x}/Ψ, Ψ_{xx}, and Ψ̃/Ψ are also holomorphic around P_{*}, since the r-shift only increases the degree of the zero of Ψ at P_{*}. Hence, (iΨ_{t} − Ψ_{xx})/Ψ and (κΨ̃−Ψ_{x})/Ψ are also holomorphic around P_{*}. Hence, these two functions are meromorphic functions whose g zeros are the same as those of
But such a meromorphic function cannot exist except for constant functions since those g zeros are located at general positions. Hence,
do not depend on P. These are exactly the same as the auxiliary Lax system (8).
Proposition 5. Ψ in (14) is a solution for the Lax system (8), and U and V in (16) are solutions for the compatibility condition (9).
V. THETA FUNCTION SOLUTION FOR ILW OF GENUS 2
Theorem 6. There exist combinations of a Riemann surface X of genus two, a set of homology cycles {a_{1}, a_{2}, b_{1}, b_{2}}, and distinct two points P_{0}, P_{*} which have the following properties:
1. The components of the matrix B are real.
2. U→{1},U→{2}, and U→{*} are purely imaginary vectors.
3. There exists a real nonzero constant γ which satisfies
This is the main theorem of this paper since it will immediately give a theta function solution for the ILW equation (1) with the corollary below.
Corollary 7 (The existence of genus-two solutions for the ILW equation).If we chose X, P_{0}, P_{*}, and homology cycles that make the theorem hold, then u = iU − 2iκ/γ satisfies the ILW equation (1) with λ = 4iκ/γ.
Proof of Corollary 7. Since U does not depend on P and Ψ̃/Ψ|_{P=P*}=0, we set P = P_{*} so that U becomes expressible as
Now, one can readily identify −Fx+/F^{+} as A, −Fx−/F^{−} as Ã, and −κ∫Q_{1}P_{*}χ_{1} as c in formula (7). Suppose κ and Δ are purely imaginary and Z→ is real. Then, F(x, t) is real-valued and has no zero for x,t∈R due to the same argument as in BBEIM, p. 63. Namely, F(x,t)=1+∑_{m1≥0,m2∈Z}⁡exp(m→{t}Bm→)cosh(m→{t}(κxU→{1}−iκ^{2}tU→{2}+Δ^{−1}rU→{*}+Z→))>0. Hence, U is holomorphic in the strip −γ/2κ < Im(x) < γ/2κ if |Im(γ/2κ)| is sufficiently small (or, in other words, |U→{*}| is sufficiently small). By virtue of Lemma 3, U now satisfies
Hence,
satisfies the original ILW equation (1) for the relative depth λ = 4iκ/γ. (The proof of Corollary 7 is finished.)Now let us proceed to prove Theorem 6.
Proof of Theorem 6. We will explicitly construct an example of such a Riemann surface. Let e_{1} < e_{2} < e_{3} < e_{4} < e_{5} be real numbers. Let C be the hyperelliptic curve compactifying an affine curve t^{2}=f(s)=∏j=15(s−e_{j}). Let us set the representatives of the canonical homology cycles as shown in Fig. 2.The following lemma is crucial.
Lemma 8. There exist a pair of real numbers a and c such that a, c > e_{5} and ∫acs−af(s)ds=0. Here, the integration contour starts at (a, f(a)^{1/2}), passes through ∞, and ends at (c, f(c)^{1/2}).
Proof of Lemma 8. Let W be a segment which starts at (a,f(a)), passes through ∞, (e_{5}, 0), and comes back to (a,f(a)) (Fig. 3).
We temporarily distinguish the starting point and the end point and denote them as W_{s} and W_{e}, respectively. Next, we consider Ω:W→R,
where the integration contour starts at W_{s} and lies on W. Suppose Ω(W_{e}) is negative. We notice that Ω is analytic and Ω(W_{s}) = 0. Moreover it becomes locally minimum only at W_{s} and locally maximum at W^{′}{s}≔(a,−f(s)). Hence, there must be a point (c,f(c){1/2})∈W such that Ω((c, f(c)^{1/2})) = 0. If Ω(W_{e}) is positive, we redefine W to be a segment which starts at W_{s}≔(a,−f(a)), passes through (e_{5}, 0), ∞, and comes back to W_{e}=(a,−f(a)). Then, the stationary points again tell us that Ω vanishes at a certain point (c, f(c)^{1/2}). If Ω(W_{e}) is zero, we move a slightly so that it becomes nonzero.
(The proof of Lemma 8 is finished.)
Let us come back to the proof of Theorem 6. We set real numbers a and c so as to make Lemma 8 holds. Then, we introduce a set of abelian differentials of the first kind as
We assume a ≠ b so that ω^{1} and ω^{2} become C-linearly independent. If we introduce a constant matrix Π as
then the normalized differentials of the first kind become
It should be noticed that the period matrix B becomes real in this setting. Moreover, thanks to the reciprocity law for compact Riemann surfaces,
and
become purely imaginary vectors and
holds for certain real constant γ. We notice that ∫acω^{2}≠0 since ω^{1} and ω^{2} are linearly independent. It also should be noticed that ω^{2}|_{a}≠0 because a ≠ b. Hence γ is nonzero. Finally, we have to show that U→{1},U→{2}, and U→{*} are purely imaginary vectors. As for U→{1} and U→{*}, these immediate follow from the expressions (24) and (25). Similarly, the reciprocity law (U→2){j}=(∂_{s}ω_{j}|_{a})/2 also tells us that U→{2} is a purely imaginary.
(The proof of Theorem 6 is finished.)
Proposition 8 (Reality of genus-two solutions).The solution
as in (18) or (20) is real valued if we chose X, {a_{1}, a_{2}, b_{1}, b_{2}}, P_{0}, and P_{*} as those in the proof of Theorem 6 and Corollary 7.
Proof. We already saw that F is a real valued function for real x and t. This implies that −Fx−/F^{−}+Fx+/F^{+} is purely imaginary. Hence, the task left is to show that ∫Q_{1}P_{*}χ_{1} is a real constant. There might be sophisticated ways to see this but we here use an explicit expression of χ_{1} as follows:
α_{j} (j = 1, 2) are real constants chosen so as to eliminate the a-periods of the first term in the r.h.s. This expression tells us that ∫Q_{1}P_{*}χ_{1} is real valued if Q_{1} as well as P_{*} is on W. And Q_{1} does lie on W. Because an integral ∫QPχ_{1}(Q,P∈W) tends to ∞ when Q → W_{s} and to −∞ when Q → W_{e} and is analytic when Q∈W\{W_{s},W_{e}}, there must exist points that agree with the definition of Q_{1}.
VI. NUMERICAL EXAMPLE
A numerical example of a genus-two theta function solution is given in this section. Here, Maple 2016 is used as the calculation software. All of the numbers given are rounded to four decimal places. We do not give these numbers with more accuracy than this since the aim of this section is just to give a tangible image of what we have described in Secs. I–V, not to give precise shapes of 2-solitons. Suppose, for example, e_{j} = j, then the curve C, namely, becomes t^{2} = (s − 1)(s − 2)(s − 3)(s − 4)(s − 5). A numerical approximation of B matrix is
We chose a = 15 and b = 14.9995 for Theorem 6. It should be noticed that we can make |U→{*}| arbitrarily small by setting |a − b| small enough so that the analyticity condition of Corollary 7 holds. Then, the transcendental equation becomes
and a numerical solution indicates c ≈ 6.2152. Then, we obtain
If we set κ = i and Z→=0, the relative depth γ becomes 55.6483 and U is now explicitly written as follows:
A density plot of the solution u for the ILW equation (1) is given in Fig. 4.
VII. FURTHER DISCUSSION
Genus-two solutions for the ILW equation are obtained in this paper. Following the method of this paper, one can obtain solutions of higher genus by finding collinear U→{*} and U→{1}. However, it is probable that this would require another breakthrough in understanding. Another possible future work is to apply this technique to other nonlocal soliton equations such as the intermediate nonlocal nonlinear Schrödinger equation. It should be noticed from the proof of Corollary 7 that the existence of the solution is only ensured for small |Im(γ/κ)|, which corresponds to the Benjamin-Ono limit. To construct a solution around the Korteweg-deVries (KdV) limit is one more challenging problem.
