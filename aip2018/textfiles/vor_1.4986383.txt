(1 + 1) Newton–Hooke group for the simple and damped harmonic oscillator
It is demonstrated that, in the framework of the orbit method, a simple and damped harmonic oscillator is indistinguishable at the level of an abstract Lie algebra. This opens a possibility for treating the dissipative systems within the orbit method. An in-depth analysis of the coadjoint orbits of the (1 + 1) dimensional Newton-Hooke group is presented. Furthermore, it is argued that the physical interpretation is carried by a specific realisation of the Lie algebra of smooth functions on a phase space rather than by an abstract Lie algebra.
I. INTRODUCTION
Sidney Coleman famously said, “The career of a young theoretical physicist consists of treating the harmonic oscillator in ever-increasing levels of abstraction.” The accuracy of this dictum is striking when one considers the abundance of scientific papers devoted to this subject across many branches of physics. It has long been known that in the framework of the orbit method [1–3] the oscillator is described by the Newton–Hooke (NH) group. The NH type groups first appeared in the classification of the possible kinematical groups [4]. The thorough study of the (3 + 1) dimensional NH group was presented in Ref [5]. The orbit method was employed in Ref [6] to study the centrally extended NH group in (2 + 1) dimensions. The coadjoint orbits and the irreducible representations were calculated therein. Besides the orbit method, a planar system with exotic Newton–Hooke symmetry was constructed by the technique of nonlinear realisation [7], and the analysis therein included the chiral decomposition. The idea of chiral decomposition was later applied to the non-commutative Landau problem [8,9] and to the rotation-less NH symmetry of the 3D anisotropic oscillator [10]. Some work on the anisotropic (2 + 1) dimensional NH group was presented in Ref [11]. The extended conformal NH type symmetries were also studied in connection with the Pais–Uhlenbeck oscillator [12–14]. This short overview is far from being complete, but it shows how telling a study of this simple system can be. It is worth mentioning that the orbit method was also successfully used to analyse systems with Galilei and Poincaré type symmetries both in the free case and with external electromagnetic fields [15–25].
In this paper, an accessible yet illuminating example of the harmonic oscillator is examined in the framework of the orbit method [1–3]. In the case of a simple harmonic oscillator, the Lie algebra nh{+} is derived from the standard Hamiltonian description by a technique encouraged by the work of Horváthy et_al [21] Also, the Lie algebra nh{−} differing from nh{+} by a sign of one of the structure constants is discussed.
A detailed analysis of the coadjoint action provides a full understanding of the physical interpretation. Clearly, analysis becomes more involved for the dissipative systems. However, a proper canonical transformation may allow for a significant simplification. For example, the damped harmonic oscillator can be described by nh{+} or nh{−} Lie algebra depending on the extent to which the oscillator is being damped. This simplification comes at a price of using rather elaborate coordinates. Consequently, at the level of the Lie algebra, the damped harmonic oscillator is indistinguishable from the undamped one. This example illustrates a possible way of treating the dissipative systems within the framework of the orbit method. Apparently an abstract Lie algebra does not carry the physical interpretation of the system. The question arises how to use the orbit method so that the physical interpretation is not lost. The current paper is devoted to just this investigation.
This paper is structured as follows. Section II provides a short overview of the orbit method and the computational techniques used in this paper. In Sec. III, starting with the Hamiltonian of the harmonic oscillator, the Lie algebra nh_{+} of the (1 + 1) dimensional Newton–Hooke NH_{+} group is derived to set the scene for further analysis. The name Newton-Hooke group often refers also to another group denoted NH_{−}. Its Lie algebra nh_{−} differs from nh_{+} by the sign of one of the structure constants. The Lie algebra nh_{−} is also considered. Section IV provides the coadjoint action of the group under investigation. Also, the symplectic structure on the coadjoint orbit of NH_{+} and NH_{−} is given. The in-depth analysis of the coadjoint orbits of NH_{+} and NH_{−} is presented in Sec. V. Section VI is devoted to the damped harmonic oscillator and shows that it may be described by the same abstract Lie algebra as the undamped case. The paper closes with conclusions in Sec. VII where also some outlooks are provided.
II. THE ORBIT METHOD
Consider a Lie group G of dimension n and its Lie algebra g generated by {J_{1}, …, J_{n}} with the structure equations
where cijk are the structure constants. For every g ∈ G, the inner automorphism C_{g}: G → G, given by
gives rise to a Lie algebra automorphism (Cg){*e}:g→g. The adjoint representation of Lie group G in its Lie algebra is defined as Ad{g}=(Cg){*e}. In turn, the coadjoint representation of a Lie group G in the space g^{*} dual to g is prescribed by
When dealing with representations in linear spaces one might ask for the matrices of those representations. Recall that the adjoint representation of Lie algebra g, i.e., the infinitesimal version of the adjoint representation of the Lie group G is given by
Furthermore, the infinitesimal version of the coadjoint representation is defined by
Then, the matrix of the adjoint representation of the Lie algebra generator J_{i} is
The matrix mYAd of the adjoint representation of the Lie algebra element Y=∑i=1ny_{i}J_{i} is
In order to find the matrix of the adjoint action MgAd=Me^{y1J1}Ad,…,Me^{ynJn}Ad corresponding to the element g=e^{Y}=e^{y1J1}e^{y2J2},…,e^{ynJn}∈G, it suffices to know all the matrices Me^{yiJi}Ad, i = 1, …, n, which are given by Me^{yiJi}Ad=expy_{i}mJ_{i}ad. Finally, from (1), one easily finds the matrix of the coadjoint representation corresponding to the element g ∈ G to be MgcoAd=Mg^{−1}Ad.
Let us briefly discuss a method of calculating the invariants of coadjoint action [26–30]. A function C∈C^{∞}(g^{*}) is an invariant of the coadjoint action of a Lie group G if ∀_{g∈G}∀_{ξ∈g^{*}}C(coAd{g}(ξ))=C(ξ). Let {x^{1}, …, x^{n}} be coordinates on the space g^{*} dual to g. The infinitesimal generator of the coadjoint representation corresponding to the ith generator is a vector field given, in the coordinates {∂∂x^{1},…,∂∂x^{n}}, by
In Sec. V, we shall study the integral curves of those vector fields for a specific group. A function C∈C^{∞}(g^{*}) is an invariant of the coadjoint representation of a Lie group G if and only if its directional derivative along each of the vector fields (5) vanishes, i.e.,
Clearly, (6) is a set of first-order linear homogeneous partial differential equations (PDE) with variable coefficients.
The knowledge of the invariants of the coadjoint action empowers us to find its orbits. Suppose that there are m < n invariants of the coadjoint action denoted C^{1}, …, C^{m}. Consider a map C:g^{*}→R^{m} given by
At each point ξ′ = coAd_{g}(ξ), g ∈ G of the orbit through ξ, the value of (7) is constant. Moreover, mapping (7) is of a constant and maximal rank; therefore, the preimage of a point is a submanifold in g^{*}. Each of its compact components is precisely a coadjoint orbit through ξ. We shall denote those orbits by O^{C1,…,Cm}. The coadjoint orbits are endowed with a canonical symplectic two-form given pointwise as
where μ∈O^{C1,…,Cm}, X,Y∈g and X_{g^{*}}(μ)≔−coad{X}(μ), Y_{g^{*}}(μ)≔−coad{Y}(μ) are the infinitesimal generators of the coadjoint representation corresponding to X and Y, respectively. This result is known as the Kirillov–Konstant–Souriau theorem. For a smooth function f:O^{C1,…,Cm}→R, the symplectic structure allows us to find its level set. We can do it by the means of the symplectic gradient, i.e., unique vector field X_{f} defined by
pointing in the direction of constant f. This is exactly what the Hamiltonian mechanics is from the geometric perspective.
So far, we have discussed an abstract mathematics behind the orbit method with no connection to physics. There are two questions that should be answered to explain the connection of the orbit method to physics. First, given a Hamiltonian system, can we derive a Lie algebra appropriate for describing this system within the framework of the orbit method? Conversely, given a Lie algebra g, what physical system, if any, does it describe?
Let us start with the first question. One method of constructing such a Lie algebra is based on the Poisson theorem stating that the Poisson bracket of two quantities that are constants of motion is also a constant of motion. This procedure consists in starting with a Poisson algebra of smooth functions on the phase space endowed with a Poisson bracket and then constructing its sub-algebra, having at the disposal integrals and constants of motion including the Hamiltonian and possibly some other functions if necessary. Such a hands-on practical approach will be used in this work to derive the Lie algebra of the Newton-Hooke group. Note that the physical interpretation is clear at every step of the way. There is no ambiguity about the interpretation of the generators. Particularly, one of the generators represents the energy of the system and others are dynamical variables. Then, the constant energy cross section of the coadjoint orbit is the phase trajectory of the system. Thus, at least, the implicit form of solutions to the original problem may be retrieved from the structure of the coadjoint orbit. Of course, the symplectic structure on the coadjoint orbit together with the Hamiltonian yields precisely the set of dynamical equations we have started with.
Now, for the second question, let an n dimensional Lie algebra g be given and {x^{1}, …, x^{n}} denote the coordinates on the space g^{*} dual to g. Let there be m invariants of the coadjoint action, C^{l}, l = 1, …, m. By the implicit function theorem, we can use the invariants of the coadjoint action to, at least locally, express m of the coordinates, e.g., x^{1}, …, x^{m} by n − m other coordinates, e.g., x^{m+1}, …, x^{n}. It is a local parametrisation of the n − m dimensional coadjoint orbit. Assume that we want to use one of those m coordinates, say x^{i}, i ∈ 1, …, m, as a Hamiltonian of the system. The symplectic structure ω on the coadjoint orbit O^{C1,…,Cm} provides us with the dynamical equations
Then x^{i}(x^{m+1}, …, x^{n}) is the Hamiltonian as a function of dynamical variables {x^{m+1}, …, x^{n}} and the evolution of those variables is such that x^{i}(x^{m+1}, …, x^{n}) remains constant. Thus, given a Lie algebra g we may recover the Hamiltonian system from the structure of the coadjoint orbit associated with g. In principle, the dynamical variables {x^{m+1}, …, x^{n}} ought to be measurable for the system to have a physical interpretation. It is enough to be able to express the dynamical variables {x^{m+1}, …, x^{n}} by some other measurable quantities. However, any such information is clearly not encoded in the structure of the Lie algebra g. Therefore, if the starting point for the considerations is an abstract Lie algebra g, the physical interpretation must be provided a posteriori.
III. THE (1 + 1) NEWTON-HOOKE GROUP
Take the Hamiltonian of the simple harmonic oscillator
where p is the kinematic momentum, x is the displacement of the oscillator, and m, ω are positive real numbers interpreted as the mass and angular frequency, respectively. Exploiting the canonical Poisson bracket
one arrives at the well-known equations of motion
or equivalently ẍ = −ω^{2}x.
Let us now employ the technique outlined in Sec. II to derive a Lie algebra suitable for the description of the harmonic oscillator. The Hamiltonian (11), i.e., the total energy of the system is the only integral of motion. This system also admits constants of motion, e.g., f(p,x,t)=t−1ωarctanωkp which at p = 0 has to be understood in the sense of the limit. It is mentioned here only for the sake of completeness; however, it will not be utilised in the present paper because there is no need to consider the time dependent generators. Therefore, h should be included in the set of generators. Inasmuch as some coordinates are needed, one just checks whether p and x could do the job. To this end, calculate the Poisson bracket (12) for all the pairs selected from the set {h, p, x} and find that the non-vanishing brackets are
A quick conclusion is that, in order to have a closed algebra, the set {h, p, x} ought to be augmented by a constant function equal to 1. Even more elegantly, one may replace x with k = mx and use a constant function equal m. In which case, the Hamiltonian (11) becomes
and the Poisson bracket (12), by the chain rule, reads now
The non-vanishing Poisson brackets are
Therefore the set of functions {m, h(p, k), p, k} with the Poisson bracket (16) spans the Poisson sub-algebra of the Poisson algebra of smooth functions of p and k. The above ordering of the basis will be kept throughout this paper. Note that the constant function m is a central generator.
At the abstract level, it is a four-dimensional Lie algebra spanned by the ordered set {M, H, P, K} and characterised by the following nonzero structure constants:
What was described above is known as the Lie algebra of the (1 + 1) dimensional Newton-Hooke group denoted NH_{+}.
The plus sign in NH_{+} is there to distinguish it from another structure commonly associated with the name Newton-Hooke group and denoted NH_{−} [11]. The Lie algebra of NH_{−} is spanned by the ordered set {M, H, P, K} and characterised by the nonzero structure constants
It can be derived, using the method described above, from the following Hamiltonian:
IV. COADJOINT ACTION AND DYNAMICS
Let us begin the analysis with the case of NH_{+}. The matrices of the adjoint action (3) corresponding to the generators M, H, P, and K respectively, are explicitly given by
and mMAd is the zero matrix since m is a central generator. The generic element g of our group can be written as g = (η, τ, l, v) = e^{ηM}e^{τH}e^{lP}e^{vK} ∈ NH_{+}. The coordinates for the dual to our Lie algebra nh+* are realised by m, h, p, and k. The matrix of the coadjoint action of an element g ∈ NH_{+} is then given by MgcoAd=e^{−vmKAd}e^{−lmPAd}e^{−τmHAd}e^{−ηmMAd} which explicitly reads
An element of nh+* is represented as a row vector ξ = [m, h, p, k]. Then the coadjoint action of g ∈ NH_{+} is calculated by matrix multiplication of ξ by MgcoAd on the right, which yields the following explicit form of the coadjoint action:
More detailed analysis of the action (20) will be presented in Sec. V.
The next step is to calculate the invariants of the coadjoint action. In the current case, the set of differential equations (6) can be written in the matrix form as
There are two solutions to (21), namely,
The first one is a trivial consequence of M being a central generator.
Consider a map
At each point ξ^{′} = coAd_{g}(ξ), g ∈ G of the orbit through ξ, the value of (23) is constant. Moreover, mapping (23) is of a constant and maximal rank, therefore the preimage of a point is a submanifold in nh+{*}. Each of its compact components is precisely a coadjoint orbit through ξ. In the present case, the orbit, denoted O+C+1,C+2, admits a single global parametrisation
so, in principle, it might be covered by a single map, e.g., φ+−1. Note that, in the this example, the Hamiltonian
which was derived from the invariants of the coadjoint action is, up to an additive constant, equivalent to the initial Hamiltonian (15). We quickly infer that C+2 is the manifestation of the fact that we have the freedom of shifting the potential energy by a constant. For the sake of completeness, note that the Jacobian of the map (m,h,p,k)↦C+1,C+2,p,k is −2mω^{2}≠0 since m > 0. The Poisson tensor Λ_{+} on the orbit O+C+1,C+2 written in the chart (O+C+1,C+2,φ+−1) reads
which is equivalent to (16). Since m ≠ 0 on the orbit O+C+1,C+2, the Poisson structure is non-degenerate, and one quickly finds [31] that the corresponding symplectic two-form is
Therefore, employing the Hamiltonian (25), one finds the equations of motion to be
which, when combined with k = mx, are equivalent to (13). Thus, we have recovered the original problem from the structure of the coadjoint orbit.
Let us now proceed with the analysis of NH_{−}. By repeating the procedure used before, we find that the explicit form of the coadjoint action a group element g = (η, τ, l, v) = e^{ηM}e^{τH}e^{lP}e^{vK} ∈ NH_{−} on ξ=[m,h,p,k]∈nh{−} is
The invariants of the coadjoint action of NH_{−} are
Again, C−1 is a trivial consequence of m being a central generator. Consider a map
The value of (31) is constant at each point ξ′ = coAd_{g}(ξ), g ∈ NH_{−} of the orbit through ξ. Farther, mapping (31) is of a constant and maximal rank; therefore, the preimage of a point is a submanifold in nh−*. Each of its compact components is precisely a coadjoint orbit through ξ. The orbit, denoted O−C−1,C−2, admits a single global parametrisation
The Hamiltonian
which was derived from the invariants of the coadjoint action is, up to an additive constant, equivalent to the initial Hamiltonian (18). Again C−2 is responsible for constant shifts of potential energy. The orbit O−C−1,C−2 might be covered by a single map, e.g., φ−−1. Let us mention that the Jacobian of the map (m,h,p,k)↦C−1,C−2,p,k is 2mω^{2}≠0 since m > 0. The Poisson tensor Λ_{−} on the orbit O−C−1,C−2 written in the chart (O−C−1,C−2,φ−−1) reads
Since m ≠ 0, the Poisson structure is non-degenerate. We quickly find that the corresponding symplectic two-form is
Finally, the equations of motion are
V. COADJOINT ORBITS OF NH_{+} AND NH_{−}
Further insight into the structure of the coadjoint orbit of NH_{+} can be gained by examining, one by one, the coadjoint actions of the group elements that correspond to the generators. They are the integral curves of the vector fields (5). The general solution of (28) is
Let us consider a test solution of (28), for example,
that is, at t = 0 the displacement is maximal and momentum is zero. The energy is constant and at any time is given by (25) (E=h̃{+}(p,k)); furthermore, m=C+1 is also fixed. The trajectory of the system, as time flies, is then given by
The trajectory (37) lies on the coadjoint orbit characterised by C+1=m and a fixed C+2.
The coadjoint action of a group element g = exp(τH) generated by H on (37) is
that is to say, m and E remain constant and p, k follow the elliptic trajectory. Clearly, H generates temporal shifts. Moreover as the system evolves, it stays on the same orbit.
In fact, we need not start with the explicit solution of the equations of motion. It suffices to begin with a point
where the parametrisation φ_{+}:R^{2}→O+C+1,C+2 is provided by (24). The coadjoint action of a group element g = exp(τH) on (39) is
Then, functions (40c) and (40d) are solutions to the set of differential equations of the form (28) with the initial conditions p′(τ = 0) = p_{0} and k′(τ = 0) = k_{0}. Thus, the coadjoint orbit method empowers us to find the solutions to the original problem.
Next, let us consider a group element g = exp(lP) generated by P. Its coadjoint action on (37) is
The displacement (x=km) is increased by l and the energy is changed exactly in such a way that the system stays on the same orbit which means that P generates spatial shifts of the initial conditions.
Finally, a group element g = exp(vK) generated by K acts on (37) by
i.e., m and k are constant, momentum p is decreased by mv, and the energy is adjusted so that the system remains on the orbit. Clearly, K generates the momentum shifts. For the sake of completeness, it is worth mentioning that the action of group elements generated by M is identity. The examples of above-described actions are presented in Fig. 1(a) which also, by a small leap of imagination, allows us to visualise the coadjoint orbit. Figure 1(b) depicts two constant energy cross sections of the coadjoint orbit, i.e., the phase trajectories of the simple harmonic oscillator.
Let us now examine the coadjoint orbit of NH_{−}. Consider a test solution of (36), for example,
i.e., a general solution with phase factor chosen to be zero.
The energy is constant and at any time is given by (33) (E=h̃{−}(p,k)), and m=C−1 is fixed. The trajectory, as system evolves with time, is then given by
The trajectory (43) lies on the coadjoint orbit characterised by C−1=m and a fixed C−2.
The coadjoint action of a group element g = exp(τH) generated by H on (43) is
that is to say, m and E remain constant and p, k follow the phase trajectory. Clearly, H generates time evolution. Moreover as the system evolves, it stays on the same orbit.
Next, let us consider a group element g = exp(lP) generated by P. Its coadjoint action on (43) is
The displacement (x=km) is increased by l and the energy is changed exactly in such a way that the system stays on the same orbit which means that P generates spatial shifts of the initial conditions.
Finally, a group element g = exp(vK) generated by K acts on (43) as
i.e., m and k are constant, momentum p is decreased by mv, and the energy is adjusted so that the system remains on the orbit. Clearly, K generates the momentum shifts. Let us add that the action of group elements generated by M is identity. Figure 2(a) depicts a coadjoint orbit O^{C−1,C−2} with C−2=0. The constant energy cross section of the orbit O^{C−1,C−2}, i.e., possible phase trajectories of the system, are shown in Fig. 2(b).
VI. DAMPED HARMONIC OSCILLATOR
A slightly more complex system which can be investigated by similar techniques is a damped harmonic oscillator. Take the following time dependent Hamiltonian:
where 2γ=βm with β > 0 being the friction coefficient and ω_{0} is the undamped frequency of the oscillator. Note that P=mẋe^{2γt}, i.e., the canonical momentum does not coincide with the kinetic momentum p = mẋ. The Hamiltonian (47) with the canonical Poisson bracket yields the following equations of motion:
or equivalently ẍ+2γẋ+ω02x=0. It is an easy exercise to check that the procedure that was carried out in Sec. III for the undamped oscillator fails in the present case. Indeed, introducing the new coordinate k = mx, one finds that the Hamiltonian (47) becomes
and, by the chain rule, the new Poisson bracket is just (16). Then, one quickly finds that
which fails to constitute a Lie algebra because there is an undesired time dependency of the structure constants. One way to deal with this problem is to use a generating function method to bring the Hamiltonian (47) to a more convenient form [32,33].
Consider the following generating function of the second kind:
The transformation rules for the coordinates are
Furthermore, the old h and the new H Hamiltonians obey
The relations between old (P,x) and new (P, Q) coordinates can be written as
By the chain rule, ∂∂P=∂P∂P∂∂P+∂Q∂P∂∂Q=e^{−γt}∂∂P and ∂∂x=∂P∂x∂∂P+∂Q∂x∂∂Q=mγe^{γt}∂∂P+e^{γt}∂∂Q, so one quickly finds that the Poisson bracket (12) becomes
i.e., the transformation (53) is canonical but, since H ≠ h, it is not a symmetry. Finally, the transformed Hamiltonian takes the following form:
If ω_{0} > γ, then the Hamiltonian (56) is functionally equivalent to (11) with ω^{2}=ω02−γ^{2}. If however ω_{0} < γ, then the Hamiltonian (56) is functionally equivalent to (18) with ω^{2}=ω02−γ^{2}. Therefore, in the new coordinates P and Q, the procedure of constructing the Lie algebra as in Sec. III can be carried out. The resulting algebra would be nh_{±} depending on the sign of ω02−γ^{2}. Consequently, at the level of the abstract Lie algebra, those systems are indistinguishable. The difference lies in the realisation of the generators as smooth functions of the phase space coordinates. It is important to stress that the Hamiltonian derived from the invariants of the coadjoint action would be functionally equivalent, up to an additive constant, to (56) not to the initial Hamiltonian (47) as the interpretation of the coordinates has changed.
VII. CONCLUDING REMARKS
It was shown that, in the framework of the orbit method, a simple and damped harmonic oscillator can be described by the same abstract Lie algebra. The simple, yet striking example presented here shows that, when the dynamics on the coadjoint orbits are considered, a mere knowledge of an abstract Lie algebra does not suffice to provide the physical interpretation. What describes the system is rather a specific realisation of the Lie algebra in terms of the smooth functions on the classical phase space.
Particularly, the result presented in the current paper stresses the importance of keeping track of the physical interpretation when using the orbit method, which might be crucial when the deformation quantisation on the coadjoint orbit is considered [34–40]. One way to achieve that is to derive a relevant Lie algebra starting from the Hamiltonian formulation as was done in the current paper for the harmonic oscillator or in Ref [21] for an extended Galilei group also known in the literature as the Galilei-Maxwell group [24]. It is the intention of the author to follow with the application of the current results in the case of the Poincaré-Maxwell group soon.
