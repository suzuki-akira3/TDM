Effects on performance of a 90° optical hybrid due to rotation of a 45° reflector scanner in a free space optical communication terminal
The effects on the performance of a 90° optical hybrid due to rotation of a 45° reflector scanner in a free space optical communication terminal were analyzed. A geometrical model of the 45° reflector was first established. Its polarization transmission characteristics were analyzed by three-dimensional polarization calculus, and the effect on the response of the 90° optical hybrid was analyzed. The relationship between the scanning angle in the pitching and azimuth directions and the effects on the beam ratio and phase shift were simulated for both a polarization-maintaining film and Ag. The results showed that the performance of the 90° optical hybrid was hardly affected during scanning of 45 ± 12° in the pitching direction for both the polarization-maintaining film and Ag, but the phase shift of the 90° optical hybrid changed markedly during scanning from −12° to 12° in the azimuth direction, especially for Ag. These results may be useful in the design of coherent laser communication systems.
I. INTRODUCTION
With advantages of wider bandwidth, larger capacity, a more compact terminal, lower power consumption, greater security against eavesdropping, immunity from interference, and no regulatory restrictions on use of frequencies or bandwidths, free space laser communication has gradually become an important method in recent years to realize long-distance, high-rate space laser communication. Compared with traditional intensity modulation/direct detection, coherent detection has higher detection sensitivity and higher data rates and has become the main method of next-generation space laser communication. Germany successfully conducted coherent laser communication experiments between two low earth orbit (LEO) satellites for the first time in 2008; the communication rate was as high as 5.625 Gbps, marking the beginning of coherent laser communication space applications [1,2]. The European data relay system also adopted a homodyne coherent detection system, and the first commercial laser communication geosynchronous orbit (GEO) satellite was launched on January 30, 2016, the first space data highway laser node.
Space coherent optical communication, as the most important branch of space optical communication technology, is the main technical way to break the limit of mass data wireless communication transmission, and optical hybrid is a core device which can be used for improving the detection sensitivity of the system through the optical frequency mixing of signal beam and local oscillation beam. In coherent free space laser communication systems, the polarization of the signal laser should be the same as that of the local laser so as to achieve as high a mixing efficiency as possible [3]. The polarization of the local laser can be controlled stably, and signal light polarization is hardly affected by the atmospheric channel when using circular polarization, as demonstrated by Toyoshima [4]. However, the polarization of the signal will be affected by the rotation of the scanning mirror in the space laser communication terminal. This problem can be solved if a polarization-maintaining film is coated on the scanning mirror because the incident angle of the signal into the scanner mirror is always 45° in the laser communication terminal with a periscopic scanner or coude optical path. The polarization of the signal light will be unchanged during the scanning process. However, for a terminal with a 45° reflector scanning mechanism, the incident angle changes during the scanning process. Then, the polarization of the signal will change even if a polarization-maintaining film is coated on the scanning mirror because the polarization-maintaining film can only work at a specific angle. Thus, the signal does not always enter the 90° optical hybrid at 45° linear-polarized, resulting in decreased system performance.
Many studies have examined the polarization transmissive characteristic of optical instruments with an optical scanner. Yang studied the polarization properties of a two-axis periscope optical system represented by a pair of rotating planar mirrors using a three-dimensional polarization ray-tracing matrix method [5]. Garrison provided a theoretical description of the polarization characteristics of an altazimuth SkyScanner, based on Mueller–Stokes calculus, and confirmed the theoretical results by experiments [6]. Anzolin studied the optical properties of a two-axis galvanometric optical scanner with a pair of rotating planar mirrors and analyzed the transformation induced in the polarization state of the input beam [7]. In a previous paper, we proposed a real-time polarization compensation method based on rotating waveplates to solve the problem of low mixing efficiency caused by unstable signal polarization because of the moving mirror in a laser communication terminal with a periscopic scanner [8]. Moreover, several papers have reported signal polarization changes caused by the relative motion of the scanning mirror, and a real-time polarization compensation method for the received signal has been proposed. However, a real-time polarization control loop is complex in practice, so whether a real-time polarization control is really needed in a coherent free space laser communication terminal with a 45° reflector scanner is an issue. A mirror coated with a polarization-maintaining film will usually be deformed because of the stress in the film, but a mirror coated with a metal film will avoid this problem. Could a mirror coated with Ag satisfy the requirements of a coherent laser communication system?
In this study, the effects on the performance of a 90° optical hybrid due to rotation of a 45° reflector coated with polarization-maintaining film and Ag in a free space optical communication terminal were analyzed. The relationship between the rotation angle of the reflector in the pitching direction and the beam ratio and phase shift of a 90° optical hybrid was assessed. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces the optical model of the coherent detector optical terminal with a 45° reflector and a 90° optical hybrid, Sec. III presents the simulation and analysis results, and Sec. IV provides our concluding remarks.
II. MODEL OF AN OPTICAL TERMINAL WITH A 45° REFLECTOR SCANNER
The laser communication terminal with a 45° reflector scanner included a scanning mechanism, a telescopic unit, and the subsequent light path unit. In a previous study [9], we found that the influence of signal polarization caused by the telescopic unit and the subsequent light path was constant; it can be compensated for readily in the optical assembly process. However, signal polarization changes caused by the scanning mirror are related to the terminal scanning angle, in both the azimuth and the pitching directions, which may result in decreased system performance. Thus, in this study, we only considered polarization changes caused by the scanning mirror, ignoring the other optical components, in a space laser communication terminal.
Unlike a free space laser communication terminal with a periscopic scanner or coude optical path, the scanning angle range of a terminal with the 45° reflector scanner for GEO is smaller, about 20°, but it is large enough for a GEO terminal to cover ground terminals or LEO terminals. To reduce polarization change caused by the 45° reflector during the scanning process, polarization-maintaining film was coated on the scanning mirror, but the film only worked optimally at 45°. A polarization control loop in this terminal was not desirable. Thus, we used a quarter waveplate to change elliptically polarized light into linear-polarized light, and a λ/2 waveplate to change linear-polarized light to 45°. Both were optimally adjusted at a 45° scanning angle. A schematic view of the laser communication terminal with a 45° reflector scanner is shown in Fig. 1.
As shown in Fig. 1, suppose the incoming signal is left-circular-polarized. After being reflected by the reflector scanner, the output signal polarization will change during the scanning process. Based on the amplitude reflection coefficients for the polarization-maintaining film and Ag, the output signal polarization will be calculated and its effects on 90° optical hybrid performance will be analyzed.
A. Polarization transmission characteristics of the 45° reflector
In this section, a geometric model of the 45° scanning mirror was first established. Then, its polarization transmission characteristics were analyzed by three-dimensional polarization calculus, and the system polarization transmission matrix was calculated. A geometric model of the scanning mirror is shown in Fig. 2.
M is the reflecting mirror, (x, y, z) refers to the system global coordinates, whereas (w, u, v) is the system local coordinates. β is the incident angle of the input signal, which will be changed during the scanning process. The mirror scanning angle is calculated from its zero point. The surface-normal direction of M in the system global coordinates is 0,22,−22 at the zero point, which is defined as perpendicular to the mirror and points in the beam-transmitting direction. The corresponding azimuth angle α=0^{∘}, and the pitching angle β=45^{∘}.
The direction vector of the output beam is related to the azimuth angle α and the pitching angle β. To analyze the effect of the 45° mirror on performance more simply, we first assume that the azimuth angle is constant and always at the zero point. The relationship between the pitching angle β and the performance of the 90° hybrid will be established in the early part of this paper. Then, the effect caused by scanning in the azimuth direction will be analyzed later. Thus, the normal direction of the surface of M is related only to the pitching angle β in this section
According to Ref [10], for a mirror the normal of which has components [n_{x},n_{y},n_{z}], its reflection matrix is generally described by H
Based on formulae (1) and (2), the reflection matrix H can be calculated. Then, the relationship between the output beam direction k_{out} and the input beam direction k_{in} can be determined
As shown in Fig. 1, the incident beam direction is k_{in}=[0,1,0], and the output beam direction after being reflected by M is k_{out}.
According to the three-dimensional polarization calculus proposed by Yun [11,12], the total polarization change in the optical system is treated as the sum of the polarization effects caused by all refractive and reflective surfaces. Thus, the polarization ray-tracing matrix P is the sum of the matrices of all the optical interfaces, and the polarization calculus is described in terms of global coordinates. Based on this calculus, the polarization metrics of the 45° mirror can be expressed as
For the quarter waveplate fast axis, corresponding to the x-axis of the global coordinate system, when it rotates around the z-axis to angle θ, its polarization transmission matrix is
For the λ/2 waveplate fast axis, corresponding to the x-axis of the global coordinate system, when it rotates around the z-axis to angle γ, its polarization transmission matrix is
The polarization of the output beam passing through the scanning mirror and compensating waveplates is E_{out}, which is the product of P_{total}, P_{λ/4}, and P_{λ/2}, that is
Assume that the incident signal has left-circular polarization. Based on the formula above, the output beam polarization can be calculated readily by adding the scanning angle β into the formula.
The output beam polarization, E_{out}, is calculated in terms of global coordinates, but polarization is usually described by the Jones matrix in local coordinates, so the formula above should be changed to
Here, M_{total}=Qtotal−1 P_{total}, where Q_{total} is the matrix that provides the defined relationship between local coordinates in the incident and output planes, while Qtotal−1 reverses the geometric transformation so that the coordinate system in the exit space reverts back to the initial local coordinate system. For more details, see Ref [12]. The output beam polarization, E_{out}, can then be calculated in local coordinates.
B. Optical principle of a 90° optical hybrid
Coherent homodyne optical communication in which the sensitivity can reach the quantum limit needs the phase of signal light and local oscillator light locked. Compared to the balanced loop, decision-driven loop, syncbit loop, dither loop, etc., the costas loop has lower laser linewidth requirements and mature technology; as a result, the costas loop, which is easier to implement, is applied in the phase-locked control of signal light and local oscillator light. A 2 × 4-port 90° optical hybrid is one of the key components of optical costas phase-locked loop. Comparing with other optical hybrid schemes, the 2 × 4-port 90° optical hybrid has the best overall performance in the phase noise suppression. So, we focus on the theoretical research on this scheme. As suggested by Garreis [13], 2 × 4-port 90° with a polarizing beam splitter has better performance than optical hybrid with nonpolarizing beam splitter; its optical principle is shown in Fig. 3.
The mixer mixes the incoming beam E_{S} and E_{LO} such that interference signals from the output ports are phase shifted by 0°, 180°, 90°, and 270° relatively to each other. The dc parts of the 0°, 180°, 90°, and 270° channels are equal such that by subtracting their detector signals, one ends up with two pure interference signals phase shifted by 90° and with relative intensities K_{2}K_{3}/K_{1}K_{4}; the optical schematic of 2 × 4-port 90° with a polarizing beam splitter is shown in Fig. 4.
The signal and local oscillator beams of the same wavelength enter the mixer linearly polarized. A quarter waveplates (1) render the local oscillator beam to a circular polarization. At the polarizing beam splitter, (2) the two beams are combined. It combines the polarization components of the signal and local oscillator beams which are perpendicular to each other. This combination introduces a relative phase shift of 90° between the interference terms of the two output beams. Then, the output beams are rotated to 45° by half waveplates (3). After the rotation, the polarization beam splitters (4) split the beams such that interference patterns shifted by 180° can be formed.
The incoming signal beam is given by
where E_{S}(x,y,z)=E_{S}(x,y)exp⁡i(kz−ωt) with the local coordinate system (x, y, z), k_{1} is the polarization component parallel to the propagation plane, k_{2} is the perpendicular polarization component, k12+k22=1, and ϕ(t) represents the phase modulation of the signal.
The local oscillator beam is
The quarter waveplate with its fast axis along the direction of the parallel polarization is described by the matrix
It introduces a π/2 phase shift between the components of the local oscillator beam by
The reflection and transmission matrices for the polarization beam splitter are
The beams leaving the combiner are then described by
For a perfect polarizing beam splitter, r_{⊥}=t_{∥}=1.
Afterwards the beams pass half waveplates (3). They are positioned such that their fast axes are rotated by α = −22.5° with respect to the beam plane. Their action is described by the matrix
After being rotated by this matrix, the beams ΛE_{1} and ΛE_{2} pass the polarization beam splitters (4). In an ideal case, the intensities at the four output ports are
with ψ=ρ_{⊥}−τ_{∥}−π/4, the subtracted signals are
In costas phase-locked loop, the above two subtracted signals are routed to the in-phase arm (I-arm) and the quadrature-phase arm (Q-arm), the signals from both arms are multiplied in the electrical mixer after amplification, and the output of the mixer controls the frequency of the local oscillator laser via the loop filter. Usually the two signals are unequal power splitting; the power splitting ratio is defined as
while the phase shift of the two arms is
The phase shift deviations from 90° can be compensated for by rotating the quarter waveplate. However, these results were determined under conditions where the incoming signal was linear-polarized. If the incoming signal is not linear-polarized, the polarization component parallel to the propagation K_{1} and the perpendicular polarization component K_{2} will change. Moreover, the power splitting ratio of the two arms will also change. At the same time, there will be a phase shift error Δϕ between the two output signals, so that the phase shift is changed with the scanning angle of the 45° reflector because there is no polarization control loop in the terminal, and it cannot be compensated for by rotating the quarter waveplate completely during the scanning process. Then, the phase shift of the two arms is
The above two parameters are very important for an optical homodyne receiver comprising a costas loop. It has been pointed out [14] that the signal power splitting ratio is related to the laser linewidth, bit rate, and required bit error rate (BER); the required input power to achieve a given BER can be minimized with an optimum power splitting ratio, while the phase shift error between two arms must not exceed a certain value in order to provide reliable local oscillator synchronization.
III. SIMULATION AND ANALYSIS RESULTS
A. Polarization changes with the rotation angle
In this section, first the polarization transmission properties of the free space laser communication terminal with a 45° reflector scanner were analyzed. Then, the relationships between scan angle, polarization ray-tracing metrics, and output signal polarization were determined, assuming that the operating wavelength of the laser communication system is 1550 nm and the scanning range is 24° in both the pitching and azimuth directions. The incident angle of signal rays at the scanning mirror was between 33° and 57° in the pitching direction. To investigate the effect on the performance of the 90° optical hybrid due to rotation of a 45° reflector more comprehensively, both the polarization properties of the reflector coated with polarization-maintaining film and Ag were analyzed. The schematic diagram of the polarization-maintaining film is shown below.
As shown in Fig. 5, the substrate glass is Zerodur, and the polarization-maintaining film is composed of multilayer high and low refractive index coating materials; the high refractive index coating material is TiO_{2}, low refractive index coating material is SiO_{2}, the total thickness of the film is 7.03 μm, and the number of layers is 38. This is thicker than the Ag film (about 1.08 μm). The thicker the film is, the bigger the film stress; the mirror surface shape deformed from 0.015λ to 0.147λ (root mean square of mirror surface shape error) with polarization-maintaining film, while the mirror surface shape deformed from 0.015λ to 0.02λ with silver.
The complex amplitude reflection coefficients for polarization-maintaining film at 1550 nm between 33° and 57° are listed in Table I, while those for Ag are in Table II (r_{p} and r_{s} are the Fresnel reflection coefficients for p- and s-polarized light, respectively).
As shown in Eqs. (1)–(9), the output beam polarization is related to the scanning angle β. To evaluate the polarization compensation characteristics of the system, we performed polarization ray tracings with five groups of scanning angles. The incident beam was left-hand-circular-polarized, and its three-dimensional Jones matrix is E_{in} = [0.707, 0.707i, 0], by substitution in Eq. (9). The polarization ray-tracing matrices and output beam polarization were calculated (Table III).
In Table III, the second and third rows represent the three-dimensional Jones matrix of the output beam reflected by the reflector scanner for the polarization-maintaining film and Ag. The fourth and fifth rows represent the ellipse and orientation angle of the output beam. Here, ε is the magnitude of the ratio of the axis of the ellipse, and φ is the orientation of the major axis. As shown in Table III, because of the limitations of the polarization-maintaining film and the Ag film, the output beam is changed from circular-polarized light to elliptically polarized light. Moreover, the ellipticity and the orientation of the major axis of the output beam change with the scanning angle. To change the output beam from linear-polarized light to 45°, a quarter waveplate was used to change the elliptically polarized light into linear-polarized light, and then a λ/2 waveplate changed the linear-polarized light to 45°. Both were optimally adjusted at 45°. The corresponding rotation angle θ of the λ/4 waveplate is 42.1446°, and the rotation angle γ of the λ/2 waveplate is 66.2156° for the polarization-maintaining film. The corresponding rotation angle θ of the λ/4 waveplate is 43.9318°, and the rotation angle γ of the λ/2 waveplate is 64.9837° for Ag.
When the mirror is rotated in the pitching direction, the polarization of the output beam cannot be stable at 45°. Both the ellipticity and the orientation of the output beam will change during the scanning process, and the numerical simulation of these processes is shown in Fig. 6.
In Fig. 6, the subgraphs (1a)–(5a) represent the output beam polarization after passing through the scanning mirror. Subgraphs (1b)–(5b) represent the output beam polarization after passing through the quarter waveplate and λ/2 waveplate. For the reflector scanner coated with polarization-maintaining film represented by the blue line in Fig. 5, the output beam after passing through a scanner mirror is almost circular-polarized. This indicated that the polarization-maintaining film worked well. Moreover, the polarization of the output beam passing through the quarter waveplate and λ/2 waveplate differs in the five groups of pitching angle; the corresponding ellipticity ε is 0.000276, 0.000595, 0, 0.0041, and 0.0045, respectively. The orientation angle φ is 45.0154°, 45.734°, 45°, 44.6055°, and 44.4161°, respectively. For the reflector scanner coated with Ag represented by the red line in Fig. 5, the output beam after passing through the scanner mirror is changed more obviously than with the polarization-maintaining film. The ellipticity changed from 0.9368 to 0.7872, but its orientation angle was constant, and for polarization of the output beam passing through the quarter waveplate and λ/2 waveplate in five groups of pitching angle, the corresponding ellipticity ε was 0.00031, 0.000471, 0, 0.000834, and 0.0012, and the orientation angle φ was 42.9059°, 43.7326°, 45°, 46.0925°, and 47.8262°, respectively. From the results shown, we can conclude that the output beam is nearly linear-polarized and the orientation angle is ∼45° for both the polarization-maintaining and Ag films in the pitching direction; the difference between them is very small.
B. Effects on the performance of the 90° optical hybrid
In this section, the effects on the performance of the 90° optical hybrid due to rotation of the 45° reflector in pitching direction were analyzed. Then, the azimuth direction was analyzed.
As shown in the later part of Sec. II, the two major parameters of the 90° optical hybrid are the beam ratio η and the phase shift φ. Both are related to the polarization of the incoming signal. Suppose the incoming signal is linear-polarized at 45°, the beam ratio is η = 1 and the phase shift is φ = 90°. The polarization of the output beam changes with the scanning angle in the pitching direction, as listed in Table III, so the relationship between the pitching angle, the beam ratio η, and the phase shift φ can be determined. The results are shown in Figs. 7 and 8 (P-M indicates the polarization-maintaining film).
As shown in Figs. 7 and 8, the beam ratio η changes between 0.93 and 1.1 for Ag and 0.97 and 1.03 for the polarization-maintaining film during the scanning process in the pitching direction. The phase shift θ changes between 90.14° and 88.96° for the polarization-maintaining film and 90° and 89.73° for Ag. We can conclude that although the Ag film could not maintain the signal polarization during reflector scanning in the pitching direction, its effect on the performance of the 90° hybrid was almost the same as that of the polarization-maintaining film; the reason for this is that the orientation angle of the output beam passing through the scanner mirror coated with Ag is constant.
However, the situation is quite different with regard to scanning in the azimuth direction. The signal polarization of the output beam passing through the reflector mirror will change during the scanning process, but only the orientation angle changes, not the ellipticity, because the incident angle of the signal beam is unchanged during scanning in the azimuth direction, and the ellipticity of the output beam is related only to the incident angle. However, the orientation will change because the λ/4 and λ/2 waveplates are fixed. Suppose the reflector scanning is from −12° to 12° in the azimuth direction. For the fixed λ/4 waveplate, the orientation angle of the output beam no longer accords with the fast axis of the λ/4 waveplate, but swings around by 42.1446° for the polarization-maintaining film and 43.9318° for the Ag film. To analyze the effects caused by scanning in the azimuth direction more simply, we suppose the orientation angle of the output beam is constant, but the fast axis of the λ/4 waveplate can be rotated between 42.1446 ± 12° (polarization-maintaining film) and 43.9318 ± 12° (Ag film), and the λ/2 waveplate rotates with the λ/4 waveplate, so their relative position is unchanged. Then, by substituting the output beam polarization matrix and rotation angle of the λ/4 waveplate and the λ/2 waveplate into Eq. (9), the output beam polarization matrix can be determined, so that the effects on the 90° optical hybrid can be analyzed. The results are shown in Figs. 9 and 10 (P-M indicates the polarization-maintaining film).
As shown in Fig. 9, the beam ratio η changes during the scanning process in the azimuth direction for both the polarization-maintaining and Ag films. The trend and span of the changes are almost the same, but the difference between different pitching angles for Ag is bigger than for the polarization-maintaining film. From Fig. 10, we can conclude that the reflector coated with Ag has more effect on the phase shift than the polarization-maintaining film, and the bigger the pitching angle, the bigger the phase shift span during scanning in the azimuth direction. For the polarization-maintaining film, the phase shift changes from 87.4° to 90.5° during the scanning process in the azimuth direction for all five groups of pitching angle, which is small enough to satisfy the requirements of a coherent free space laser communication system.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
We sought to analyze the effects on the performance of a 90° optical hybrid due to rotation of a 45° reflector scanner in a free space optical communication terminal. A geometric model of the laser communication terminal was first established; its polarization transmission characteristics were analyzed by three-dimensional polarization calculus, and the optical principle of the 90° optical hybrid was analyzed. The relationship between the scan angle in the pitching and azimuth directions and the effects on the beam ratio and phase shift were simulated for a polarization-maintaining and a Ag film. The results showed that the performance of the 90° optical hybrid was hardly affected during scanning in the pitching direction for either film, but was changed markedly during scanning in the azimuth direction, especially for Ag. Thus, the designed polarization-maintaining film is preferred in the free space laser communication terminal. These findings will be useful in the design of coherent laser communication systems.
APPENDIX A
In this section, 3D Jones vector/matrix formalism is presented.
Different form traditional Jones vector only describes the electric field and the polarization ellipse with respect to a local coordinate system associated with the particular transverse plane. Additional constraint involving operation on the propagation vector is added to the three-dimensional polarization matrix definition, so as to describe the electric field and the polarization ellipse with respect to a global coordinate system (Fig. 11).
Polarization ray-tracing matrix Pq characterizes the change in the three-element electric field vector at each interface q; the propagation vectors k^{q−1} and k^{q} may be different due to reflection or retraction. E_{q−1} and E_{q} before and after the interaction are related by the polarization ray-tracing matrix for the qth intercept
P_{q} is associated with specific incident and exiting propagation vectors, k^{q−1} and k^{q}.
A ray interacting with a series of optical elements is represented by cascading the P_{q} matrices for each ray intercept, yielding a net polarization ray-tracing matrix P_{total} that represents the entire ray path
For reflection and refraction from surfaces, the s- and p-polarization stated along with the propagation vector form a natural basis; the {s^,p^,k^} basis the surface local coordinates {s^{q},p^{q},k^{q−1}} before and {s^q′,p^q′,k^{q}} after the q_{th} surface are
The polarization ray-tracing matrix for refraction or reflection is

Oin,q−1 operates on E_{q−1} in global coordinates and calculates the {s^{q},p^{q},k^{q−1}} basis components for the incident light projection onto the incident local coordinates. O_{out,q} rotates the surface local vectors {s^q′,p^q′,k^{q}} back to the global coordinates.
And the matrix J_{q} is the three-dimensional Jones matrix and is given by
r_{s,q} and r_{ p,q} are the Fresnel reflection coefficients for s- and p-polarized light, respectively.
APPENDIX B
In this section, the transformation matrix Q_{total} is presented.
The cumulative parallel transport ray-tracing matrix for a ray through a system with N interfaces is
Q_{total} provides a well-defined relationship between local coordinates in the incident and exiting transverse planes. Qtotal−1 reverses the geometric transformation so that the coordinate system in exit space is reverted back to the initial coordinate system. The operation
M_{total} is a polarization ray-tracing matrix with the exiting electric field vectors rotated about k^{0}×k^{N} and/or reflected in the surface, so the incident and exiting transverse planes are parallel, and both are orthogonal to k^{0}.
Q_{q} for reflection is

APPENDIX C
In this section, the derivation of the reflection matrix is presented.
At an interface between two homogeneous and isotropic media, described by indices n and n′, the incidence angle I and the outgoing angle I′ are related by Snell's law
Another way of Snell's law can be expressed as
where r=(k_{x},k_{y},k_{z}) is the unit vector of initial ray direction, r^{′}=(kx′,ky′,kz′) is the unit vector of ray direction after refraction or reflection, and s=[n_{x},n_{y},n_{z}] is the surface-normal direction of incident ray intersect.
Taking the cross product of both sides with s gives another form
The reflection equations can be derived from those of refraction by setting the index of the final medium equal to the negative of that of the incident medium, n′ = −n. The incident and reflected ray directions are related by
Another expression is
This relationship can be written in terms of dyadic as
This is equivalent to the matrix form
The matrix associated with a sequence of reflection from plane surfaces is calculated by multiplying the matrices for each reflection.
