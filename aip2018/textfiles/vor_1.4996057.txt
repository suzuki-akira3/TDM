Critical current measurements of high-temperature superconducting short samples at a wide range of temperatures and magnetic fields
High-Temperature Superconductors (HTS) are potential materials for high-field magnets, low-loss transmission cables, and Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES) due to their high upper critical magnetic field (H_{c2}) and critical temperature (T_{c}). The critical current (I_{c}) of HTS, which is one of the most important parameters for superconductor application, depends strongly on the magnetic fields and temperatures. A new I_{c} measurement system that can carry out accurate I_{c} measurement for HTS short samples with various temperatures (4.2–80 K), magnetic fields (0–14 T), and angles of the magnetic field (0°–90°) has been developed. The I_{c} measurement system mainly consists of a measurement holder, temperature-control system, background magnet, test cryostat, data acquisition system, and DC power supply. The accuracy of temperature control is better than ±0.1 K over the 20–80 K range and ±0.05 K when measured below 20 K. The maximum current is over 1000 A with a measurement uncertainty of 1%. The system had been successfully used for YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-x}(YBCO) tapes I_{c} determination with different temperatures and magnetic fields.
I. INTRODUCTION
Since high-temperature superconductivity was first discovered in 1986 by Bednorz and Muller [1], it has elicited widespread interest in the world for its high critical temperature (T_{c}) and upper critical magnetic field (H_{c2}). After years of development, the performance of high-temperature superconductors (HTS) is substantially increased, and their cost is reduced [2,3]. They are potential materials for high-field magnets [4], low-loss transmission cables [5], Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES) [6], and resistive/inductive fault current limiters [7].
The temperature parameter has long been known to affect the critical current (I_{c}) of superconducting materials. Variable-temperature I_{c} measurements are needed to determine the temperature margins for studies of superconductor stability. They are also required for designing magnets that operate at temperatures other than the canonical 4.2 K or 77 K [8].
At the University of Geneva [9,10] and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) [11], helium gas flow in a variable temperature insert (VTI) was used to cool the sample. In addition, two Cernox thermometers, above and below the sample, controlled the temperature and its uniformity. The helium gas flowed along the length of the sample. As a result, there was an inevitable temperature gradient along the sample. There are many examples of vacuum-can design with helium exchange gas [12–14]. Typically in this approach, the sample space was vacuum sealed and a controlled, small amount of helium was introduced into the sealed space to cool the sample. A special seal structure was required for the vacuum feedthrough for current leads and signal leads. It was difficult to determine the amount of helium gas to get better temperature control accuracy and reduce the time needed for the temperature controllers to settle at the same time. The measurement current was usually in the low level.
It is a trade-off process among complexity, temperature uncertainty, and current level. We used the inverted, insulating G10 container design, and the sample was mounted in the horizontal direction theoretically without temperature gradients. Moreover, high temperature superconducting current leads were used to reduce the heat leakage and the current contacts were made into replaceable form with different angles to study the anisotropy. This system was successfully used to carry out I_{c} measurement for the YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-x}(YBCO) samples with various temperatures (4.2–80 K), magnetic fields (0–14 T), and angles of the magnetic field (0°–90°).
II. MEASUREMENT SYSTEM
The critical current is one of the most important principal engineering design parameters for applications. It is an extrinsic property and depends strongly on the magnetic fields and temperature. The used I_{c} measurement method is based on the four-probe DC transport method. The current and voltage of the specimen under specific conditions (temperature, magnetic fields, and angles of the magnetic field) are continuously recorded. The critical current is the corresponding current when a certain threshold of voltage or resistance is exceeded.
The I_{c} measurement system mainly consists of a measurement holder, temperature-control system, background magnet, test cryostat, data acquisition system, and DC power supply, as shown in Fig. 1. The measurement holder is inserted into the test cryostat and can ensure that the specimen is in the center of the magnetic field.
A. Measurement holder and sample preparation
The measurement holder is made up of a specimen holder, a current lead, a current contact, a G10 container, and support structures, as shown in Fig. 2(a).
The specimen holder is made of G10 with the specimen lying in the plane of the fabric wrap for the thermal contraction of G10 in the wrap direction is similar to specimen [15,16]. This specimen holder can reduce the strain introduced by different thermal contraction and avoid current leakage through the holder. In order to avoid stress concentration, the mounting surfaces of the current contacts and specimen holder are of the same level. For the purpose of reducing heat leakage through the current lead, a pair of current leads with both Nb_{3}Sn wires and Bi-2223 tapes is used to feed the specimen. Nb_{3}Sn wires are soldered to the surface of the lower part of the current lead outside the G10 container, and Bi-2223 tapes are soldered to the surface of the two legs of the current lead inside the G10 container, as shown in Fig. 2(a). Replaceable current contacts with different angles are used to measure the specimen in different magnetic field angles. The term angle, θ, refers to the angle between the magnetic field strength vector H→ and the wide surface of the tape specimen, as shown in Fig. 2(b).
After heat treated (if needed), the ends of the specimen should be trimmed to suit the specimen holder. The length of the specimen must be more than 5 times the width or diameter of the specimen [17] because enough length is required for specimen soldering to acquire low resistance joints, current transfer, and I_{c} determination. The total length of the specimen is usually 5 cm, and the lengths for each joint soldering and I_{c} determination are 1 cm and 1–2 cm, respectively. Before soldering the current contacts to the two legs of the current lead, the specimen will be first mounted to the flat surface of the specimen holder, and both the ends of specimen will be soldered to the current contacts. It is more convenient and safe to solder the specimen to the current contact before soldering the current contacts to the current lead. The solder used for the current contacts and current leads soldering was 90In/10Sn with the melting temperature of 143 °C which is much lower than 60Sn/40Pb of 183 °C used for the specimen and current contacts soldering.
Voltage leads should be twisted and placed in the central part along the specimen length. Special attention must be paid to confirm the distance between the voltage tap and the current contact because current transfer length is required for the current to go through the superconducting layer [16]. Two pairs of voltage taps, one with 1–2 cm distance for I_{c} determination and the other with the specimen whole length (5 cm) for joint resistance monitor, are usually measured at the same time.
In order to reduce the motion caused by the Lorentz force, low-temperature adhesive can be used to bond the specimen, and special attention should be paid to the direction of current flow to make sure the Lorentz force is against the surface of the specimen holder. Before immersed into liquid helium, the specimen is pre-cooled by liquid nitrogen slowly. Either constant sweep rate method or ramp-and-hold method can be used for the I_{c} measurement.
B. Temperature-control system
Figure 2(b) shows the detail image of the specimen holder. Two Cernox thermometers are installed on the current contacts, and there are two heaters made of manganese-copper wire wound on the two legs of current leads. The two heaters are, respectively, controlled by a temperature controller with two control loops according to the respective measured temperature. Figure 3 shows the schematic diagram of the temperature-control system. The temperature controller uses a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) algorithm to adjust the heating power of the heater. The difference between measured temperature and the given temperature is the error signal for the temperature controller.
The G10 container is filled with liquid helium (LHe), and the specimen is immersed in LHe when measured in 4.2 K. When the specimen needs to be measured above 4.2 K, the upper part of LHe in the G10 container is heated to GHe, and the lower part of LHe is pushed out through the helium path. The specimen will then be cooled by helium gas, and a dynamic equilibrium of helium level can be acquired at the given temperature. One possible inner helium level when measured above 4.2 K is shown in Fig. 2(b).
Figure 4(a) shows the measured temperature during the I_{c} test at 40 K with a vertical magnetic field of 1 T. Figure 4(b) shows the test results at 20 K with a vertical magnetic field of 1 T. During the period of current sweep, the temperature of the specimen was quite stable. The temperature of the specimen can be controlled from 4.2 K to 80 K and the accuracy of temperature is better than ±0.1 K in the range of 20–80 K and ±0.05 K when measured below 20 K.
C. Background magnet
The background magnet is a superconducting solenoid magnet with a clear central bore of 70 mm. The inner and outer coils are wound by Nb_{3}Sn and NbTi wires, respectively. It can provide a maximum magnetic field of 14 T at 4.2 K. The homogeneity over 32 mm diameter and ±17.5 mm axially about the field center is 99.5%.
The magnet is connected in parallel with a superconducting switch. The working condition of the superconducting switch is controlled by a heating wire. When the magnet is energized, the heating wire is heated, and the switch is under the normal condition. When the current reaches the current required for a particular magnetic field, the heating wire is turned off, and the switch is under the superconducting condition, the magnet works in a closed loop.
D. Data acquisition system
The data acquisition system includes the Keithley 2182A nanovoltmeter and PCI-9114 data acquisition card. The collection program is written by LabVIEW. The specimen current is determined by the voltage across a standard resistor in series. The accuracy of current is better than 1%. The specimen voltage is measured by a nanovoltmeter. The temperature of the specimen is determined by the Cernox temperature sensors with low-magnetoresistance effect [8,18].
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Several critical current measurements of various HTS short samples under different conditions had been carried out. Figure 5 shows the I_{c} measurement results of a YBCO tape which was supplied by Shanghai Superconductor Technology Co., Ltd. It was manufactured using the physical vapor deposition method with an outer dimension of 4.8 mm × 0.12 mm. BP represents parallel magnetic field, and test results with BT were tested with the vertical magnetic field.
The sample was measured, respectively, in 4.2 K, 20 K, 30 K, 40 K with different parallel magnetic fields and vertical magnetic fields. The electric field criterion 1 μV/cm was used for I_{c} determination. The YBCO tape has strong anisotropy and is more sensitive to the vertical field intensity. The measured critical current in the same temperature with the vertical magnetic field is much smaller compared to that with the parallel magnetic field. The critical current decreases as magnetic field intensity increases or temperature increases. The critical current in 4.2 K with a 12 T vertical magnetic field is more than 200 A.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
A new critical current measurement system that can carry out I_{c} measurement for HTS short samples at various temperatures ranging from 4.2 K to 80 K and in magnetic fields in the 0-14 T range with magnetic field angles of 0°–90° is presented in this paper. It is made up of a measurement holder, temperature-control system, background magnet, test cryostat, data acquisition system, and DC power supply. The accuracy of temperature is better than ±0.1 K over the 20-80 K range and ±0.05 K when measured below 20 K.
The dependence of temperature and magnetic fields on critical current has been investigated. The YBCO tape has strong anisotropy and is more sensitive to the vertical field intensity.
