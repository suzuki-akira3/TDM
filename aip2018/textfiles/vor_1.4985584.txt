Photothermoelastic contrast in nanoscale infrared spectroscopy
The contrast formation mechanism in nanoscale Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy is analyzed. The temperature distribution and elastic displacement across the illuminated T-shape boundary between two materials with different IR-radiation absorption coefficients and thermo-physical and elastic properties located on a rigid substrate are calculated self-consistently for different frequencies f ∼ (1 kHz–1 MHz) of IR-radiation modulation (fully coupled problem). Analytical expressions for the temperature and displacement profiles across the “thermo-elastic step” are derived in the decoupling approximation for f =0 (“static limit”), and conditions for approximation validity at low frequencies of IR-modulation are established. The step height was found to be thickness-independent for thick layers and proportional to the square of the thickness for very thin films. The theoretical results will be of potential interest for applications in the scanning thermo-ionic and thermal infrared microscopies for relatively long sample thermalization times and possibly for photothermal induced resonance microscopy using optomechanical probes.
The push towards studying materials and systems in the nanoscale range creates the opportunity for addressing challenges of developing more energy efficient energy harvesting materials. In particular, infrared (IR) spectroscopy is a well-explored analytical technique that finds numerous applications in chemistry [1,2], on-line monitoring sensors [3], and industrial set-ups [4]. It is based on the absorption of irradiation at resonant frequencies corresponding to molecular vibrational modes [5–7]. Transmission IR microscopy is diffraction limited, and subsequently, its spatial resolution lies in the range of 3–15 μm, while in the total internal reflection mode, the resolution can be further improved by a factor of 4 [8–10].
To improve the resolution of IR spectroscopy, the combination of atomic force microscopy (AFM) with IR spectroscopy (AFM-IR) was proposed. AFM-IR utilizes the detection of the nanoscale displacement of the AFM tip originating from material thermal expansion induced by the absorbed IR radiation of the short laser pulse with a duration of ∼10 ns. AFM-IR offers the significant scaling down of the size of the probed region to ∼20 nm and allows probing of local properties of polymers [11–13], nanocomposites [14], biological samples [15–18], semiconductors [19,20], and hybrid perovskites [21]. There has been a significant progress towards the improvement of the AFM-IR [22–25] in terms of resolution and functionality. However, the contrast formation mechanisms remain poorly understood. Dazzi et_al [26] developed a framework theory that describes the dynamic signal generation in AFM-IR paying special attention to the dynamics of the cantilever. However, the nature of light-induced material responses remains generally unexplored.
Similar to AFM-IR, the contrast observed in scanning thermal infrared microscopy (STIRM), where the probe measures the local temperature changes in the sample [27], relies on short laser pulses, which can significantly overlap in thick samples with relatively low thermal conductivity (e.g., for long thermalization times up to 100 μs). The lateral resolution in STIRM can be several hundreds of nm, and this is ten times more than that of AFM-IR which can reach spatial resolution down to 20 nm as discussed previously [22–27]. Recently, Chae et_al [28] used ultrafast nanoscale optomechanical AFM probes to study the thermal expansion dynamics of the sample in the photothermal induced resonance (PTIR) method. It appears that the optomechanical probes allow advanced STIRM-type measurements with more than 10^{3} times faster temporal resolution by the direct measurement of the sample thermal expansion, instead of the sample temperature measurements as in conventional STIRM. To date, scanning thermo-ionic microscopy (STIM) [29–31], wherein both thermal and Vegard strains are considered, is evolving.
In this work, we calculate self-consistently the temperature distribution and elastic displacement across an illuminated T-shape boundary between two materials with different IR-light absorption coefficients. Thermo-physical and elastic parameters of film located on a rigid substrate are calculated numerically for different frequencies f ∼ (1 kHz–100 MHz) of IR-radiation modulation (coupled dynamic problem). The profile of the thermo-elastic response is calculated analytically in the decoupling approximation for the static case f =0.
Our solutions of coupled and decoupled problems are based on the extension of the resolution theory of piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) [32–37] and electrochemical strain microscopy (ESM) [38,39]. Here, a film of thickness h is comprised of regions A and B separated by a vertical boundary AB, deposited on top of substrate C [Fig. 1(a)]. The film top surface is illuminated by periodically modulated IR-radiation, with a modulation frequency f = (1 kHz–100 MHz). The IR irradiation is adsorbed according to the Beer-Lambert-Bouguer law, and the generated heat causes local thermal expansion in the material. The thermal expansion causes a bulk strain leading to surface deformation. Here, we aim to calculate the mechanical displacement profile across the A-B boundary caused by IR-irradiation that can be measured experimentally via the AFM probe tip [Fig. 1(b)]. We do not consider cantilever dynamics that can be analyzed via transfer function theory [40].
Distribution of the temperature variations ϑ_{m}(x,z,t) from the absolute temperature T_{0} inside each region is described by a coupled system of thermal conductivity equations
where m=A,B,C corresponds to film regions A (x≤0,0≤z≤h at t = 0), B (x≥0,0≤z≤h at t = 0), and C (−∞<x<∞,h<z<H), respectively. Note that the physical boundary S_{AB} between the regions A and B can shift with time. The top surface z=0 also bends due to the thermo-elastic effects, and numerical simulations account for all these changes in a self-consistent way. Thermal diffusivities κ_{m}=kmT/c_{m} are introduced, where c_{m} is the heat capacity and kmT is the thermal conductivity of a region “m.” We assume that the density of all thermal sources q_{m}(x,z,t) is proportional to the irradiation intensity distribution given by the Beer–Lambert–Bouguer law, q_{m}(x,z,t)=α_{m}I_{0}(x,t)exp(−α_{m}z), where z≥0 and I_{0}(x,t)=I_{0}(t)exp(−λ|x|). The decay constant 0≤λ≪α_{m} is very small. The intensity I_{0}(t) is periodically modulated with linear frequency f,I_{0}(t)=I_{0}sin(2πft). The absorption coefficients α_{m} are different for regions A, B, and C.
The thermal boundary conditions (BCs) used for Eq. (1) at the top surface have the form of heat balanced equations with different heat transfer coefficients g_{m} between the top surfaces of the regions A and B and the environment [41]. Namely, the normal components of the heat fluxes are proportional to the temperature, kmT(∂ϑm/∂n→)|{Sm}=g_{m}ϑ_{m}(x,z,t) (m =A, B). BCs at the physical boundaries AB, AC, and BC are the continuity of heat fluxes and the equality of the layers' temperatures, e.g., kAT∂ϑ_{A}∂n→−kBT∂ϑB∂n→|{SAB}=0, ϑ_{A}−ϑB|{SAB}=0. The BCs at the substrate-film interface (z=h) are kAT∂ϑ_{A}∂z−kCT∂ϑC∂z|{SAC}=0, ϑ_{A}−ϑC|{SAC}=0 and kBT∂ϑ_{B}∂z−kCT∂ϑC∂z|{SBC}=0, ϑ_{B}−ϑC|{SBC}=0. BCs at the boundary z=H between the thick substrate of thickness H and its surroundings depend on the thermophysical properties of the ambient environment. We use the limits that fix the temperature variation, ϑC|{z=H}=0, corresponding to the contact with a thermostat (approximated by a thick metallic slab in realistic experiment) or with air, corresponding to the BC −kCT(∂ϑC/∂n→)|{SC}=−g_{C}ϑ{C}(x,z,t).
Generalized Hooke's law relating elastic stresses and strains in a thermo-elastic problem for each of the regions A, B, and C has the form σ_{pq}=cpqijm(u_{ij}−βijmϑ_{m}), where m =A, B, and C without summation, u_{ij} is the strain tensor, cpqijm and sijklm are the elastic stiffness and compliances tensors, βijm is the thermal expansion tensor. Hereinafter, we use x=x_{1}, y=x_{2}, and z=x_{3}. We note that the typical tip probe contact area in an AFM experiment is well below the micron-scale. Therefore, the corresponding intrinsic resonance frequencies of a material are in the GHz range. This is well above the limits imposed by ion dynamics and AFM-based detection of localized mechanical vibrations. Hence, we can solve the equation of mechanical equilibrium in the quasi-static case, ∂σ_{ij}/∂x_{j}=0. This along with Hooke's law leads to the Lame-type equations for mechanical displacement vector U_{k}
Elastic BCs to Eq. (2) correspond to the absence of the normal stresses on mechanically free surfaces of media “A” and “B” (σpqnq)|{Sm}≡cpqijmnq(uijm−βijmϑm)|{Sm}=0 (m = A, B). At the interface between “A” and “B” conditions of continuity of normal stresses (σpqnq)|{SAB−0}=(σpqnq)|{SAB+0} and mechanical displacement Ui|{SAB−0}=Ui|{SAB+0} should be satisfied. Elastic displacements should be continuous (UiA|{SAC}=UiB|{SBC}) or zero on the boundary with matched or rigid substrate, respectively. The coupled thermo-elastic boundary problem (1)–(2) has been solved numerically, and the results are presented below.
Distributions of temperature variation ϑ(x,z) and strain component u_{33}(x,z) correspond to the solution of the coupled Eqs. (1) and (2) obtained from the finite elements modeling (FEM) and are presented in Figs. 2 and 3. Regions A and B corresponding to poly-methyl-methacrylate (PMMA) and epoxy, which are from 0.1 μm to 3 μm thick, are located on top of a Si-substrate C with a thickness of 0.6–6 μm. The substrates are in contact with either a perfectly heat conducting metal or poorly conducting air. Since the thermal conductivity of the Si substrate is about 750 times higher than the conductivities of PMMA-epoxy, Si acts as a very effective heat sink when it is either thick enough (2–μm or thicker) or in contact with a heat conducting metal [see Figs. S1 and S2 in the supplementary material]. The thermo-elastic response calculated for a 6–μm or thicker Si-substrate (semi-infinite limit) appeared almost the same as the ones for the 0.6 μm Si-substrate on a perfectly conducting metal.
We chose the model system “PMMA-epoxy” [27] due to its perfect compatibility with many other materials in polymer-polymer, polymer-oxide, polymer-semiconductor, and nano-composite thin-film diphasic structures on a Si-substrates [42–46]. PMMA and epoxy have close elastic and thermal parameters (within 5%–20%) and significantly different IR-irradiation absorption coefficients, α_{A} = 3.5 × 10^{4} m^{−1} and α_{B} = 10^{6} m^{−1}, at an IR wavelength of 3.5 μm for PMMA and epoxy, respectively.
Further, we calculated the temperature change and strain for parameters listed in Table SI in the supplementary material. According to the table, the epoxy region has 30 times higher absorption than PMMA, and so, inhomogeneous heating occurs in epoxy and creates inhomogeneous strains with a maximal value of 0.05% for h = 1 μm [Fig. 2(a)]. Since thermal and elastic parameters of PMMA and epoxy are relatively close, the step is almost absent at equal absorption coefficients α_{A}=α_{B}; it becomes noticeable [∼(10–100) pm] for h ≥ 0.5 μm if the coefficients differ by a factor of 30.
We explore the frequency and film thickness dependence of surface temperature variation ϑ(x,0) and vertical displacement u_{3}(x). Three regions of the signal thickness dependence exist [Fig. 2(b)], namely, the displacement step full height defined as δu_{3}=u_{3}(x→−∞)−u_{3}(x→+∞) [see Fig. 1(b)] increases nonlinearly at small thickness h, δu_{3}∼h^{3}, followed by a wide quasi-linear region δu_{3}∼h and further slow saturation with the increase in h. The proportionality δu_{3}∼h agrees qualitatively with available experiments [17,22]. In particular, Lahiri et_al [22] revealed that the AFM‐IR signal (with a 1 kHz laser) increases approximately linearly with the thickness for thicknesses up to 1 μm. Baldassarre et_al [17] observed the linear signal up to 450 nm thickness using the resonant cantilever excitation method with 200 kHz laser pulses. The most likely reason of the evident disagreement between the calculated (∼h^{3}) and measured (∼h) responses at film thickness h below 250 nm is the difference in excitation regimes (sinusoidal modulation vs. short pulses).
We observe the dependence of ϑ(x,0) and u_{3}(x) on the distance to the epoxy-PMMA boundary which has the form of smoothed steps, with the height and width strongly dependent on IR-modulation frequency f at fixed h [Fig. 3]. Note that the curves calculated for f ≤ (1–10) kHz almost coincide with the ones for f =0, and this gives us solid grounds to use analytical results derived in the static limit and presented below for the moderate and low frequency range. Remarkably, higher modulation frequency would provide significantly higher spatial resolution at the expense of a lower response intensity [compare much lower and sharp steps for f = (10–100) MHz with smooth and high steps for f ≤ (1–10) kHz in Fig. 3].
Notably, the high frequency response from 100 MHz sinusoidal modulation [shown in Fig. 3] is not equivalent to the response on 10 ns pulses because the effects of the AFM tip response to a sharp pulse should be taken into account. That is to say, the spectra should be convoluted with the transfer function of the cantilever, and the circumstance seriously complicates the theory. Here, we develop the theoretical model for sinusoidal IR-excitation and defer the theory for sharp modulated spike-like pulses for the future studies.
To develop an analytical solution, we employ a decoupled approximation [32–35].^{,} [38] In this case, it is assumed that the solution of the thermal problem yields thermal fields inside the material, and so, the temperature change generates stress fields; however, the mechanical displacement does not affect the solution of the thermal problem. The decoupling approximation is typically applicable for a thermo-elastic response, since the inverse impact of the strain on the heat transfer is proportional to the dimensionless difference of the heat capacities at fixed pressure and volume, (C_{p}−C_{V})/C_{p}, which is usually negligibly small [47]. For linearization of decoupled thermo-elastic equations, the intensity I_{0} should be small; otherwise, the coupled problem needs to be solved. Since the criteria for intensity smallness appear rather uncertain for IR, the direct comparison of the coupled and decoupled solutions should be performed, as it was demonstrated earlier for PFM [36] and ESM [39].
To derive an analytical linear solution for the thermo-elastic problem, we assume that all elastic and thermal properties of media A and B are the same (cpqijA≈cpqijB, c_{A}≈c_{B}≈c_{F}, kAT≈kBT≈kFT, and g_{A}≈g_{B}≈g_{F}, where the subscript “F” corresponds to the film), except for the IR-irradiation adsorption coefficients (α_{A}≠α_{B}). Materials A and B are placed on an elastically matched IR-transparent substrate that is in thermal contact with the perfectly conducting metal. For the isotropic thermal expansion tensor, β_{11}=β_{22}=β_{33}=β, we derived Fourier images of the temperature variation and vertical surface displacement that depends on the frequency ω and wave vector k [see Appendix B in the supplementary material]. Initial estimations show that the static limit (f→0) can be a reasonable approximation for moderate and low frequencies 2πf<αm2/κ_{F} corresponding to kHz for epoxy-PMMA pair [see Fig. 3]. For f=0, the displacement x-profile has the form
where the function u_{f} is introduced as
Parameter α is equal to α_{A} or α_{B} in the right-hand side of Eq. (4). The function F is
Parameter γ is equal to α or g_{F}/kFT in the right-hand side of Eq. (7). At λ → 0, the height of the step, δu_{3}=u_{3}(x→−∞)−u_{3}(x→+∞), can be estimated as
The height δu_{3} is proportional to the difference (α_{A}−α_{B}) and inversely proportional to the heat transfer coefficient g_{F}. The step is thickness-independent for thick films (δu_{3}≈(1+ν)βI_{0}4πg_{F}α_{B}−α_{A}α_{A}α_{B} for h≫max[αA−1,αB−1]), proportional to h for thinner films (δu_{3}≈(1+ν)βI_{0}4πg_{F}(2h−1α_{B}) for αB−1≪h<αA−1 and α_{A}≪α_{B}), and proportional to h^{2} for very thin films (δu_{3}≈(1+ν)βI_{0}4πg_{F}h^{2}2(α_{A}−α_{B}) for h≪min[αA−1,αB−1]) [see Fig. 4(a)]. Actually, one can see a wide quasi-linear region at a small thickness in Fig. 4(a), and the linear trend qualitatively agrees with experiments [17,22].
Using Eqs. (3)–(5), the lateral resolution, defined by the width δw of the 95% step to 5% of the thermo-elastic response transient region [see Fig. 1(b)], can be estimated as
Profiles of u_{3}(x) across the boundary AB calculated from Eqs. (3)–(5) for the thick film with different ratios of α_{B}/α_{A} and effective thermal transfer parameters (α_{A}kFT)/g_{F} are shown in Figs. 4(b) and 4(c). The step-like changes of the profile are pronounced in the case when the ratio α_{B}/α_{A} strongly differs from unity [Fig. 4(b)]. Small ratio (α_{A}kFT)/g_{F} corresponds to the sufficiently sharp step on u_{3}(x) at fixed ratio α_{B}/α_{A}, but the total amplitude of the surface displacement is still rather small [Fig. 4(c)]. Note that high ratio (α_{A}kFT)/g_{F} corresponds to smooth profiles with wide transient regions, and the amplitude of u_{3}(x) is rather high [Fig. S2(d)].
The analytical solution obtained in the linear decoupling approximation [Fig. 4] matches semi-quantitatively to the numerical solution of a coupled thermo-elastic problem for thick films [Fig. 3] if the IR-modulation frequency is less than 10 kHz and media A and B having close elastic and thermo-physical parameters. However, it can differ in IR-absorption coefficients. This permits us to generalize the conclusions made on the basis of linear theory in the decoupling approximation for thermal and elastic fields towards the case of a coupled nonlinear thermo-elastic response.
Note that we neglected the interfacial thermal resistance [48,49] in our calculations primarily because we did not find the resistances of PMMA‐epoxy, PMMA‐Si, and epoxy‐Si interfaces. However, the interfacial thermal resistance can qualitatively affect the spatial resolution in nanoscale IR-microscopy, e.g., to improve STIM and STIRM resolution because it slows down the heat diffusion significantly important for the AFM‐IR (that is, the signal is determined at short timescales).
Using the theory of heat conductivity and thermo-elasticity, we calculated self-consistently the dynamic thermo-elastic response of an illuminated T-shape boundary between two layers (PMMA and epoxy) with strongly different IR-radiation absorption coefficients and weakly different thermo-physical and elastic properties. For low frequencies of IR-modulation, analytical dependences of the temperature and elastic strain distributions on layer thickness, adsorption coefficients, and thermo-physical and elastic parameters were derived in the linear decoupling approximation for layers that differ only by their adsorption coefficients. The obtained theoretical results are of potential interest for applications in STIM and STRIM microscopies; however, our approach requires serious modifications for applications in advanced AFM-IR with optomechanical probes. Actually, our results are neither directly applicable nor comparable with AFM-IR measurements, where short IR-pulses are used [11–26]. Specifically, the response from high frequency sinusoidal IR-modulation [shown in Fig. 3] is not equivalent to the response on 10 ns IR-pulses because the effects of the AFM tip response to the pulses (transfer function of the cantilever) should be taken into account.
