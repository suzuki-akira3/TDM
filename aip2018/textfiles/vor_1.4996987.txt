Self-diffusion in single crystalline silicon nanowires
Self-diffusion experiments in single crystalline isotopically controlled silicon nanowires with diameters of 70 and 400 nm at 850 and 1000°C are reported. The isotope structures were first epitaxially grown on top of silicon substrate wafers. Nanowires were subsequently fabricated using a nanosphere lithography process in combination with inductively coupled plasma dry reactive ion etching. Three-dimensional profiling of the nanosized structure before and after diffusion annealing was performed by means of atom probe tomography (APT). Self-diffusion profiles obtained from APT analyses are accurately described by Fick's law for self-diffusion. Data obtained for silicon self-diffusion in nanowires are equal to the results reported for bulk silicon crystals, i.e., finite size effects and high surface-to-volume ratios do not significantly affect silicon self-diffusion. This shows that the properties of native point defects determined from self-diffusion in bulk crystals also hold for nanosized silicon structures with diameters down to 70 nm.
I. INTRODUCTION
The ability to control the impurity level, i.e., the incorporation of defects at the atomic scale, is one of the main factors for the revolutionary development of semiconductor devices over the last six decades. The properties of point defects in silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge), i.e., their type, mobility, interaction, and electronic behavior, are well understood to some extent, because of the progress achieved in spectroscopic and diffusion studies over the past decades and recently by means of isotopically controlled Si and Ge structures [1–8]. However, the properties of dopants and self-atoms determined for bulk materials are not necessarily applicable to nanoscale Si and Ge structures because, in small dimensions, the thermodynamics and kinetics of point defects can be different from those in the bulk [9,10]. Surface and interface states can affect the behavior of point defects in the whole nanostructure due to the high surface/interface-to-volume ratio.
Numerous diffusion studies with group-IV semiconductors have been performed over the past decades. These studies comprise both self- and dopant diffusion experiments that, according to common practice, were mainly performed separately (see, e.g., Ref [1]). More recently, the availability of highly enriched Si and Ge isotopes and the development of epitaxial layer deposition systems have enabled the growth of high purity epitaxial layers with homogeneous chemical composition, but with alternating isotopic composition. Isotopically controlled semiconductor heterostructures grown by means of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) are very advantageous for studying self-diffusion [11–18], the impact of doping and dopant diffusion on self-diffusion [4,5,6,19], and self-diffusion under non-equilibrium conditions established, e.g., by irradiation [20–22]. With state-of-the-art depth profiling techniques such as secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), neutron reflectometry (NR), and atom probe tomography (APT), even small diffusion lengths of a few nanometers can be resolved. In particular, the APT technique is very advantageous for 3 D profiling of semiconductor nanostructures, since it provides both high depth and lateral resolution [23–26].
Today, nanoelectronic devices progressively consist of thin layered materials where the defect density limits their integrity. Further miniaturization demands an improved understanding of the properties and interaction of atomic defects. This involves the interaction of defects within the bulk as well as with surfaces and interfaces, since the surface- and interface-to-volume ratios increase with decreasing size of electronic devices. Atomistic calculations have been increasingly used to predict the types of defects and their interactions, stability, mobility, and electronic properties [27]. However, the relevance of theoretical results still needs to be verified experimentally.
Several methods, besides the APT technique [28,29], had already been explored to determine the dopant distribution in nanostructures, which comprise scanning spreading resistance microscopy (SSRM) [29,30], Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) [31], scanning photocurrent microscopy [32], capacitance-voltage profiling [33], and Raman spectroscopy [34]. Dopant and carrier distributions of Si nanostructures prepared by both bottom-up [28,31–34] and top-down [29,30] approaches were investigated. In the bottom-up approach, Si nanowires are generally prepared by the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) growth process utilizing gold (Au) particles as a growth catalyst. Since Au is known to introduce deep donor and acceptor states in the band gap of silicon and compensates both shallow acceptor and donor dopants, the impact of Au on the electrical properties of Si nanowires prepared by the VLS growth remains a matter of concern. On the other hand, nanostructuring of Si in a top-down approach involves lithography, etching, deposition, and chemical-mechanical polishing steps. This approach is more defined with respect to the level of foreign-atom contamination than the VLS growth process.
Irrespective of the methods used to fabricate nanosized semiconductor devices, the dopant distribution and the surface states determine the electronic properties of the nanostructure. Therefore, those two parameters must be controlled. This requires a quantitative understanding on the atomic transport in nanoscale semiconductors, the electrical activation of dopants, and the impact of surface states. Dopant profiling in nanostructures was already demonstrated with the techniques mentioned earlier, and differences in dopant diffusion compared to bulk semiconductors were ascertained [30,31]. However, the experimental results did not provide in-depth information about the dopant-defect interactions and properties of the defects involved. In particular, the most fundamental process of mass transport in condensed matter, i.e., the self-diffusion process, was not yet studied in, e.g., nanosized Si structures rigorously. Utilizing Si wafers with isotopically modulated multilayers for nanostructuring in a top-down approach and applying the APT technique for 3 D profiling of the nanoobject, experimental studies on atomic transport in nanoscale Si are feasible, the results of which are reported in this work.
II. EXPERIMENTAL
Two different isotopically modulated Si structures were used in this study. Structure #1 consists of five bilayers with a 120 nm thick highly enriched isotopic ^{28}Si layer and a 100 nm thick layer of natural isotopic abundance ({nat}Si). The structure was grown by means of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on top of a boron doped (ρ>10Ωcm) floating-zone (FZ) (100)-oriented Si wafer. Structure #2 comprises 20 undoped alternating (^{28}Si/^{30}Si)-bilayers grown by means of molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on top of an undoped (100)-oriented CZ-Si wafer. The thickness of each single layer is ≈10nm. Samples with lateral dimensions of 15×15mm^{2} were cut from the wafers with structures #1 and #2, and subsequently nanostructured to realize vertically aligned Si nanowires (SiNWs). Nanowires with diameters of 400 and 70 nm were prepared from structures #1 and #2, respectively. The nanofabrication of three-dimensional isotopically modulated Si nanowires involving nanosphere lithography and inductively coupled plasma dry reactive ion etching (ICP-DRIE) has been described by Hamdana et_al [35] in more detail.
Samples with lateral dimensions of 3×3mm^{2} were cut from the wafer pieces with isotopically controlled SiNWs. Additionally, samples of 5×5mm^{2} were diced from the original wafers with structures #1 and #2. All samples were subjected to the standard RCA cleaning procedure. A boron-doped FZ-Si wafer material with a specific resistivity of 800Ωcm, carbon and oxygen concentrations of ≤5×10^{15}cm^{−3} and ≈3×10^{15}cm^{−3}, respectively, was crushed into pieces of 1−5mm. The crushed Si was etched in a CP6 etching solution for 30s and purged with distilled water. The etching solution is composed of nitric acid (70 vol. %), hydrofluoric acid (50 vol. %), and acetic acid (98 vol. %) in a volume fraction of 2:1:1. Samples with and without SiNWs were embedded in ≈3cm^{3} crushed Si and sealed within quartz glass ampoules evacuated to a pressure of 10^{−6}mbar after flushing the ampoule volume several times with argon (purity: 99.998%). Diffusion annealing of samples in crushed-Si minimizes the risk of foreign atom residues that can react with the sample surface and alter self-diffusion during annealing, as demonstrated in Ref [18]. Samples of structure #1 were annealed in a resistance heated furnace at 1000°C for 1h and 4h, and samples of structure #2 were annealed at 850°C for 48h. Samples with isotopically enriched SiNWs and the corresponding bulk isotope samples were annealed simultaneously in the same ampoule.
After annealing, samples with SiNWs were coated with a protective 100nm thick Ni layer via physical vapor deposition. Needle shaped tips with a diameter of <40nm were milled from SiNWs by means of a focused ion beam (FIB). APT analyses were performed utilizing a LEAP 3000X HR instrument with a detection efficiency of about 35%. The temperature of the tip sample holder was set to 50K in a vacuum chamber evacuated to a pressure of <2×10^{−11}mbar. The laser pulse rate and energy were set to 100kHz and 0.7nJ, respectively, for the evaporation of Si atoms from the tip surface. The reconstruction of the collected APT data was performed with IVAS software using a shank-angle method and assuming an evaporation field of 30V/nm.
Time-of-flight SIMS (ToF-SIMS) analyses of the bulk isotope structure #2 were conducted before and after annealing at 850^{°}C for 48h. SIMS was performed in a dual beam mode with 1keV oxygen ions for depth sputtering and 25keV bismuth ions for analysis. The depths of the SIMS craters were determined with an optical profilometer and used to convert the sputter time to the penetration depth assuming a constant sputter rate during SIMS analysis. The SIMS ion counts were transferred to Si isotope concentrations considering the ion counts of the Si isotopes under natural abundance. The concentration-depth profiles are accurately described by the solution of Fick's law for self-diffusion across interfaces
where C_{1} and C_{2} are the minimum and maximum concentrations, erf is the error function, and r_{i} represents the characteristic diffusion length r_{i}=2DSiSDt or broadening of the interface i at depth x_{i}. The parameter r_{i} reveals the Si self-diffusion coefficient DSiSD for each interface, considering the annealing time t of the particular isothermal diffusion experiment.
III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
Figure 1 illustrates a scanning electron micrograph of SiNWs with a diameter of about 70 nm after successful nanofabrication of the Si sample with the epilayer structure #2. Additional SiNWs with 400 nm diameter were prepared from the epilayer structure #1. An APT analysis of a SiNW with structure #1 after the nanofabrication process and before annealing is shown in Fig. 2. The analysis reveals a sharp increase (decrease) of the ^{30}Si concentration at the ^{28}Si/^{nat}Si (^{nat}Si/^{28}Si) interface at a depth of about 90 nm (190 nm) from the top of the tip. The broadening r obtained by fitting Eq. (1) to the experimental profile [see the solid line in Fig. 2(b)] is less than 1nm at both interfaces. This broadening is lower than that obtained from the SIMS analysis of the bulk structure #1 [see the dashed line in Fig. 2(b)]. This not only demonstrates that APT provides a better depth resolution than SIMS, but also shows that the fabrication process of SiNWs does not induce any significant broadening of the isotope structure. On the other hand, the background noise level of the APT detection of ^{30}Si is higher than that of the SIMS measurement as demonstrated by the higher ^{30}Si concentration detected by APT within the enriched ^{28}Si layers.
An APT analysis of a 400 nm SiNW with structure #1 after annealing at 1000°C for 1h is depicted in Fig. 3(a), which is a two-dimensional projection of the APT data after reconstruction. A significant broadening is evident at the initial sharp interfaces. The ^{30}Si concentration profile shown in Fig. 3(b) (see symbols) demonstrates the increased broadening at the ^{28}Si/^{nat}Si and ^{nat}Si/^{28}Si interfaces in comparison to the broadening of the as-grown bulk structure #1 measured by SIMS [see the dashed line in Fig. 3(b)]. The APT reconstruction of a 70 nm diameter SiNW with isotope structure #2 performed after annealing at 850^{°}C for 48h is shown in Fig. 4(a). Figure 4(b) illustrates the concentration profile of ^{30}Si extracted from a cylindrical region of the tip [see the region surrounded by the black box in Fig. 4(a)]. Four ^{28}Si/^{30}Si interfaces with a pronounced broadening (see symbols) compared to the as-grown structure #2 [see the dashed line in Fig. 4(b)] are clearly resolved.
IV. ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION
The experimental ^{30}Si profile shown in Fig. 3(b) is accurately described by Eq. (1) (see the solid line). The fitting yields the broadening parameter r=11.4nm and an isotope layer thickness that is consistent with the SIMS analysis of the as-grown bulk structure #1. The broadening reflects a Si self-diffusion coefficient of DSiSD(1000°C)=9.0×10^{−17}cm^{2}/s for the Si nanowire with 400 nm diameter. Annealing of an additional 400 nm SiNW with isotope structure #1 at 1000°C for 4h yields r=20.8nm and thus DSiSD(1000^{°}C)=7.5×10^{−17}cm^{2}/s.
The analysis of the APT reconstruction data for a 70 nm diameter SiNW with isotope structure #2 is displayed in Fig. 4(b). Fitting Eq. (1) to the ^{30}Si concentration profile suggests diffusion coefficients for the interfacial broadening and isotope layer thicknesses that increase with increasing depth. Since the layer ordering and the thickness are well known from SIMS measurements of the bulk isotope structure #2, the seemingly increasing layer thicknesses and the associated interfacial broadening are reconstruction artifacts. The fault in the reconstruction is obvious when the APT profile is compared to the SIMS profile of the as-grown isotope structure #2 [see symbols and the dashed line in Fig. 4(b)]. The fault in the depth calibration of the APT data was corrected with a linear depth dependent scaling factor. The scaling factor is adjusted to fit the layer thicknesses of the as-grown bulk structure #2 determined by SIMS. The result of this recalibration is shown in Fig. 5. After calibration, the ^{30}Si profile obtained from the APT analysis of the 70 nm SiNW (see green full circles in Fig. 5) is similar to the SIMS profile of the bulk isotope structure #2 annealed simultaneously with the SiNW sample (see open circles). Fitting Eq. (1) to the ^{30}Si profile of the APT analysis (see the green line in Fig. 5) reveals a mean broadening for the four interfaces of r¯=(3.9±0.2)nm, which corresponds to a self-diffusion coefficient of DSiSD(850^{°}C)=(2.2±0.5)×10^{−19}cm^{2}/s. On the other hand, the analysis of the diffusional broadening of the ^{30}Si profile obtained from the SIMS analysis of the simultaneously annealed bulk isotope structure #2 (see open circles) yields DSiSD(850^{°}C)=(2.4±0.4)×10^{−19}cm^{2}/s (see the black line Fig. 5). Table I summarizes the self-diffusion data determined in this work. The Si self-diffusion coefficient obtained for the 70 nm diameter SiNW equals, within experimental accuracy, the self-diffusion in the bulk structure #2. Figure 6 shows the temperature dependence of self-diffusion for bulk samples reported in the literature (see squares and the solid line) [11,18]. The data determined in this work for self-diffusion in SiNWs are added for comparison. The cross and circle symbols represent the self-diffusion coefficients in the 400 and 70 nm SiNWs, respectively. It is evident that self-diffusion in SiNWs follows the Arrhenius-type temperature dependence of self-diffusion for bulk Si.
The Si self-diffusion coefficient DSiSD in bulk single crystals is composed of a contribution of vacancies (V) and self-interstitials (I) (see, e.g., Ref [36])
The first (second) term considers the contribution of V (I) to self-diffusion. f_{V,I},CV,Ieq, and D_{V,I} are the diffusion correlation factors, the thermal equilibrium concentrations in atomic fractions (unitless), and the diffusion coefficients of V and I, respectively. The close agreement between Si self-diffusion in bulk and nanosized single crystals indicates that the equilibrium concentrations CV,Ieq remain unchanged in crystals with diameters down to 70 nm, as it is considered to be unlikely that the individual contributions of V and I to self-diffusion and their individual properties CV,Ieq and D_{V,I} are altered by downscaling, leaving the total self-diffusion coefficient given by Eq. (2) unchanged. The close interrelation between Si self-diffusion and the diffusion of some metal atoms such as, e.g., gold, platinum, and zinc in Si (see, e.g., Ref [37]) demonstrates that V and I are formed as Schottky defects rather than as Frenkel pairs [38]. Accordingly, V and I are generated independently due to the finite crystal size. V and I can even exist in various charge states as evidenced by the impact of doping on Si self-diffusion [4], i.e., the formation of charged V and I and thus their concentration in thermal equilibrium is affected by the position of the Fermi-level. The identical diffusion behavior of self-atoms in bulk and nanosized structures proved by their equal self-diffusion coefficients indicates electronic surface states of the samples that are independent of the surface-to-volume ratio and not affected by the nanofabrication process.
Schulze et_al [30] studied the 2 D-distribution of active dopants in Si nanowire-based tunnel field effect transistors (TFETs) with diameters down to 100 nm. They report a diameter dependent distribution of electrically active arsenic (As) within the nanowire that was measured by means of SSRM. The formation of inactive As-vacancy complexes for active dopant concentrations below 10^{18} cm^{–} [3] is suggested as a possible explanation. The inactive complexes are considered to form during subsequent annealing steps by defect reactions between the n-type dopant As and native point defects introduced by an implantation of the top part of the nanowire. Assuming that the presence of interfaces/surfaces of the nanowire mainly acts as an efficient sink for I, an excess of V is considered to give rise to the formation of inactive As-vacancy complexes [30]. At first sight, the results reported by Schulze et_al [30] on the electrical carrier redistribution in nanowires and on self-diffusion in nanosized structures described in this work seem contradictory. However, the experiments described by Schulze et_al concern the redistribution of dopants during the annealing of native point defects introduced in excess by implantation, whereas the self-diffusion treated in this work is mediated by native point defects in thermal equilibrium. In the latter case, information about the annihilation behavior of V and I at surfaces is hardly obtained. Thus, a direct comparison of both results is not meaningful. Finally, the observation of Schulze et_al [30] could also be explained without dopant deactivation and, accordingly, without assuming an imbalance between V and I in the nanowire established by a disparity in surface annihilation. The excess native point defects introduced by implantation are also increasingly reduced by the increased proximity of surfaces for smaller nanowires that act as sinks for both V and I. As a consequence, the transient diffusion of As in the nanostructure decreases with decreasing nanowire diameter. This explanation does not require the presence of inactive As-vacancy complexes, whose preferred formation at low compared to high dopant concentrations is rather unlikely. Overall, additional experimental studies are required to unravel the physical phenomena associated with nanosized semiconductor structures.
V. CONCLUSIONS
Experiments on Si self-diffusion in nanosized crystals with diameters of 400 and 70 nm were performed at 1000 and 850 ∘C, respectively, utilizing isotopically controlled nanowires. The nanowires were fabricated from a Si wafer with a top MBE grown isotope multilayer stack using a nanosphere lithography process in combination with cryogenic reactive ion etching. Atom probe tomography (APT) was applied to determine the three-dimensional distribution of the Si isotopes before and after diffusion annealing. In addition, time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) served to determine the Si isotope depth profiles of as-grown and simultaneously annealed bulk samples. Comparison of the isotope layer thickness determined by APT and SIMS helped to correct for APT reconstruction artifacts. The self-diffusion in nanosized Si is found to be equal to self-diffusion in bulk crystals. This indicates equal thermal equilibrium concentrations of Schottky vacancies and self-interstitials in nano- and bulk-crystals and thus surface states that are independent of the surface-to-volume ratio.
