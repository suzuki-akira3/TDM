Theoretical analyses for an alkali laser pumped by a pulsed light source
Diode-pumped alkali lasers (DPALs) have drawn much attention since they were proposed in 2001. Until now, most theoretical studies have related to the DPALs pumped by a continuous wave or a square-wave light source, but the theoretical reports for a DPAL pumped by a pulsed source still keep rare. In this study, the authors set up a kinetic model for a pulsed DPAL with the high energy transition and ionization processes taken into account. The spontaneous emission that coupled with the lasing mode is theoretically analyzed in the simulation. Additionally, the authors improve the algorithm to simulate the averaged laser intensity in time domain. Our theoretical results and experimental data in two published literatures coincide with each other and the correctness of our kinetic model can be demonstrated. The study should be useful for the design of an efficient pulse-pumped DPAL.
I. INTRODUCTION
Diode-pumped alkali lasers (DPALs) have gained rapid development during the past decade [1–4]. As a novel type of hybrid laser, a DPAL retains the advantages of both gas lasers (GLs) and diode-pumped solid-state lasers (DPSSLs) but evade their demerits in the meantime. Compared with a chemical GL, a DPAL employs nontoxic alkali vapor instead of using noxious materials. Compared with the troublesome thermal management of a DPSSL, the thermal problem of a DPAL is relatively easy to solve by moving generated heat with a flowing procedure [5–7]. What is more, converting the pump light into a coherent output laser should be quick and efficient for a DPAL due to its high quantum efficiency (95.3% for cesium, 98.1% for rubidium, and 99.6% for potassium) [8] and large optical cross section [9]. All these merits make a DPAL become one of the most promising candidates for high-powered lasers [10,11].
The high conversion efficiency of the DPAL pumped by a continuous wave (CW) or a square-wave light source has been demonstrated by numerous experimental studies [12–15]. Zhdanov et_al have achieved the slope efficiency as high as 81% for a Cs laser [16]. Zweiback et_al have realized the average power of 145 W of a rubidium laser by employing a 1.28 kW diode pump source [17]. Russian researchers reported the output power of a Cs laser close to 1 kW in 2012 [18]. Recently, Pitz et_al have achieved an output power of 1.5 kW of a potassium laser, which is the world record of DPALs [19]. On the other hand, a DPAL pumped by the pulsed source is thought to be more controllable than a CW DPAL because of the slighter thermal effect. Additionally, an output laser with relative high peak power could be easily obtained by employing a pulsed source. Only a few experimental studies have utilized the pulsed pump source to investigate the DPAL performance at high pump intensity till now [20–22]. With respect to the theoretical studies, most models are developed for CW DPALs but only two models focus on pulsed DPALs to the best of our knowledge, in which Zweiback et_al only considered the single frequency pumping [23] and Zameroski et_al expanded the theoretical model to the broadband pump sources [20]. Furthermore, two such models ignore the deleterious items of a DPAL, which will reduce the total number densities of the alkali atoms involved in the pumping and lasing processes and affect the laser output features, especially when high-powered diodes are used as the pump source [24–26].
In this study, we develop a simulation model to describe the laser kinetics and output features of a DPAL pumped by a pulsed source. Compared with the models in the other published papers, our theoretical model has the following improvements:
1. The rate equations in Refs [20] and  [23] are based on a simple three-level system. In our model, we set up a quasi-five-level energy system by taking the high energy transition and ionization processes into account.
2. The pump light is assumed to be a single frequency and centered on the D_{2} transitions in Ref [23]. In our model, the spectral bandwidth of the pump is taken into account.
3. The diameters of both pump and laser beams are assumed to be unchanged inside the vapor cell in Refs [20] and  [23]. Such an assumption might bring about some calculation deviation when the beam quality of a pump or laser beam is bad and the cell length is relatively long. In our model, the transverse variation of both the pump and laser beams accord with the Gaussian profile.
4. In the published model of Ref [20], the laser spot size is assumed to be the same as the pump one. In our model, the waist diameter of the laser beam is not related with that of the pump beam. In accordance, our model improves the computation algorithm of the averaged laser intensity by using the independent laser beam diameter.
5. In Refs [20] and  [23], the mode overlap factor is treated as an adjustable fitting parameter when the numerical results are compared with the experimental data. In our model, such a parameter represents the fraction of a pump light that contributes to lasing and can be calculated according to the real experiment condition [27].
6. In both models of Refs [20] and  [23], the expression of the spontaneous emission (SE) that coupled with the lasing mode is thought to be blurry because the unit of such a term is incorrect. In our model, the expression about this has been theoretically remedied in the rate equations.We also compare the published experimental results in Refs [20] and  [21] to our simulation data. It is shown that our results are in good agreement with the experimental data. The study is thought to be helpful for the design of a feasible pulsed DPAL.
II. THEORETICAL DESCRIPTION OF A DPAL PUMPED BY A PULSED SOURCE
In this section, a kinetic model for a pulsed DPAL with the end-pumped configuration is theoretically developed. Both quenching of the upper levels and a shift in the center wavelength of the D_{2} transition arisen by the buffer gas are considered in the simulation process. The beam quality of a DPAL is also taken into account during the computation of the mode volume. As the laser oscillation strongly depends on SE, we specially investigate the influence of SE on the laser output in our study.
A. Examination of the features of a pulsed DPAL
Figure 1 shows the electronic energy levels of atomic rubidium including the traditional three levels (5^{2}P_{3/2,1/2} and 5^{2}S_{1/2}), the higher excited levels (5^{2}D_{5/2},_{3/2} and 7^{2}S_{1/2}), and the ionized level. The D_{2} and D_{1} lines are, respectively, the pump and laser transitions broadened by buffer gases such as methane or ethane. γ_{32} is the fine-structure mixing rate related to the speed of relaxation from the 5^{2}P_{3/2} state to the 5^{2}P_{1/2} state. A and Q, respectively, represent the spontaneous emission rate and quenching rate, where the spontaneous emission rate of 5^{2}D_{5/2,3/2} and 7^{2}S_{1/2} levels are assumed to be the same value for a simplified calculation in this study. n_{1}(t), n_{2}(t), n_{3}(t), n_{4}(t), and n_{5}(t) represent the time-depended alkali number densities at the 5^{2}S_{1/2} level, 5^{2}P_{1/2} level, 5^{2}P_{3/2} level, the higher excited levels (5^{2}D_{5/2},_{3/2} and 7^{2}S_{1/2}), and the ionized level, respectively.
For mathematical simplicity, we assume that all number densities of the five levels are uniform in geometry inside the vapor cell, the laser pulse is a single frequency, and the laser wavelength is centered on the peak of the D_{1} transition. The model is mainly formulated in terms of the pump-photon absorption rate Γ_{P}(t) and the averaged laser intensity Ψ(t) [28]. Thus, the rate equations that describe the population densities of all the energy levels as well as Ψ(t) in time domain are expressed as follows:
where σ_{21} is the collisionally broadened cross section at laser emission line, σ_{31}(λ) is the spectrally resolved pump-absorption cross section, σ_{photoionization} is the photoionization transverse section, ΔE is the energy gap between the ^{2}P_{3/2} and ^{2}P_{1/2} levels, k_{b} is the Boltzmann constant, T is the cell temperature, TT is the window single-pass transmission efficiency at the lasing wavelength, R_{oc} is the reflectance of the output coupler, L_{g} is the length of the gain medium, t_{RT} is the round-trip time for the laser cavity, n_{0} is the total alkali number density in the cell, Γ_{photoionization} is the transition rate of photoionization, k_{EP2} and k_{EP3} are, respectively, the rate constants of the energy pooling of 5^{2}P_{1/2} and 5^{2}P_{3/2} levels, k_{PI} is the Penning ionization rate coefficient, k_{recombination} is the recombination rate constant, and Φ(t) is the spontaneous emission density coupled with the lasing mode, which will be discussed in Sec. II B, respectively.
The fine-structure mixing rate and the quenching rate are related to the addition of the buffer gas, respectively, as described by
where n_{buffer-gas} represents the number density of the buffer gas inside the cell, σ_{32} and σ_{quenching} are, respectively, the fine-structure mixing cross section and quenching cross section, which are both assumed to keep constant for various temperatures during the computation, and V_{r} is the rms thermally averaged relative velocity between the alkali atom and the buffer gas, respectively.
For an end-pumped DPAL with a double-pass pump structure, as illustrated in Fig. 2, Γ_{P} can be expressed as [29]
where η_{del} is the pump delivery efficiency from the laser diode (LD) pump source to the alkali medium, P_{p}(λ) is the spectrally resolved pump power with a Gaussian distribution profile, R_{p} is the reflectance of the pump light at the rear mirror in the laser cavity, and η_{mode} represents the mode-filling efficiency, which is the fraction of a Gaussian pump light that intercepts the laser mode's cross-sectional area and so contributes to lasing [28]. When the waists of both pump and laser beams locate in the center of a vapor cell, the expression of η_{mode} can be simplified as [30]
where ω_{P} and ω_{L} are respectively the waist radii of the pump and laser beams. V_{L} in Eq. (4) is the mode volume of an alkali laser as expressed by
where z_{1} and z_{2} are the distances from the two side surfaces to the laser beam waist position, ω_{L} is the waist radii of the laser beam, and M^{2} represents the beam propagation factor, respectively.
P_{1}, P_{2}, P_{3}, P_{4}, and P_{laser} shown in Fig. 2 represent the laser powers toward two opposite directions at different locations in the laser cavity. Therefore, we can obtain the averaged laser intensity in the gain cell as follows:
P_{1} and P_{3} can be expressed as functions of the output laser power
Combining Eqs. (7)–(9) together, the output laser power can be expressed by a function of the averaged laser intensity:
B. SE during the laser generation
Spontaneous emission (SE), which is usually neglected in a laser system with a CW output, must be considered during analyses of the output characteristics of a pulsed DPAL because SE acts as a seed for stimulated emission at the onset of laser generation. Here, we introduce the physical expression for Φ(t), which is used for the computation of a time-resolved DPAL.
According to Chang et_al [31], the longitudinal number intensity of seed photons from SE in a laser oscillator yields
where c is the velocity of light, V is the mode volume in the laser cavity, and S is the area at the laser beam waist. Thus, Φ(t) can be expressed as follows:
where t_{c} is the average lifetime of photons in the resonator as given by
where L_{c} is the cavity length and Loss is the resonator loss.
Supposing that the ratio of V_{L}/V can be simplified to the ratio of L_{g}/L_{c}, we can finally obtain the following expression for Φ(t) by combining Eq. (13) with Eq. (12):
Equation (14) represents the contribution of SE to the laser emission and plays an important role in analyses of a pulsed DPAL.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
During the simulation, all populations are assumed to be located at the ^{2}S_{1/2} level prior to the pump irradiation. Therefore, the initial conditions can be described as follows:
By employing a Runge-Kutta approach to solve Eq. (1) with the consideration of the initial conditions in Eq. (15), we are able to evaluate the population distributions and the averaged laser intensity. After that, the time-domain features of the outputted laser can be obtained by using Eq. (10). To test the model, we compare our theoretical results to several published experimental data in Secs. III A–III C.
A. Comparison with the experiment
In this subsection, we first applied our model to take a simulation based on the experiment performed by Zameroski et_al [20] A Ti:Sapphire laser with a temporal profile of Gaussian shape was employed as a pump source. The spot size and M^{2} factor of an alkali vapor laser, which can be used to calculate the laser mode volume, were measured at different pump conditions. For the gain medium of rubidium vapor, the rate constants for energy pooling, Penning ionization, and recombination yield: k_{EP2} = 2.09 × 10^{−10} cm^{3}/s, k_{EP3} = 1.5 × 10^{−9 }cm^{3}/s, k_{PI} = 3.5 × 10^{−8} cm^{3}/s, k_{recombination} = 3 × 10^{−9} × T^{−4.5} cm^{6}/s [32–35]. The other parameters from Ref [20] are used in the calculation: T = 137 °C, L_{g} = 12.7 cm, L_{c} = 32 cm, R_{oc} = 0.23, and R_{p} = 0.99. 500-Torr methane is chosen as the buffer gas in the simulation. η_{mode}, the mode mode-filling efficiency, is obtained according to the transmission profiles of both pump and laser beams instead of a fitting parameter presented in Ref [20]. In addition, we think the assumption in the calculation of Ref [20] might not be appropriate as the laser spot size has been assumed to be the same as the pump one. Then, we directly compute the output energy as a function of the pump energy without deducing the value of η_{mode} from the experimental results. The simulation results are shown in Fig. 3. We can see that the calculated results of ours cannot be distinctly distinguished from the experimental curve at relative low pump levels in Fig. 3. When the pump energy becomes higher, our results are a little larger than the experimental ones. This is mainly due to the local thermal effect and the deleterious kinetic processes at high pump energy.
With respect to another experiment presented in Ref [20], we take the theoretical studies on the output features in time domain of an alkali laser. During the calculation, we assume that the pump pulse exhibits a Gaussian profile. The experimental results and our simulated data are diagrammed in Fig. 4. We can see that the relaxation oscillation, which has been measured in the experiment, can also be observed from the simulation curve. Note that the peak timings corresponding to our results and experimental data are somewhat different. It is because the pump curve used in the simulation is a little different from the real one in time domain.
B. Comparison with the experiment
To make a further validation of our model, we also compared the simulation results for our model with the experimental results reported by Sulham et_al [21] The experiment has examined the performance of an alkali laser at high pump intensity by employing a pulsed Ti:Sapphire laser as the pump source. In the experiment, the vapor cell was filled with 550 Torr of methane as the buffer gas at room temperature. We used the following parameters in the simulation according to the experiment report: T = 117 °C, L_{g} = 12.7 cm, L_{c} = 40 cm, R_{oc} = 0.32, R_{p} = 1, V_{L} = 0.32 cm^{3}, and η_{mode} = 0.56. Both the simulation result and the experimental data are presented in Fig. 5. We can see that the simulation data agree very well with the experimental ones at different pump levels. The deviations between the simulated and experimental data keep less than 8%. Additionally, the slope efficiency of our results is almost the same as the experimental one. Similar to the consequence in Sec. III A, the simulation results for our model are a little larger than the experimental ones, especially for the high pump levels. It can be concluded that our theoretical model is accurate for predicting the output performance of a pulsed DPAL.
C. Influence of the cell temperature on output laser energy
Generally, the cell temperature dominates the number intensity of the alkali atoms. One can certainly deduce that such a factor would greatly affect the output features of the DPAL pumped by a pulsed source. In this subsection, we investigate the output performance of a pulsed alkali laser at different cell temperatures. During the calculation, the following parameters are used according to the experimental conditions reported in Ref [20]: L_{g} = 12.7 cm, L_{c} = 32 cm, R_{oc} = 0.23, M^{2} = 17, ω_{L}_{}= 1.53 μm, and R_{p} = 0.99. It is necessary to point out that Ref [20] only provides the beam quality of the alkali laser at the cell temperature of 137 °C. Thus, both M^{2} and ω_{L} for different cell temperatures are supposed to be unchanged with the numerical values being equal to those at 137 °C in our simulation. Additionally, the number intensity of rubidium atoms is evaluated by the employment of Eq. (16) in this subsection [36]
The computation results are presented in Fig. 6. The calculated results are consistent with the experimental ones. From Fig. 6, we can see that the output energy increases to a maximum value and then falls as the cell temperature rises. The reason of such a phenomenon can be explained as follows. When the cell temperature is low, the alkali number density is small, and the number density of the inverse atoms is not high during the lasing process. Thus, the output energy of an alkali laser is relatively small at low temperatures. However, when the cell temperature becomes too high, the number density of alkali atoms increases to a level with several orders higher than that of a low temperature and the population inversion becomes hard to realize as the pump energy keeps unchanged. As a result, the cell temperature should have an optimal value corresponding to the peak output energy.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
In this study, a kinetic model for a DPAL pumped by a pulsed source is theoretically developed. In the model, SE that coupled with the lasing mode, which acts as a seed for stimulated emission, is theoretically analyzed. Additionally, the high energy transition and ionization processes, which might become serious when the peak intensity of the pump is extremely high, are also taken into account during the simulation. The calculated power will become a little larger if these processes are ignored. To confirm the validity of our model, we used our model to undertake the simulation for comparing with some experimental studies. The comparisons illustrate that the results of our model agree well with the experimental ones. As our data are always a little higher than the experimental ones, the computation results are thought to be reasonable and acceptable.
