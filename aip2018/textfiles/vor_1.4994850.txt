Impact of Ba to Si deposition rate ratios during molecular beam epitaxy on carrier concentration and spectral response of BaSi_{2} epitaxial films
Undoped 0.5-μm-thick BaSi_{2} epitaxial films were grown on Si(111) substrates with various ratios of the Ba deposition rate to the Si deposition rate (R_{Ba}/R_{Si}) ranging from 1.0 to 5.1, and their electrical and optical properties were characterized. The photoresponse spectra drastically changed as a function of R_{Ba}/R_{Si}, and the quantum efficiency reached a maximum at R_{Ba}/R_{Si} = 2.2. Hall measurements and capacitance versus voltage measurements revealed that the electron concentration drastically decreased as R_{Ba}/R_{Si} approached 2.2, and the BaSi_{2} films with R_{Ba}/R_{Si}= 2.0, 2.2, and 2.6 exhibited p-type conductivity. The lowest hole concentration of approximately 1 × 10^{15} cm^{−3} was obtained for the BaSi_{2} grown with R_{Ba}/R_{Si} = 2.2, which is the lowest value ever reported. First-principles calculations suggest that Si vacancies give rise to localized states within the bandgap of BaSi_{2} and therefore degrade the minority-carrier properties.
I. INTRODUCTION
Recently, Kaneka Corporation has achieved the conversion efficiency (η) exceeding 26% in a heterojunction back-contact-type crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cell. This broke the old record for η of 25.6% and brings η closer to the performance limit determined by the Si bandgap EgSi of 1.1 eV [1,2]. To develop improvements in η with lower cost, many researchers have paid much attention to Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)_{2}, CdTe, and perovskite solar cells. However, these materials contain non-abundant and/or toxic elements [3–7]. Silicon thin-film solar cells have been studied extensively [8–13]; but with this material, it is not easy to attain a high η as large as 20%. Thus, exploring alternative materials for thin-film solar cells is very important. Among such materials, we have been studying semiconducting barium disilicide (BaSi_{2}) [14], which consists of the safe and earth-abundant elements, Ba and Si, and possesses a bandgap of 1.3 eV that is appropriate for a single-junction solar cell [15]. In addition, BaSi_{2} has a large absorption coefficient of 3 × 10^{4} cm^{−1} at 1.5 eV, which is more than 40 times larger than that of c-Si [15–18]. In addition, undoped BaSi_{2} exhibits a large minority-carrier diffusion length of 10 μm and a large minority-carrier lifetime of 10 μs [19–22]. Both electron and hole concentrations can be controlled in a wide range up to the order of 10^{19} cm^{−3} by doping Sb and B, respectively [23,24]. Recently, we attained an η value approaching 10% in p-BaSi_{2}/n-Si heterojunction solar cells [25–27]. Other types of solar cells such as Schottky-type BaSi_{2}, BaSi_{2} nanowires, BaSi_{2}/perovskite stacked layers, and back-contacted BaSi_{2} have also been proposed [28–31]. To further improve the η of BaSi_{2} solar cells and to achieve homojunction solar cells, it is important to fabricate high-quality BaSi_{2} epitaxial films.
In past works, we employed molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) to co-deposit Ba and Si on heated Si(111) substrates for the BaSi_{2} growth [32,33]. Because the vapor pressure of Ba is much higher than that of Si, we grew these BaSi_{2} films under a Ba-rich condition where, for example, the ratio of the Ba deposition rate to the Si deposition rate (R_{Ba}/R_{Si}) was fixed at 3.0 [33]. These BaSi_{2} films exhibit an n-type conductivity with an electron concentration n in the range from 5 × 10^{15} to 2 × 10^{16} cm^{−3} [34–36]. Regarding GaAs MBE growth, the density of the electron trap states located 0.82 eV from the conduction band edge increases with the As/Ga flux ratio [37]. This is because the Ga vacancies, As antisites, and interstitial As in the GaAs films work as electron traps. Therefore, we anticipate that the value of R_{Ba}/R_{Si} will have a huge impact on the characteristics of BaSi_{2} films in the same way as the As/Ga flux ratio does. According to Kumar et_al [38], the supercell approach based on first-principles density functional theory (DFT) revealed that the formation energies of point defects in BaSi_{2} such as Si vacancies (V_{Si}), Ba antisites (Ba_{Si}), and interstitial Si (Si_{i}) are dependent upon the growth conditions. Hence, the amount of point defects and their species in BaSi_{2} may change with R_{Ba}/R_{Si}. The purpose of this research is to fabricate undoped BaSi_{2} epitaxial films with various values of R_{Ba}/R_{Si} and to examine the influence of R_{Ba}/R_{Si} on the crystalline qualities and the electrical and optical properties. Kumar et_al also found out that Si vacancies are most likely to occur in BaSi_{2} [38]. Thus, we also aim to reveal the influence of Si vacancies on the density of states (DOS) and total energies in the orthorhombic unit cell of BaSi_{2}.
II. METHODS
A. Formation of BaSi_{2} films and characterizations
An ion-pumped MBE system (R-DEC) with a base pressure better than 10^{−8 }Pa and equipped with a Knudsen cell for Ba and an electron-beam evaporation source for Si was used for sample preparation. The values of R_{Ba} and R_{Si} were controlled using an electron impact emission spectroscopy (EIES, INFICON) feedback system. We used low-resistivity n-Si(111) (resistivity ρ = 0.01 Ω cm) substrates for the photoresponsivity measurement to make the contribution of photogenerated carriers in the Si substrate to the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) negligibly small. In contrast, we employed high-resistivity p-Si(111) (ρ = 1000–10 000 Ω cm) for the Hall measurement, assuming that the undoped BaSi_{2} exhibits n-type conductivity. Before growth, substrates were first cleaned according to standard RCA (Radio Corporation of America) procedure, followed by thermal cleaning at 900 °C for 30 min in the ultra-high vacuum chamber to remove a protective oxide layer on the surface. We then deposited Ba on a Si substrate heated at 500 °C by reactive deposition epitaxy to form a 3-nm-thick BaSi_{2} template layer [39]. This template functions as a seed crystal source for the subsequent layer. Next, we grew 0.5-μm-thick undoped BaSi_{2} on the templates at 580 °C by MBE. During the MBE growth, the R_{Si} was fixed at 0.9 nm/min and the R_{Ba} was varied from 0.9 to 4.6 nm/min, meaning that the R_{Ba}/R_{Si} varied from 1.0 to 5.1. We then formed a 3-nm-thick amorphous Si at 180 °C, which acts as a surface passivation layer for assuring a good electrical contact [22,27,40]. Finally, 80-nm-thick indium-tin-oxide (ITO) electrodes with 1 mm diameter were sputtered on the front surface and 150-nm-thick Al electrodes on the back surface of the Si substrate for the optical property evaluation. As described later, the IQE reached a maximum at R_{Ba}/R_{Si} = 2.2. To check the IQE spectra, we also grew one sample possessing an undoped BaSi_{2} absorber as thick as 1.0 μm, with which the photocurrent density (J_{L}) beyond 40 mA/cm^{2} was simulated in a BaSi_{2} solar cell in Ref [30].
The crystalline qualities of grown films were characterized by reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) along the Si[112¯] azimuth, and with x-ray diffraction (XRD; RIGAKU Smart Lab) using Cu Kα radiation, where Ge(220) single crystals were used to make the x-ray monochromatic. We measured θ-2θ XRD patterns to confirm the a-axis orientation of BaSi_{2}. We also conducted ω-scan x-ray rocking curve measurement to obtain full width at half maximum (FWHM) of a BaSi_{2}(600) diffraction intensity to represent its crystalline quality. The actual atomic ratio of Ba to Si, N_{Ba}/N_{Si}, of the films was measured by Rutherford backscattering (RBS) spectrometry, where the incident He ion energy was set at 1.6 MeV and the backscattered ions with a scattering angle of 150° were detected. Photoresponse and reflectance spectra were evaluated at room temperature using a lock-in technique with a xenon lamp and a 25-cm-focal-length single monochromator (Bunko Keiki SM-1700A and RU-60N). The light intensity was calibrated using a pyroelectric sensor (Melles Griot 13PEM001/J). The carrier concentration of BaSi_{2} was measured by Hall measurements using the van der Pauw method with an applied magnetic field of 0.8 T. We also measured the capacitance versus voltage (C-V) characteristics to estimate the carrier concentration in BaSi_{2} [35,36] at the condition when the carrier concentration decreased down to the order of 10^{15} cm^{−3}, and hence, the carriers flowing through the Si substrate was not negligible in the Hall measurement. For this purpose, we fabricated 0.5-μm-thick undoped BaSi_{2} on medium-doped p-Si(111) (ρ = 0.1 Ω cm). The hole concentration p of this substrate was 2 × 10^{17} cm^{−3}.
B. Computational details
The crystal structure of orthorhombic BaSi_{2} is shown in Fig. 1. The stoichiometric description of the unit cell is Ba_{8}Si_{16}. In each BaSi_{2} unit cell, there are two crystallographically inequivalent sites for Ba (Ba^{(1)} and Ba^{(2)}) and three inequivalent sites for Si (Si^{(3)}, Si^{(4)}, and Si^{(5)}). Therefore, the atoms are distributed over 4Ba^{(1)}, 4Ba^{(2)}, 4Si^{(3)}, 4Si^{(4)}, and 8Si^{(5)}. Total energies of BaSi_{2} with three kinds of V_{Si} and DOSs were calculated using the Vienna ab initio simulation package code [41] based on DFT with the projector-augmented wave pseudopotential [42] and Perdew-Wang generalized gradient approximation method [43]. Total energy minimization was obtained via optimization of the lattice parameters and relaxation of the atomic positions in a conjugate gradient routine. Using an energy cutoff of 600 eV and a 6 × 8 × 4 grid of Monkhorst–Pack points, the convergence in the total energy was better than 1 meV/atom [44]. Hereafter, we describe BaSi_{2} with one V_{Si} as Ba_{8}Si_{15}V_{Si(3)}, in which one of the four Si^{(3)} sites is vacant, Ba_{8}Si_{15}V_{Si(4)}, in which one of the four Si^{(4)} sites is missing, or Ba_{8}Si_{15}V_{Si(5)}, in which one of the eight Si^{(5)} sites is vacant. The calculated total energies of these compounds are summarized in Table I. In our framework of first-principles calculations, we cannot take into account thermal effects at the finite temperature to the DFT calculation.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Experimental results
Figure 2 shows the RHEED patterns observed along the Si[112¯] azimuth and the θ-2θ XRD patterns for BaSi_{2} films formed with different values of R_{Ba}/R_{Si}. As shown in Fig. 2, sharp streaky RHEED patterns and intense a-axis-oriented diffraction peaks in the XRD patterns can be observed. These results show that a-axis-oriented BaSi_{2} epitaxial films were grown on the Si(111) substrate, regardless of the R_{Ba}/R_{Si}.
Figure 3 presents the R_{Ba}/R_{Si} dependences of BaSi_{2} growth rate and FWHM values obtained from an ω-scan x-ray rocking curve using a BaSi_{2}(600) diffraction intensity. The BaSi_{2} growth rate monotonically increases as the R_{Ba} increases. The FWHM value decreases with increasing R_{Ba}/R_{Si} and reaches a minimum at R_{Ba}/R_{Si} ∼ 3, and increases with R_{Ba}/R_{Si}. This result suggests that the R_{Ba}/R_{Si} should be around 3 from the view point of crystalline quality of BaSi_{2}. That is why we have chosen the R_{Ba}/R_{Si} value at 3.0 for the MBE growth of BaSi_{2} films [33].
Figure 4(a) shows the RBS spectra and Fig. 4(b) presents the resultant N_{Ba}/N_{Si} depth profiles for BaSi_{2} films with R_{Ba}/R_{Si} = 1.0, 2.2, and 4.0. The N_{Ba}/N_{Si} > 0.5 means that Ba was in excess of stoichiometric conditions, while N_{Ba}/N_{Si} < 0.5 indicates that the Ba amount was deficient. The N_{Ba}/N_{Si} value in the sample with R_{Ba}/R_{Si} = 4.0 was greater than that with R_{Ba}/R_{Si} = 2.2 along the entire depth. Similarly, the N_{Ba}/N_{Si} value in the sample with R_{Ba}/R_{Si} = 2.2 was greater than that with R_{Ba}/R_{Si} = 1.0. Thus, we assume that the amount of point defects and their species in BaSi_{2} of these three samples are different. In addition, the N_{Ba}/N_{Si} decreased when it approached the BaSi_{2}/Si interface for all the samples even though they were grown under a constant value of R_{Ba}/R_{Si} during the growth. This result suggests that the Si substrate supplied Si atoms to the BaSi_{2} layer during the MBE growth.
The photoresponse spectra of the samples are shown in Fig. 5(a). A bias voltage V_{bias} = –1 V was applied to the front-surface ITO electrode with respect to the back-surface Al electrode to extract the photogenerated holes in the BaSi_{2} film. To our surprise, the photoresponse spectra were quite sensitive to variations in R_{Ba}/R_{Si}. To clarify the impact of the spectral response, we converted them to the values of IQE and subsequently to the photocurrent density J_{L} using
where q is the elemental charge and Φ_{AM1.5G} is the photon flux density of AM1.5G. As shown in Fig. 5(b), the J_{L} reached a maximum at R_{Ba}/R_{Si} = 2.2. Figure 5(c) shows the IQE spectra of the 1.0-μm-thick BaSi_{2} film grown with R_{Ba}/R_{Si} = 2.0 at V_{bias} = 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 V. For this sample, we chose the R_{Ba}/R_{Si} value at 2.0 instead of 2.2. This is because the N_{Ba}/N_{Si} may exceed 0.5 in the region close to the surface for R_{Ba}/R_{Si} = 2.2 when the BaSi_{2} thickness increases from 500 nm to 1 μm, leading to the degradation of the photoresponse properties. The IQE exceeds 80% in a wide wavelength range at V_{bais} = 0.5 V, demonstrating the great potential of BaSi_{2} homojunction solar cells. In the present work, the photogenerated carriers in BaSi_{2}, where the electric field exists because of V_{bias}, are collected by drifting. The IQE is proportional to the ratio of the carrier lifetime to the carrier transit time. With increasing V_{bias}, the drift velocity of carriers increases, leading to a decrease in the carrier transit time. Therefore, more holes and electrons can reach the ITO electrode and the n-Si region before recombination, respectively. When the transit time becomes much shorter than the carrier lifetime, the IQE may exceed 100% as shown in the case of V_{bias} = 0.5 V. This phenomenon has been applied to practical devices such as photoconductors.
We next measured the carrier concentration of each sample and examined the correlation between the photoresponsivity and the carrier concentration. Figure 6(a) shows the relationship between R_{Ba}/R_{Si} and carrier concentration as evaluated by Hall measurements and/or C-V measurements. For this purpose, we have fabricated eight samples with R_{Ba}/R_{Si} = 1.0, 1.7, 2.0, 2.2, 2.6, 3.0, 3.5, and 4.0. Among them, the carrier type of the BaSi_{2} films grown with R_{Ba}/R_{Si} = 2.0, 2.2, and 2.6 was p. Other samples showed n-type conductivity, and the electron concentration increases for both increasing and decreasing R_{Ba}/R_{Si} values. The hole concentration reached a minimum of approximately 1 × 10^{15} cm^{−3} at R_{Ba}/R_{Si} = 2.2. This small majority carrier concentration may reduce the carrier recombination of photogenerated minority carriers (electrons) with majority carriers (holes) and hence leads to an enhanced minority-carrier lifetime and, consequently, gives rise to large spectral response and J_{L}, as shown in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b). Regarding the BaSi_{2} film with R_{Ba}/R_{Si}= 2.0–2.6, we estimated the carrier concentration by the C-V method because the carrier concentration decreased so much. Figure 6(b) shows an example of the 1/C^{2} versus V plot for the sample with R_{Ba}/R_{Si} = 2.2. The current density versus voltage plot is also shown. The current density increased when the negative bias voltage was applied to the ITO electrode with respect to the p-Si substrate. The carrier type by the Hall measurement was found to be holes. The built-in voltage V_{D} was approximately 0.80 V, and this value corresponds to the difference in the Fermi level between BaSi_{2} (EFBaSi_{2}) and Si (EFSi) before contact. In our previous report [35,36], the V_{D} value was 1.5 V for n-BaSi_{2} (n = 2 × 10^{16} cm^{−3}) formed with R_{Ba}/R_{Si} = 3.0 on the same p-Si substrate (p = 2 × 10^{17} cm^{−3}). Here, we evaluate the position of EFBaSi_{2} for BaSi_{2} with R_{Ba}/R_{Si} = 2.2. The electron affinity of BaSi_{2} and Si is qχ_{BaSi2} = 3.2 eV (Ref [45]) and qχ_{Si} = 4.05 eV, respectively, and their bandgaps are EgBaSi_{2} = 1.3 eV and EgSi = 1.1 eV. Thus, the valence band offset ΔE_{V} is given by qχ_{Si}+EgSi−(qχ_{BaSi2}+EgBaSi_{2})=0.65eV. Assuming that the effective density of states at the valence band of Si, NVSi, is 1.04 × 10^{19} cm^{−3}, the EFSi is located at k_{B}Tln(NVSi/p) = 0.10 eV from the valence-band edge of Si, where k_{B} is the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute temperature. Therefore, the EFBaSi_{2} is positioned at around 0.25 eV (=0.80 + 0.10–0.65) above the valence band edge of BaSi_{2}, EVBaSi_{2}, suggesting that the BaSi_{2} exhibits p-type conductivity. Therefore, the hole concentration of the BaSi_{2} film with R_{Ba}/R_{Si} = 2.2 is thus estimated to be approximately 1 × 10^{15} cm^{−3} using
Here, the effective density of states at the valence band of BaSi_{2}, NVBaSi_{2}, is approximately 2.0 × 10^{19} cm^{−3} from the principle-axis components of the effective mass tensor for holes and two equivalent valleys at EVBaSi_{2} [16]. The obtained hole concentration is also explained by the slope of the 1/C^{2} versus V plot. According to Kumar et_al [38], V_{Si}, Ba_{Si}, and Si_{i} are predominant defects in BaSi_{2}. We expect that these point defects form during the MBE growth when the R_{Ba}/R_{Si} is deviated from the ideal value and that they work as donor impurities. The conduction type changed from n-type to p-type in the BaSi_{2} films grown with R_{Ba}/R_{Si} = 2.0–2.6 when the density of Si vacancies which act as donors became smaller than the residual hole concentration, likely owing to B atoms. This is because the optimum value of R_{Ba}/R_{Si} minimizes Si vacancies. It is reported that p-type doping due to B contamination is routinely detected in Si MBE when using standard MBE cleaning schemes [46,47]. The influence of the wet chemical precleaning as well as of the in situ thermal cleaning in the ultra-high vacuum was investigated with respect to this effect [46]. We cannot detect such a small B concentration of the order of 10^{15} cm^{−3} by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), which is much smaller than the SIMS detection limit of B in BaSi_{2}.
B. Calculation results
To elucidate what happens in Ba_{8}Si_{15}V_{Si(3)}, Ba_{8}Si_{15}V_{Si(4)}, and Ba_{8}Si_{15}V_{Si(5)}, we discuss here their total DOSs and energies. The binding energy of Ba_{8}Si_{16} was calculated to be −133.696 eV. The total energy of Ba_{8}Si_{15}V_{Si(3)}, for example, is calculated to be (–127.174) + (−5.417) =−132.591 eV. In the same way, the total energies of Ba_{8}Si_{15}V_{Si(4)} and Ba_{8}Si_{15}V_{Si(5)} were calculated as summarized in Table I. From an energetic point of view, Ba_{8}Si_{15}V_{Si(3)} is most likely to form, implying that the V_{Si} is most likely to be located at the Si^{(3)} sites. It should be noted that Ba_{8}Si_{15}V_{Si(4)} is also energetically favorable because of a small energy difference between Ba_{8}Si_{15}V_{Si(3)} and Ba_{8}Si_{15}V_{Si(4)}. Figure 7 shows the total DOSs of (a) Ba_{8}Si_{16}, (b) Ba_{8}Si_{15}V_{Si(3)}, (c) Ba_{8}Si_{15}V_{Si(4)}, and (d) Ba_{8}Si_{15}V_{Si(5)} near the Fermi level, E_{F}. The energy zero of the DOS curve is taken at their E_{F}. There are localized states within the bandgap as shown in Figs. 7(b)–7(d). These results suggest that the deviation from stoichiometry promotes recombination of electron-hole pairs via localized states and therefore leads to the degradation in IQE. In Fig. 7(c), the E_{F} is positioned closer to the conduction band edge, suggesting that Ba_{8}Si_{15}V_{Si(4)} is an n-type semiconductor. We speculate that that is why the electron concentration increased in Fig. 6(a) with R_{Ba}/R_{Si} being away from the optimum value of around 2.2. The present calculation results show that it is very important to satisfy stoichiometry in a BaSi_{2} absorber by controlling R_{Ba}/R_{Si} precisely. This is, however, not consistent with the fact that the BaSi_{2} film with R_{Ba}/R_{Si} = 2.2 (N_{Ba}/N_{Si} < 0.5) was optimum as shown in Fig. 4(b). We think that excess Si atoms are precipitated in the form of Si microcrystallites as discussed below. Figure 8 shows the Raman spectrum of a 0.5-μm-thick a-axis-oriented BaSi_{2} epitaxial film grown with R_{Ba}/R_{Si} = 2.0, measured at room temperature by NRS-5100 (RIGAKU Smart Lab) using a frequency doubled Nd:YAG laser (532 nm). The Raman lines originate from Si tetrahedra with T_{h} symmetry in the lattice of BaSi_{2}. The transverse optical phonon line of Si (Si_{TO}) was observed even in such a thick BaSi_{2} film. Considering that the absorption coefficient of BaSi_{2} at this wavelength is α = 3 × 10^{5} cm^{−1} [15], and hence the penetration depth of the laser light was limited to around 1/α × 3 ∼0.1 μm, the Si_{TO} signal is considered to originate from Si precipitates in the BaSi_{2} film. Similar Si_{TO} signals were detected in BaSi_{2} (Ref [48]) and β-FeSi_{2} films [49] by Raman spectroscopy, and they were ascribed to the Si precipitates in the films.
IV. SUMMARY
We fabricated 0.5-μm-thick undoped BaSi_{2} epitaxial films on Si(111) substrates with various values of R_{Ba}/R_{Si} ranging from 1.0 to 5.1 and characterized their electrical and optical properties. The RBS measurement revealed that the N_{Ba}/N_{Si} value decreased close to the BaSi_{2}/Si interface. This was attributed to the Si atoms diffused from the Si substrate during the MBE growth. The photoresponsivity drastically changed as the R_{Ba}/R_{Si} was varied, and the J_{L} reached a maximum at R_{Ba}/R_{Si} = 2.2. As a result of the Hall and C-V measurements, it was found that the electron concentration decreased when R_{Ba}/R_{Si} approached the optimum value, and the BaSi_{2} films grown with R_{Ba}/R_{Si} = 2.0, 2.2, and 2.6 exhibited p-type conductivity. The lowest hole concentration of approximately 1 × 10^{15} cm^{−3} ever reported was obtained at R_{Ba}/R_{Si} = 2.2. First-principles calculations by VASP predicted that BaSi_{2} containing Si vacancies induce localized states within the bandgap. Therefore, it is very important to control R_{Ba}/R_{Si} precisely to improve the BaSi_{2} solar cell performance because various disorders or defects are sensitive to R_{Ba}/R_{Si}.
