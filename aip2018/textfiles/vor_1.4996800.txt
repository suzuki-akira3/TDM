Low-temperature oxide-free silicon and germanium wafer bonding based on a sputtered amorphous Ge
We report a potential low-cost method for low-temperature silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge) wafer bonding based on an intermediate amorphous Ge (a-Ge). The sputtered a-Ge is demonstrated to be extremely flat (RMS = ∼0.28 nm) and hydrophilic (contact angle = ∼3°). The a-Ge turns to be the polycrystalline phase at the Si/Ge/Si bonded interface, whereas it fully turns to be single-crystal phase at the Ge/Ge/Si bonded interface after annealing. The simulated stress distribution reveals that the maximum thermal stress in a-Ge dominates the crystallization process and the crystalline phase of the intermediate Ge layer depends on the induction of seed crystals. More importantly, the threading dislocation and oxide layer are not observed at the bonded interface. This finding may be applied to fabricate high-performance Si-based Ge photoelectric devices.
The wafer bonding technique has been considered to be a promising candidate for microelectronics, sensor electronics, and micromechanics [1–3]. The Si/Si direct bonding (no surface treatment) has been investigated by Toyoda and Tong et_al [4–6] Although a high surface energy of ∼2.1 J/m^{2} was achieved, the annealing temperature was higher than 700 °C. On the other hand, Refs [7–9] reported the Ge/Si direct wafer bonding (no surface treatment) by the wet method; similarly, high-temperature annealing (880 °C) was used. The creak and the threading dislocations (TDs) were observed at the bonded interface. This direct bonding method without surface treatment is unacceptable for the CMOS process.
Recently, some work has been done to decrease the annealing temperature of Si/Si and Ge/Si wafer bonding, such as plasma treatment [10–16] and high-vacuum activation [17–19]. O_{2} and N_{2} plasmas were used to achieve low-temperature Si/Si [10] and Ge/Si [11] wafer bonding due to the fact that the plasma can produce highly hydrophilic and reactive surfaces. However, it also suggested that thin Si oxide (∼4.8 nm) and Ge oxide (∼2 nm) may appear at Si/Si and Ge/Si bonded interfaces, respectively, after annealing. In addition, Ref [20] also reported a hydrophobic bonding of the Si nanomembrane and Ge substrate at low temperature. However, a 1.2 nm thick amorphous region induced by the high twist, tilt, and misfit disorientation exists at the bonded interface. This may deteriorate the carrier transport at the bonded interface. The surface activation method can obtain clean and activated surfaces in high vacuum (10^{−7 }Pa) [17,18]. Therefore, high bonding strength and an oxide-free bonded interface can be achieved for Si/Si bonding at room temperature. Unfortunately, a thin 3–5 nm amorphous Si (a-Si) appears at the bonded interface due to the surface damage formed by high-energy Ar atoms. Hence, high-temperature annealing (700 °C for 2 h) should be conducted for the recrystallization of a-Si. Tong et_al introduced a 1 μm thick sputtered a-Si as the intermediate layer between the Si wafers [21,22]. Although the bonding strength of the wafer pairs can reach the fracture strength of bulk Si, the a-Si layer still exists at the bonding interface after annealing at 450 °C for 24 h. To date, the study of crystalline oxide-free Si/Si and Ge/Si wafer bonding at low temperature has not been done adequately. How to lower the thermal budget and achieve a high-quality bonded interface are still two important questions.
In this paper, we introduce an amorphous Ge (a-Ge) intermediate layer between Si and Ge wafers innovatively. The oxide-free Si/Ge/Si and Ge/Ge/Si bonded interfaces are achieved at low temperature. Different crystallization models are proposed for the polycrystalline Ge (poly-Ge) at the Si/Ge/Si bonded interface and the single-crystal Ge (c-Ge) at the Ge/Ge/Si bonded interface after annealing.
The (001)-oriented n-Si substrates (∼5 Ω cm, 1 × 2 cm) and p-Ge (∼0.05 Ω cm, 1 × 2 cm) substrates were cleaned using the standard RCA process and organic solutions, respectively. Then, the wafers were immersed into the HF solution (HF:H_{2}O = 1:20) to remove the surface oxide. After that, a thin a-Ge layer was sputtered using a DC-magnetron sputtering system. The contact angle of the a-Ge film was measured immediately after a-Ge layer growth. For wafer bonding, the sputtered Ge and Si wafers were brought into contact with each other in the air immediately when they were taken out of the chamber. After contact, the bonding strength is very low due to the weak van der Waals force between the wafers (-OH groups). For enhancing the bonding strength, the wafers were annealed in the N_{2} atmosphere at 350 °C for 10 h. No pressure was applied on the wafers during annealing. The bonded wafers were further annealed at 400 °C for 10 h to trigger the full crystallization of a-Ge. Before the annealing of Ge/Ge/Si wafer pairs, the Ge substrate was thinned to ∼20 μm to avoid wafer separation due to high thermal stress.
The a-Ge morphology was examined ex situ by atomic force microscopy (AFM). A Dataphysics DSA100 device was used to obtain the contact angle. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to obtain surface signals of a-Ge. The bonded interface was identified by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The bubbles at the bonded interface were examined by C-mode scanning acoustic microscopy (CSAM) with a frequency of 250 MHz for Ge/Ge/Si wafer pairs and 230 MHz for Si/Ge/Si wafer pairs.
Figure 1 shows the RMS of the a-Ge layer versus input power and operation pressure. The RMS shows little change at lower power (3–120 W) and suddenly increases when the input power exceeds 120 W. It suggests that higher input power provides higher energy for sputtered Ge atoms to hit the Si substrate. Fortunately, the a-Ge layer on Si and Ge substrates is examined to be ∼0.28 [Fig. 1(a)] and ∼0.46 nm [Fig. 1(b)], respectively, when the power is below 120 W. In addition, the RMS also shows little change at low pressure; nevertheless, it suddenly increases when the pressure exceeds 0.4 Pa. This is attributed to the fact that the voltage between the target and wafers decreases with the increase in the pressure; the sputtered atoms cannot obtain enough energy to migrate to a suitable place on substrates.
The contact angle of Si and Ge wafers after chemical cleaning is 83.7° and 29.5°, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2(a). With the increase in the a-Ge thickness, the contact angles of the two wafers decrease sharply in the range of 0–2 nm at first and then stabilize around 3°. In addition, as shown in the inset of Fig. 2(a), the contact angle shows little change with input power. This proposes that when the Ge atoms are deposited, the a-Ge film is formed gradually. Once the a-Ge film is fully established (∼2 nm), the whole a-Ge surface is hydrophilic.
We also investigate the effect of exposure time (t_{e}) on the contact angle [Fig. 2(b)]. With the increase in t_{e}, the contact angle drastically increases at first and then approaches a plateau. The XPS examination of the exposed a-Ge layer was conducted to explain this feature, as shown in the inset of Fig. 2(b). Except two Ge 3d peaks located at ∼29 eV [23], a Ge oxide peak is observed at ∼31 eV. This oxide is identified to be Ge-O (534 eV) and Ge-O-Ge (532 eV) [24], as shown in the O 1s peak. In addition, an obvious peak is observed in the C 1s peak. We suggest that the deposited a-Ge is fresh and reactive in the chamber. When it is taken out of the chamber, its surface is easy to be oxidized and the organic contaminants are also easy to adsorb on its surface. This leads to the increase in the contact angle.
After the study of surface characteristics of a-Ge, the sputtered Ge and Si wafers were brought into contact with each other and bonded in the furnace and the bubbles at the bonded interface were evaluated by CSAM, as shown in Fig. 3. One can see that very few bubbles exist at the bonded interface. This is attributed to the short t_{e} of the a-Ge layer and the absorption of the H_{2} bubble by the intermediate Ge layer. It is known that the formation of the H_{2} bubbles is given by Ge-OH + OH-Ge → Ge-O-Ge + H_{2}O and Ge + 2H_{2}O → GeO_{2} + 2H_{2}. The shorter the t_{e} of a-Ge layer in the air, the less the -OH groups absorbed on the a-Ge layer. As a result, less bubbles generate at the interface.
The SEM images of the bonded interfaces are presented in Fig. 4. It is observed that for Si/Ge/Si wafer bonding, an ∼90 nm thick intermediate Ge layer is uniformly sandwiched between two Si wafers. The bonding strength of Si/Ge/Si wafers after annealing at 400 °C is measured to be 15.94 MPa. This is close to the fracture strength of bulk Si. For Ge/Ge/Si wafer bonding, the Ge/Ge/Si bonded interface is also uniform, and no gap or creak can be observed at the interface. The bonding strength of 4.41 MPa is achieved for the Ge/Ge/Si sample. The fracture position is located at the Ge substrate. This indicates that the bonding strength at the bonded interface is larger than that of bulk Ge. Note that the bonding strength of Si/Ge/Si and Ge/Ge/Si samples after contact is only 0.11 and 0.15 MPa, respectively, and that after annealing at 350 °C for 10 h is 3.64 and 2.43 MPa, respectively. This suggests that the annealing is beneficial to the increase in the bonding strength. It is surprising that we cannot distinguish the intermediate 60 nm thick Ge layer by SEM. We speculate that the phase of the a-Ge at the Ge/Ge/Si interface has been changed. This feature will be verified by the following transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images.
The crystallinity of the intermediate a-Ge after annealing at 400 °C was clarified by TEM. For Si/Ge/Si bonding, a 90 nm thick Ge layer is uniformly located at the bonded interface [Fig. 5(a)]. It is surprising that the oxide layer is not observed at the Ge/Ge bonded interface, as shown in Figs. 5(b) and 5(k). In addition, the Ge crystalline grains are also observed in the middle of the intermediate Ge layer [Fig. 5(c)]. However, the intermediate Ge layer still shows the amorphous phase at the a-Ge/Si interface [Fig. 5(d)]. This suggests that the crystallization of a-Ge starts from the a-Ge/a-Ge interface. The diffraction pattern of the Si/Ge/Si interface shown in Fig. 5(i) also verifies that most of the intermediate Ge after annealing becomes poly-Ge. We will explain the reason in the following.
For Ge/Ge/Si bonding, the oxide layer is also absent at the Ge/Ge interface, as shown in Figs. 5(e), 5(g), and 5(l). Note that the 60 nm thick a-Ge becomes c-Ge and no TD is observed in the bonded Ge substrate, as shown in Figs. 5(g), 5(h), and 5(j). It suggests that although the chemical reaction takes place at the Ge/Ge interface at 350 °C, the Ge atoms also start to migrate to form a dense Ge film and they conduct a redistribution during annealing at 400 °C. Moreover, the crystallization of a-Ge at 400 °C also triggers Ge atoms to redistribute at the Ge/Ge interface. Therefore, the oxide layer disappears.
In order to clarify the crystallization process of a-Ge in Si/Ge/Si and Ge/Ge/Si wafer bonding, we simulate the stress distribution in bonded wafers at 400 °C. For Si/Ge/Si bonding [Fig. 6(a)], the compressive stress mainly distributes in the a-Ge layer. The maximum of the stress appears at the middle of the a-Ge layer [inset of Fig. 6(a)]. Similarly, the stress in Ge/Ge/Si bonded wafers also mainly distributes in the a-Ge layer due to the largest coefficient of thermal expansion of a-Ge (a-Ge [25]: 7.9 × 10^{−6 }K^{−1}, Ge [26]: 5.5 × 10^{−6 }K^{−1}, and Si [26]: 2.6 × 10^{−6 }K^{−1}). The maximum stress is located at the a-Ge/Ge interface. This is very different from that in Si/Ge/Si bonding. The yellow layer in Fig. 6 means the diffusion layer at the Ge/Si interface after annealing. We propose two stress-driven crystallization models for Si/Ge/Si and Ge/Ge/Si wafer bonding, as shown in the inset of Fig. 6. For Si/Ge/Si bonding, the crystallization of the a-Ge layer starts from the a-Ge/a-Ge interface due to the greatest thermal stress at the a-Ge/a-Ge interface. Then, the crystallization sprawls along the vertical direction. Due to the absence of the seed crystal, the total a-Ge turns to be poly-Ge finally. However, for Ge/Ge/Si bonding, the maximum stress triggers the crystallization of a-Ge at the a-Ge/Ge interface and the a-Ge turns to be c-Ge due to the induction of the c-Ge substrate.
Low-temperature Si/Ge/Si and Ge/Ge/Si wafer bonding based on a hydrophilic and flat a-Ge layer are achieved. High bonding strength is achieved for Si/Ge/Si (15.95 MPa) and Ge/Ge/Si (4.41 MPa) wafers after annealing at 400 °C. The a-Ge layer starts to crystallize from the a-Ge/a-Ge interface (poly-Ge) for Si/Ge/Si bonding and starts to crystallize from the a-Ge/Ge interface (c-Ge) for Ge/Ge/Si bonding. The maximum thermal stress located at a-Ge/a-Ge and a-Ge/Ge interfaces and the induction of the Ge seed crystal can be responsible for this feature. The oxide-free Ge/Ge/Si and Si/Ge/Si bonded interfaces result from the atom redistribution at the Ge/Ge interface.
