A reducible Weil representation of sp(4) realized by differential operators in the space of smooth functions on H^{2}×S^{1}
This work presents a novel way to obtain the associated Romanovski functions R_{n,m}(x) with n ≥ m in the three separate regions in terms of n and m. We obtain the raising and lowering relations with respect to the both indices, simultaneously, in the three regions. Then, a reducible Weil representation of the real Lie algebra sp(4) is realized in the space of complex-valued smooth functions on H^{2} × S^{1} by differential forms for the Cartan-Weyl basis. Its invariant subspace is the second rare instance of the highest weight irreducible representation of sp(4) all whose weight spaces are one-dimensional.
I. INTRODUCTION
The ground field used throughout this article is R, and we use the notations sl(2) and sp(4) instead of the noncompact algebras sl(2,R) and sp(4,R), respectively. However, we emphasize that the functions for the representation spaces are complex-valued numbers. Explicit realizations of sp(4)-modules have many applications in fields such as the classification of shell model states in the dynamical symmetry of some collective models of nuclear structure [1–5], the mapping methods [6] for simplifying initial problem Hamiltonians [7], the complete classification of yrast-band energies in even-even nuclei [8], vector coherent state representations in regard to the nuclear collective model of quadrupole vibrations and rotations [9–12], the pairing correlations in nuclei [13,14], and quantum optics [15]. The basis vectors for the irreducible unitary representations of sp(4) have been constructed by means of the boson operators in Ref [16]. Later, the boson realization was extended to the Lie algebra sp(2n) with n as an arbitrary integer number [17] (for the boson realization of sp(4k), see also Ref [18]). The matrix and generating kernel formulations for the boson realization of sp(4) have been considered in Refs [19–21]. The authors of Ref [2] have shown that, in the Fock space H_{F} constructed as the module over the Heisenberg Lie algebra h≔h(2n) with generators a^{+}=(a1+,…,an+) and a = (a_{1}, …, a_{n}), there are two non-equivalent Weil representations for symplectic algebras sp(4k) with k as a positive integer number. The second and zero degree monomials in the creation and annihilation operators as some elements of the universal enveloping algebra U(h) span the trivial central extension of the Lie algebra sp(2n) with respect to the bracket. Thus, the representation of h in the Fock space H_{F}≔R[a^{+}] naturally generates the representation of the Lie algebra sp(2n) of outer derivations of h in the same space. The authors of Ref [2] have proven that this representation for sp(4k) is reducible and decomposes into the direct sum of irreducible Weil representations, H_{F}=H_{+}⊕H_{−} (for Weil representations of symplectic groups, see Refs [22–24] and also Sec. 12.3 of Ref [25]).
The Romanovski polynomials were first introduced by the English mathematician Sir Routh [26] in 1884 and then successfully used as probability distribution functions by the Russian mathematician Romanovski in 1929 [27]. It is known that the (associated) Jacobi differential equation is transformed to the (associated) Romanovski one when the variable is rescaled by the unit imaginary number [28]. For this reason, the solutions of the associated Romanovski functions are usually presented by the associated Jacobi functions whose argument is a multiplier of unit imaginary number. The associated Romanovski functions as independent real ones are less known, however. In Ref [29], the associated Legendre functions (as a special case of the associated Jacobi ones) have been used to obtain the irreducible unitary Weil representation H_{+} of sp(4) realized in the space of smooth functions on S^{2} × S^{1}. This work obtains the Weil representation H_{+} of sp(4) realized in the space of smooth functions on H^{2} × S^{1} by means of the associated Romanovski functions. This representation, which itself is the highest weight irreducible one of sp(4) with the one-dimensional weight spaces, is embedded in a reducible representation of sp(4).
II. LADDERING RELATIONS FOR THE ASSOCIATED ROMANOVSKI FUNCTIONS R_{n,m}(x) WITH n≥m
Let us first consider the second-order linear differential equation for the associated Romanovski functions R_{n,m}(x) with n ≥ m and x∈−∞,+∞ as
Its solutions for (i) n ≥ 0 and −n ≤ m ≤ n as well as (ii) n ≤ −1 and m ≤ n in terms of the Rodriguez formula are given by
in which a_{n,m}s are arbitrary coefficients. The shape invariance symmetries of differential equation (2.1) for the solutions in region (i) have already been considered and used as a base stone for deriving supersymmetry and parasupersymmetry properties in some quantum solvable models [28,30–37]. In Fig. 1, the functions (2.2) have been shown as two infinite triangular regions (i) and (ii). Since Eq. (2.1) is altered when m is replaced by −m, it is expected that R_{n,m}(x) will be linearly proportional to R_{n,−m}(x) in region (i). The coefficients a_{n,m} will be determined by the realization of the laddering relations obtained from the shape invariance with respect to the parameters n and m. Note that the expression (2.2) becomes zero for the infinite triangular region n ≥ 0 and m < −n, and thus we have still not determined the solutions of (2.1) for region (iii) of Fig. 1.
For a given m (n), we can factorize the associated differential equation (2.1) in the form of shape invariance equations with respect to the parameter n (m),
where
Regarding the shape invariance Eqs. (2.3) and (2.4), the raising and lowering relations of the indices n and m can be obtained for the associated Romanovski functions R_{n,m}(x) as
The choice of the factors in the right-hand sides of Eqs. (2.7) and (2.8) is arbitrary and must only give us the shape invariance relations. It is clear that the realization of the shape invariance Eqs. (2.3) and (2.4) do not impose any conditions on the coefficients a_{n,m}, but the realization of the laddering relations (2.7) and (2.8) impose recurrence relations on these coefficients with respect to n and m, respectively.
Lemma 1. For a given m, the laddering relations (2.7) of the index n, as well as for a given n, the laddering relations (2.8) of the index m are simultaneously established in region (i) if the coefficients a_{n,m}for n ≥ 0 and −n ≤ m ≤ n are chosen as
where α is an arbitrary constant.
Proof. It is easy to obtain a coefficient of the highest power of x in the following form for the associated Romanovski functions R_{n,m}(x) in region (i) using the Rodriguez formula (2.2):
Using the last relation in the first relations of (2.7) and (2.8) as well as comparing the coefficients of the highest power of x, x^{n}, the following recursion relations are obtained:
Repeated application of the recursion relations (2.11) and (2.12) for given values of m and n, respectively, leads to
The first and the second relations of (2.13) correspond to m ≥ 0 and m ≤ 0, respectively. Take note that, the combination of Eqs. (2.13) and (2.14) with each other gives us the following results:
These complete the proof of (2.9). □
Lemma 2. For a given m, the laddering relations (2.7) of the index n, as well as for a given n, the laddering relations (2.8) of the index m are simultaneously established in region (ii) if the coefficients a_{n,m}for n ≤ −1 and m ≤ n are chosen as
where β is an arbitrary constant.
Proof. Rodriguez formula (2.2) for the associated Romanovski functions R_{n,m}(x) in region (ii) gives
Substituting the expansion formula (2.18) into the first relations of (2.7) and (2.8), we again get recursion relations the same as (2.11) and (2.12) in region (ii) with the following solutions:
If we equate the last two results, we find
This completes the proof of (2.17).□
Lemma 3. (a) Region (iii) involves new and independent solutions for the differential equation (2.1) as given below,
They satisfy the raising and lowering relations (2.7) and (2.8), simultaneously. (b) For a given m ≤ −1, the connection between the associated Romanovski functions R_{−1,m}(x) and R_{−m,m}(x) is established by
if α = 2β. This causes the raising relation of index n given in (2.7) to be held for all values of n from m to the positive infinity.
Proof. (a) First, one must note that the Rodriguez formula (2.2) vanishes in region (iii). The definition (2.22) leads automatically to the realization of the first relation of (2.7) for m ≤ −1, m < −n ≤ 0. The second relation of (2.7) can be proved by induction on n. Therefore, the shape invariance symmetry Eq. (2.3) on the index n holds in region (iii). This guarantees that new functions defined in (2.22) not only are solutions of differential equation (2.1) but also satisfy the raising and lowering relations of the index m as (2.8). (b) Substituting the expansion formula for R_{−1,m}(x) from (2.18) into (2.23), we get
If we put a_{−1,m} and a_{−m,m} from Lemmas 1 and 2 into (2.24), then we get the condition α = 2β. □We must emphasize that α = 2β is the condition for matching of the solutions of regions (i) and (ii) by the raising and lowering relations of the indices n and m. It must also be mentioned that in Fig. 1, the value of α has been set to 1.
Corollary 1. According to the laddering relations (2.7) and (2.8), the associated Romanovski functions R_{n,m}(x) of region (ii) can be transformed to those of region (iii) and vice versa. Also, the associated Romanovski functions R_{n,m}(x) of region (iii) can be mapped to those of region (i), while vice versa is not possible. Consequently, the functions R_{n,m}(x) of region (i) cannot transform to the functions of region (ii) by the ladder operators, too.For n ≤ −1 and m ≤ n, the associated Romanovski functions satisfy two different types of orthogonality relations as
One can follow the proof of these relations in Ref [37] using the coefficients a_{n,m} fixed by (2.17). Furthermore, in the case n ≥ 0 and −n ≤ m ≤ n, the associated Romanovski functions satisfy the following integral relations:
where
In Eqs. (2.27) and (2.28), the parameter j is an integer or a half-integer number greater than or equal to n + 1 and n+n^{′}2+1, respectively. The proof of these relations is started by the binomial expansion of the expressions as (1+x2){n} in the associated Romanovski functions, together by using the coefficients a_{n,m} fixed by (2.9). At the end of this section, we point out that the associated Romanovski functions in the infinite triangular region n ≥ 0 and m < −n have no explicit forms that we can use for obtaining integral relations.
III. REDUCIBLE AND IRREDUCIBLE sl(2)-SUBMODULES OF H_{+}
Let us define the following bases for smooth functions on H^{2} × S^{1}:
in which Znm(θ,ψ)=e^{inψ}2πR_{n,m}(tanθ)’s are non-spherical angular functions [35] of the coordinates −π2≤θ≤π2 and 0 ≤ ψ < 2π on the hyperbolic plane H^{2} = SU(1, 1)/U(1). 0 ≤ ϕ < 2π denotes the coordinate of the circle S^{1}. Let H_{+}≔Lin.spann,m{n≥m} where n and m are integer numbers. The space H_{+} can be split into the direct sums of the sl(2)-submodules in four different ways as given below,
The symbol [.] denotes the integer part. In Fig. 2, we have schematically shown all bases of the space H_{+} as the points n,m with the n ≥ m limitation in the flat plane with n and m as the horizontal and vertical axes, respectively. In what follows, by using (2.7) and (2.8), we show that the subspaces H_{n,}, H_{,m}, Hk+, and Hk− are, respectively, modules of the horizontal, vertical, right diagonal, and left diagonal sl(2)-subalgebras of sp(4), presented in Sec. IV.
Proposition 1. Let
The differential operators J_{+0}, J_{−0}, and J_{30}span a copy of sl(2),
Each of the infinite-dimensional submodulesH_{,m}realizes a representation of the vertical algebra sl(2),
The submoduleH_{,m}with m ≤ −1 is reducible sinceH_{,m}≔Lin.spann,m{n≥−m}is an invariant nontrivial subspace. The invariant subspaceH_{,m}is infinite-dimensional and its complement is (2|m|)-dimensional.
Proposition 2. Let
The differential operators J_{0+}, J_{0−}, and J_{03}span a copy of sl(2),
Each of the infinite-dimensional submodulesH_{n,}realizes a representation of the horizontal algebra sl(2),
The submoduleH_{n,}with n ≥ 0 is reducible sinceH_{n,}≔Lin.spann,m{−n≤m≤n}is an invariant nontrivial subspace. The invariant subspaceH_{n,}is (2n + 1)-dimensional and its complement is infinite-dimensional.
Proposition 3. Set
These operators span a copy of sl(2),
Each of the infinite-dimensional submodulesHk+,where k is an arbitrary nonnegative integer, realizes a reducible representation of the right diagonal algebra sl(2),
The submoduleHk+is reducible sinceHk+≔Lin.spann,n−k{n≥k+12}is an infinite-dimensional invariant nontrivial subspace.
Proposition 4. Set
These operators span a copy of sl(2),
Each of the infinite-dimensional submodulesHk−,where k is an arbitrary integer, realizes an irreducible representation of the left diagonal algebra sl(2),
The orthogonality relations (2.25) and (2.26) lead us to define two different types of scalar products on the subspace ⊕n=−∞−1H_{n,} of H_{+} as shown below (bar denotes the complex conjugation),
Note that J_{30} (J_{03}) is a self-adjoint operator, and the operators J_{+0} and J_{−0} (J_{0+} and J_{0−}) are the Hermitian conjugate of each other with respect to the scalar product (3.20) and (3.21). Therefore, the infinite subspace ⊕n=−∞−1H_{n,} realizes unitary reducible representations of the vertical and horizontal algebras of sl(2). Considering the definitions in (3.12) and (3.16), one can conclude that the subspace ⊕n=−∞−1H_{n,} is a non-unitary reducible representation for both the right and left diagonal algebras of sl(2), with respect to any of the scalar products (3.20) and (3.21). Also, we use the integral relations (2.27) and (2.28) to define the following integral relations on the infinite subspace ⊕k=0+∞Hk−(=⊕n=0+∞H_{n,}) of H_{+}:
with j as an integer or a half-integer number greater than or equal to n+n^{′}2+1. Therefore, the parameter j cannot be fixed to a certain value to deal with an appropriate given measure to define a scalar product on the infinite subspace ⊕k=0+∞Hk−. Although, for a given j, bases of the finite subspace ⊕n=0j−1H_{n,} are orthogonal, but it is understood that the operators J_{+0} and J_{−0} as well as J_{0+} and J_{0−} are not the Hermitian conjugate of each other with respect to (3.22).
IV. THE WEIL REPRESENTATIONS H_{+} AND H_{+} OF THE LIE ALGEBRA sp(4)
Let us first point out that there are the following nonzero commutation relations in addition to the commutation relations introduced in Sec. III:
which are represented on the module H_{+}. Then, we briefly recall the root system and the Cartan-Weyl basis for sp(4). The starting point is the triangular decomposition sp(4) = g^{+} ⊕ h ⊕ g^{−} with respect to the Cartan subalgebra h. g^{+} and g^{−} denote eigenspaces of the operators belonging to adh corresponding to positive and negative roots, respectively. The Dynkin diagram of this rank-two Lie algebra is . Therefore, there are only two simple roots, say α_{1} and α_{2}, and we may set them such that |α_{2}|/|α_{1}|=2 and α_{1},α_{2}^=3π/4. So, the Dynkin diagram determines the Cartan matrix as A=2−2−12(see, e.g., Refs [38–43]). It means
From the two last relations of (4.2), we find that the α_{1}-chain through α_{2} and the α_{2}-chain through α_{1} involve the positive roots α_{2}, α_{2} + α_{1}, and α_{2} + 2α_{1} as well as α_{1} and α_{1} + α_{2}, respectively. Then, for sp(4), there exist four positive roots: Δ_{+} = {α_{1}, α_{2}, α_{1} + α_{2}, 2α_{1} + α_{2}}. Therefore, based on the triangular decomposition, the Lie algebra sp(4) involves the ten Cartan-Weyl generators as H_{α1},H_{α2},E_{α1},E_{α2},E_{α1+α2},E_{2α1+α2},F_{α1},F_{α2},F_{α1+α2} and F_{2α1+α2}. Finally, the root vectors of sp(4) are depicted by the following diagram:
Now, we set bases in the horizontal, vertical, left diagonal, and right diagonal copies of sl(2) as given below,
Lie subalgebra g^{+} (g^{−}) is generated by E_{α1} and E_{α2} (F_{α1} and F_{α2}). The lowest and highest weights of irreducible sl(2)-submodules are contained in the following.
Corollary 2. The subspacesH_{,m}(whether m ≥ 0 or m < 0) andH_{n,} (n < 0) are the irreducible highest weight modules of sl(2) with the highest weights −2|m|− 1 and 2n, respectively. The subspaceH_{n,}with n ≥ 0 is a finite-dimensional irreducible module of sl(2) with the highest and lowest weights 2n and −2n, respectively. The subspacesH2j+andH2j− (H2j+1+andH2j+1−) are the irreducible highest weight modules of sl(2) with the highest weight−12 (−32).Reducible and irreducible modules of sp(4) are contained in the following.
Corollary 3. H_{+}is a reducible module of sp(4) withH_{+}≔Lin.spann,m|n≥0,−n≤m≤nas an invariant nontrivial subspace. The weight of the base vectorn,mof the irreducible representationH_{+}with respect toH_{α1}andH_{α2}is equal to(2m,−m−n−12). So, the vector0,0of the moduleH_{+}is a highest weight vector with the weight(0,−12). The space of weight vectors inH_{+}is one-dimensional, and this guarantees the irreducibility of theH_{+}-representation based on the theory of Verma modules. So, the representationH_{+}is the irreducible quotient-module of the Verma module M_{(0,−1/2)}.The next proposition collects the main results of this article.
Proposition 5. The ten differential operators J_{+0}, J_{−0}, J_{30}, J_{0+}, J_{0−}, J_{03}, J_{++}, J_{−−}, J_{+−}, and J_{−+}in the spaceH_{+}of smooth functions on H^{2} × S^{1}satisfy the non vanishing commutation relations of the Cartan-Weyl generators of the Lie algebra sp(4) as in Eqs. (3.7), (3.10), (3.12), (3.13), (3.16), (3.17), and (4.1). The generators {J_{30}, J_{03}} constitute the Cartan subalgebra. The sp(4)-submoduleH_{+}is irreducible with the highest weight(0,−12)with respect toH_{α1}≔2J_{03}andH_{α2}≔−(J_{03}+J_{30}). Also, the quadratic Casimir operator,
has the eigenvalue−524on the moduleH_{+}.
V. SUMMARY AND REMARKS
Introducing the associated Romanovski functions in terms of the integer numbers n and m with n ≥ m, we have obtained simultaneously and separately the realization of the laddering equations with respect to each of the integers by means of two pairs of ladder operators. Although, the functions have explicit forms in terms of the Rodriguez formula in both regions (i) n ≥ 0 and −n ≤ m ≤ n as well as (ii) n ≤ −1 and m ≤ n, but they do not have explicit forms in region (iii) n ≥ 0 and m < −n and are derived by the ladder operators shifting indices n and m. We have shown that the associated Romanovski functions of region (i) cannot be transformed by the ladder operators to those in regions (ii) and (iii), although the opposite is possible. This formulation has been used to construct the reducible Weil representation H_{+} of the real Lie algebra sp(4) realized by differential operators in the space of complex-valued smooth functions on H^{2} × S^{1}. Propositions 1 and 2 unite representations of the vertical and horizontal sl(2)-algebras in the spaces of functions on H^{2} × S^{1}. Propositions 3 and 4 show that right diagonal and left diagonal sl(2)-algebras are generated by both vertical and horizontal sl(2)-algebras and are represented in the other spaces of functions on H^{2} × S^{1}. Proposition 5 implies that modules of the vertical, horizontal, right diagonal, and left diagonal sl(2)-algebras constitute the reducible infinite-dimensional space H_{+} for the larger Lie algebra sp(4) with ten independent differential generators. It has also been shown that the Weil representation H_{+} involves an invariant subspace H_{+} which is the second rare example of the highest weight irreducible representation of sp(4) whose weight spaces are one-dimensional. Finally, we point out that just similar to what has been done in Refs [44] and  [45], the idea of this work may be used to construct sl(2)-coherent states associated with the infinite subspaces H_{n,} with n ≤ −1. To construct these coherent states, one must use the horizontal sl(2) algebra and the inner products (3.20) and (3.21). Moreover, the horizontal sl(2) algebra and the finite subspaces H_{n,} (0 ≤ n ≤ j − 1) equipped to the inner product (3.22) may be utilized to make sl(2)-coherent states by an appropriate displacement operator.
