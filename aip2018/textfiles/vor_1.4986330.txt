Numerical study on antiknock measures of concrete gravity dam bearing underwater contact blast loading
A concrete gravity dam (CGD) bearing underwater contact blast loading is important to estimate the explosion resistance of CGD. The blast resistant measure on aluminum foam of CGD is proposed by simulating the CGD subjected to underwater contact blast loading in this paper. Taking full advantages of the Euler and Lagrange methods, the Euler-Lagrange coupled method was used to simulate the above situations. Specifically, the Euler method was adopted to simulate explosive, reservoir water, and air. Meanwhile, the Lagrange method was used to simulate the CGD. The Koyna CGD subjected to underwater contact blast loading was simulated. The rules of crack distributions and dynamic responses of the Koyna CGD were studied to propose the arrangement form of the aluminum foam as the antiknock material and analyze the antiknock performance of that. The results show that aluminum foam, as an antiknock material, could effectively reduce the amplitude of the pressure wave and the dynamic response. It has more advantages of reducing horizontal, vertical, and inclined cracks and weakening the water cut effect.
I. INTRODUCTION
Concrete, by nature as a kind of typical heterogeneous brittle material, has played a tremendous role in the process of global modernization [1]. With the development of the modern water conservancy project, concrete materials are also widely used to build high concrete gravity dams (CGDs) worldwide. In peacetime, a large number of high CGDs are usually planned and constructed to develop water resources for power generation, irrigation, shipping, and tourism. However, high CGDs have suffered enormous threat of explosion incidents on account of terrorist bombing attacks and accidental explosions, which have increased in recent years. Breaching and accidental damage to CGDs, considering their significant political and economic benefits, inevitably cause tremendous casualties and property loss. Therefore, in addition to the research of the seismic problem of the CGDs [2], the destruction of the CGDs when they are subjected to impact loads especially blast loading should also be analyzed.
Explosion is a complex process which includes detonation, high pressure gas expansion, and pressure wave propagation. Some researchers carried out experimental and numerical studies on this problem. In the experimental way, Wang et_al [3] investigated the dynamic response of scaling square reinforced concrete slabs withstanding close-in explosion loadings and proposed two empirical equations to amend the results affected by scaling up from the model to the prototype. Lu et_al [4–6] studied the effect of a strong underwater shock wave on a CGD by hammer impact methods in model tests. This method may be used to approximately forecast the damage of CGD and may also be useful in other engineering applications. In addition, the antiknock performance of the flexible polyurethane foam bearing strong underwater blast shock is discussed to protect the CGDs. Zhang et_al [7] assessed the blast damage to ground surface targets by analyzing the explosion seismic effect. The experimental results showed that this method was available on the condition of a definite distance range and an identical ground-layer state. However, experimental methods need high conditions and cost which limit those development. With the advancement in the computing power, the numerical methods are widely used. A number of researchers by using numerical simulation made a deep research on damage mechanisms of concrete structures subjected to explosion loadings. The precision of numerical simulation mainly depends on the material models, such as concrete constitutive, equation of state (EOS) of explosive, and model algorithm. Numerical simulations can describe the whole process of the explosion and offer researchers more information. In terms of reinforcement concrete slab structures under blast loadings, Lin et_al [8] investigated the dynamics response, discussed the damage mechanism, and compared with experimental tests. Zhao et_al [9,10] and Wang et_al [11] utilized LS–DYNA to simulate the damage mode and response of the reinforced concrete containment structure under internal blast loading. Hu et_al [12] proposed the coupled Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics–finite element method (SPH–FEM) numerical simulator which considered large deformations, damage distribution, and blasting vibration. It helped in the analysis of the blasting response in rock mass with a single numerical mode. Zhang et_al [13] and Liu and Liu [14] applied the SPH method to simulate underwater explosion. Emamzadeh et_al [15], by using a dynamic adaptive finite element procedure, carried out an investigation into the propagation of far field explosion waves in water and their effects on nearby structures. Wang et_al [16] studied the shock wave propagation characteristics and cavitation effects by a coupled Euler-Lagrange numerical approach when underwater explosion is near boundaries. Zhang et_al [17] investigated the explosion resistance and damage mechanism of CGDs bearing blast loading. In the past, research on the numerical modelling of concrete dams withstanding underwater blast loading have made great progress. However, only a few papers put their emphasis on the numerical research about concrete dams bearing underwater blast loading. There are few simulations about the failure mechanism, crack distribution, and antiknock material of CGDs bearing underwater contact blast loading.
In this paper, an investigation into the failure mechanism, crack distribution, and antiknock material of Koyna CGD withstanding underwater contact blast loading was conducted through the method of numerical simulation. The concrete material model Riedel-Hiermaier-Thoma (RHT) proposed by Riedel [18], considering the effects of large strains and high strain rate, is applied in the simulation. The Euler-Lagrange coupled method available in AUTODYN was used to simulate the CGD subjected to underwater contact blast loading. Based on their respective advantages, the Euler method was adopted to simulate explosive, reservoir water, and air, while the Lagrange method was employed to simulate the CGD. The results were analyzed to propose aluminum foam as the antiknock material considering the dynamic responses and characteristics of damage crack distribution. Further numerical simulations are made to discuss the influence of the detonation depth. This study can provide theoretical reference as antiknock safety assessment and protection design of CGDs.
II. MATERIAL PARAMETERS
A. Explosion
The behavior of Trinitrotoluene (TNT) high explosives can be typically described by the Jones–Wilkins–Lee (JWL) equation [19,20] of state (EOS). The JWL EOS can be given by
where P is the pressure of detonation products; E_{d} is the internal energy of every unit volume of TNT; A, B, R_{1}, R_{2}, and ω are the explosion parameters; V is the relative volume. The calculation parameters of explosives, according to the explosive manual, A, B, R_{1}, R_{2}, ω, and E_{d}, are 373.77 MPa, 3.75 MPa, 4.15, 0.9, 0.35, and 8.9 GJ/m^{3}. The internal energy of TNT E_{d} is 8.9 GJ/m^{3}. The density of TNT ρ_{T} = 1630 kg/m^{3}.
B. Air
Air is generally regarded as an ideal gas, which is described by an ideal gas EOS. The relation between pressure and energy can be written as
where C_{0}, C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3}, C_{4}, C_{5}, and C_{6} are the material parameters and E_{a} is the internal energy of every unit volume of air. In this paper, C_{0}, C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3}, and C_{6} are equal to 0; C_{4} = 0.4 and C_{5} = 0.4. The internal energy of air E_{a} is 2.5 MJ/m^{3}. The density of air ρ_{a} is 1.225 kg/m^{3}.
C. Water
The shock EOS is presented to simulate the behavior of water. The pressure is given by
where C_{22}, α, S_{1}, S_{2}, S_{3}, and γ_{0} are the material parameters. E_{W} is the internal energy of every unit volume of water. μ = ρ/ρ_{0} − 1; ρ_{0} and ρ are the density of water in the initial state and the current state, respectively. In this paper, C_{22}, α, S_{1}, S_{2}, S_{3}, and γ_{0} are 1484 m/s, 0, 1.979, 0, 0, and 0.11, respectively. The internal energy of water E_{w} is 3.41 MJ/m^{3}. The density of water in the initial state ρ_{0} is 1000 kg/m^{3}.
D. Concrete
The blast loading is a kind of behavior at a high speed. The dynamic behavior of concrete bearing blast loading is extremely complex, which shows obvious correlation with high strain. To reliably demonstrate concrete dynamic properties under impact loading, the RHT constitutive model, based on work by Riedel et_al [18], is particularly useful for simulating the dynamic behavior of concrete.
The RHT strength surface Y_{residual} is given by
where Y_{c}(p) is the tensile-to-compressive meridian function, R_{3}(θ) is the scalar function of Lode angle θ, and F_{rate} is the function of strain rate ε̇.
The RHT constitutive model, considering the high strain rate, large strain, and the effects of the high pressure at the same time, also takes into account the influence of strain hardening, strain softening, and third invariant. In this paper, the RHT constitutive model in the AUTODYN material library is applied to the dam concrete. The parameters of the RHT constitutive model [21] are shown in Table I.
E. Aluminum foam
Aluminum foam is a new kind of multi-functional material with cavities. It exhibits many physical and mechanical properties, such as energy absorption, cushion, shock absorption, and antiknock, which show good prospects in engineering application. The non-linear elastic constitutive is adopted for aluminum foam [22,23]. The constitutive relation of aluminum foam is shown in Fig. 1. The material parameters of aluminum foam are the density ρ_{f} = 1200 kg/m^{3} and Poisson's ratio μ_{f} = 0.3.
III. SIMULATION OF CGD BEARING UNDERWATER CONTACT BLAST LOADING
A. Description of the numerical model
Based on India's Koyna CGD as the research object, a typical non-overflow dam section is selected to construct the finite element model. As shown in Fig. 2, the height of the dam is 103 m, the normal water level is 93.5 m, and the width of the dam section is 4.5 m. The detonation depth is defined as H. The finite element model shown in Fig. 3 is composed of TNT explosive charge, reservoir water, CGD, and air. Air, explosive, and water are simulated using an Euler method, while CGD is modeled using the Lagrange method, as shown in Fig. 3. The interaction of fluid and solid is modeled by the full coupled Euler-Lagrange method. The mass of each explosive used is 203.75 kg. The material parameters in the numerical model are shown in Table I. There are two measure points distributed at dam crest and the downstream slope fold as shown in Fig. 4.
The outflow boundary condition is defined at the outer surface of air and water to simulate the infinite field of air and water. Two sections of the dam are applied transmit boundary conditions to make shock waves without reflection. The full-constraint is applied on the bottom of the dam. The first-order natural period of the dam is 0.326 s.
B. The dynamic results of Koyna CGD bearing underwater contact blast loading
Aiming to study dynamic responses and crack distribution of Koyna CGD subjected to underwater contact blast loading, the explosive charge is located at the upstream face (H = 27 m) which is the height corresponding to that of the downstream slope. The time-history analysis of pressure is performed. The contours of pressure and crack distribution are also given.
Figure 5 displays the pressure-time history curves of point 1 and point 2 of the CGD. As shown in Fig. 8, the pressures of point 1 and point 2 show sharp fluctuations at 0.012 s, which is far less than the natural period of the dam. This shows that the impulse damage is the main damage form, which in most of the damage region is concentrated near the explosive.
Figure 6 displays the crack evolution course of the dam subjected to underwater contact blast loading. As shown in Fig. 6, when t = 5 ms, the upstream face of dam shows some shallow cracks. A blasting crater (mainly due to compressive failure) is formed in the center of the explosive position. In the process of stress wave propagation, in which time is from 5 ms to 15 ms, there are many shallow cracks and radial cracks (mainly due to shear failure) on the upstream face of the CGD. When the stress waves reach the downstream slope, tensile waves are formed by reflection. With tensile wave propagation in the dam, the vertical cracks (mainly due to tensile failure) are obviously formed from downstream to upstream. When time is 15 ms–20 ms, the pressure wave in water arrives at the interface of water and air and makes the water cut effects, which leads to the inclined cracks (mainly due to shear failure) of CGD in the upstream region. The movement of the top of CGD to the upstream face, shown in Fig. 6, leads to horizontal cracks (mainly due to tensile failure) in the downstream region. The crack distribution map in t = 30 ms shows that the cracks located at the dam crest and the downstream fold slope have been completely penetrated and remain stable.
IV. SIMULATION OF THE DYNAMIC RESPONSE OF CGD USING ALUMINUM FOAM AS EARTHQUAKE RESISTANT MEASURE
A. Description of earthquake resistant measure by aluminum foam
The present study aims to analyze the antiknock performance of the dam using aluminum foam as an antiknock material. From the results of Fig. 6, it is found that both the upstream and downstream faces of CGD crack easily. Thus, considering the antiknock properties of aluminum foam, there is a 0.4 m thick antiknock material laid in the upstream and downstream face of CGD, as shown in Fig. 7.
B. Results and discussion
The crack distributions between no-aluminum foam and aluminum foam as antiknock materials are presented in Fig. 8. Figure 8 shows that the vertical cracks disappear from downstream to upstream. Horizontal cracks and inclined cracks decrease significantly. Moreover, the craters with aluminum foam as an antiknock material are smaller than those without aluminum foam. Figure 8 illustrates that aluminum foam as an antiknock material can effectively reduce the tensile, shear, and compressive stress of CGD and weaken the water cut effect, especially for upstream and downstream faces of CGD. Aluminum foam as an antiknock material should be laid in both the upstream and downstream faces of CGD.
C. The influence of the explosive location on the crack distribution
For the purpose of investigating the influence of the explosive location on crack distribution and antiknock performance of the dam, five explosive charges are arranged at the upstream face of the dam. H is set from 7 m to 87 m, spacing 20 m, as shown in Fig. 9.
Figure 10 shows the crack distribution of the dam of different detonation depths. Figure 10(a) presents the results of no-aluminum foam as an antiknock material. When H is 7 m, serious damage cracks can be found in the dam head. The upstream face of the dam demonstrates a large area of shallow cracks. At the interface of water and air, serious damage cracks of the dam due to water cut effects are also found. When H is 27 m–47 m, the area of damage cracks is bigger with the increase in the detonation depth. When H is 47 m, two main radial cracks almost throughout the whole dam are found, as well as many horizontal and vertical cracks. The expanding cracks of the dam gradually evolve into the penetrated cracks and sprawl into the whole dam. At the same time, the area and the depth of damage cracks reach the maximum. As the detonation depth continuously increases, when H is 67 m–87 m, the cracks range gradually reduces. The character of crack distribution is mainly shallow cracks and some vertical cracks. The main damage crack area of the dam heel is more serious as with the increase in the detonation depth. The reason for this phenomenon is probably that extremely large water pressure and explosive pressure apply at the bottom of the dam. Figure 10(b) presents the results of aluminum foam as an antiknock material. After using aluminum foam as an antiknock material, the area and the depth of cracks are obviously reduced. When H is 7 m–27 m, the cracks of the dam head mainly include shallow cracks and two radial cracks. When H is 47 m–87 m, the deeper the detonation depth, the smaller the damage crack range. With the increase in the detonation depth, the water cut effect reduces. Besides, it is quite obvious that aluminum foam as an antiknock material can narrow the area and depth of cracks, particularly horizontal and vertical cracks. But it is weak in the inhibition of radial cracks.
V. CONCLUSIONS
The non-linear dynamic finite element analysis software AUTODYN is employed to study the dynamic responses and damage crack distribution of the CGD subjected to underwater contact blast loading. Aluminum foam, a new antiknock material, is also considered to conduct antiknock studies of the dam. From the above results of numerical simulation, the conclusions are drawn as follows:
(a) The impulse damage is the main damage form for CGD. A blasting crater (mainly due to compressive failure) is mainly in the center of the explosive position. Shallow cracks and radial cracks (mainly due to shear failure) are mainly on the upstream face of the CGD. The vertical cracks (mainly due to tensile failure) are mainly near the downstream region. The water cut effects lead to the inclined cracks (mainly due to shear failure) of CGD in the upstream region. The movement of the top of CGD to the upstream face leads to horizontal cracks (mainly due to tensile failure) in the downstream region.
(b) The aluminum foam as an antiknock material can effectively reduce the tensile, shear, and compressive stress of CGD and weaken the water cut effect, especially for upstream and downstream faces of CGD. Aluminum foam as an antiknock material should be laid in both the upstream and downstream faces of CGD.
(c) With the increase in the detonation depth, the water cut effect reduces and the regions of damage cracks of CGD first become larger and then become smaller. Meanwhile, the aluminum foam as an antiknock material has a better anti-knock effect with the increase in the detonation depth.
