Lateral movements in Rayleigh–Taylor instabilities due to frontiers. Numerical analysis
Numerical simulations were performed for Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) hydrodynamic instabilities when a frontier is present. The frontier formed by the interface between two fluids prevents the free movement of the fingers created by the instability. As a consequence, transversal movements at the rear of the fingers are observed in this area. These movements produce collapse of the fingers (two or more fingers join in one finger) or oscillations in the case that there is no collapse. The transversal velocity of the fingers, the amplitude of the oscillations, and the wave number of the RT instabilities as a function of the Rayleigh number (Ra) were studied near the frontier. We verified numerically that in classical RT instabilities, without a frontier, these lateral movements do not occur; only with a physical frontier, the transversal displacements of the fingers appear. The transverse displacement velocity and the initial wave number increase with Ra. This leads to the collapse of the fingers, diminishing the wave number of the instabilities at the interface. Instead, no significant changes in the amplitude of the oscillations are observed modifying Ra. The numerical results are independent of the type or origin of the frontier (gas-liquid, liquid-liquid, or solid-liquid). The numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental results reported by Binda et_al [Chaos 28, 013107 (2018)]. Based on these results, it was possible to determine the cause of the transverse displacements, which had not been explained until now.
I. INTRODUCTION
The dynamics of interfacial deformation between two fluids has been extensively studied experimentally, theoretically, and/or numerically [2–5], in the case of both miscible and non-miscible fluids. In particular, the gravity driven instabilities [Rayleigh–Taylor (RT) instabilities] have deserved great attention for a long time in fields as wide as the stability of viscous fluids immersed in magnetic fields [6], laser driven ablation problems [7,8], simulations of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities in magnetized stars [9], and the study of immiscible two-component Bose-Einstein condensates [10].
Recently, particular attention has been paid to the case of bimolecular reactions of the form A + B → C and also to the dissolution of CO_{2} (g) in aqueous solutions [11–13] and references therein. Rayleigh-Taylor, Double Diffusion (DD), and/or Dynamic Layer Convection type instabilities appear in all these systems. The case of the liquid-liquid interfaces has deserved detailed studies, both numerically and experimentally. It has been shown that generally, in a priori stable systems, occurrence of hydrodynamic instabilities is regulated by the existence of chemical reactions [14–16]. In situations that could give rise to both Rayleigh-Taylor and Double-Diffusion processes, the existence of chemical reactions causes important changes in the fingering pattern [5].
CO_{2} dissolution has also been extensively analyzed in the context of its geological sequestration. The dissolved solute usually regulates the convection at the gas-liquid interface; both experiments and numerical simulations have been performed [17,18]. The interaction of CO_{2} with other media solutes can alter the properties that regulate diffusion and convection processes in a way that can trigger or suppress the hydrodynamic instability [19,20].
In the previous analysis of CO_{2} absorption, although finger fusion (coalescence) in the region near the interface is mentioned [21,22], no explanation for the reason of the coalescence nor systematic analysis of what happens in these interfaces characterized by a physical frontier has been given.
II. MODEL
Although dynamics with transversal displacement could occur in either RT or DD instability situations [23] among others, in order to simplify the analysis of the incidence of a frontier, we will restrict our study to pure RT instabilities. RT is one of the classic examples of hydrodynamic instability where the mixing of two fluids takes place if a heavy fluid initially lies above a lighter one in a gravitational field [24]. Usually, this process can be considered taking place in a 2D region of the form shown in Fig. 1. The Hele Shaw cell contains a fluid in the upper part (containing a species A) and another fluid in the lower one (containing a species B). In order to take into account the presence of a physical frontier between both fluids, we do not allow the lower fluid to enter the upper cell neither by diffusion nor buoyancy. The incidence (presence) of the upper fluid in the lower cell will be modeled as a (fixed) boundary condition in the lower cell (Dirichlet condition). All the processes of interest will be developed in the lower part of the cell.
We will consider that there is no reaction of a denser fluid A with a less dense fluid B or any other species in the lower solution. Thus, the dynamics of A in the lower part will be given by a Diffusive Convective transport model (DC). The integration enclosure will be a 2D grid considering just the lower part of Fig. 1 (0 <x < L_{x}). The equations that govern the system are the concentration, Darcy, and continuity, respectively
where A is the concentration of the involved species, D is the diffusion coefficient, V is the flow velocity, P is the pressure, ρ is the density, μ is the dynamic viscosity, and K is the permeability of the solution in the cell. Although the fluid is considered incompressible, we will use the Boussinesq approximation to take into account how variations in density affect the movement of the fluid.
The physical variables (in capital letters) are made dimensionless as follows: a =A/a_{0}, (x, y) = (X, Y)/L_{0}, t = T/t_{0}, v = V/v_{0}, and p = P/p_{0}, where a_{0} is the initial concentration of species A and L_{0}, v_{0}, t_{0}, and p_{0} are the characteristic length, velocity, time, and pressure of the system, being for consistency v_{0} = L_{0}/t_{0}. Lowercase variables are dimensionless. Replacing in the equations of the system, we obtain
where Ra_{0}=KL_{0}gDν and Ra_{A}=KL_{0}ga_{0}αDν are the Rayleigh's numbers (Ra_{i}). The parameter α is the coefficient of molar expansion, and ν = μ/ρ is the kinematic viscosity. To arrive at these expressions, we have taken L02=4D_{A}t_{0}, from which it follows that the characteristic time is determined by the diffusion process. Also, we consider p_{0}=μL02Kt_{0}, and we will take the gap width of the cell as the characteristic length. As we will use the Rayleigh number corresponding to species A (Ra_{A}) to characterize the system, for simplicity, we will call it Ra.
We solve numerically the system using the Stokes function to determine the flow rate: (v=(∂ψ∂y,−∂ψ∂x)).
The Darcy equation gives the final model formed by the equations
It is observed that Ra depends on the initial concentration of species A. The initial concentration a_{0} is the magnitude that is varied in the numerical tests to analyze the behavior of the system.
The system of equations mentioned above is solved with a program developed by us using MATLAB and implementing a finite difference method. For the concentration equation, an alternating direction implicit (ADI) method is applied. The equation for the Stokes function corresponds to the Poisson equation. The method used for its resolution is that of Gauss-Seidel, technique applied for grids with a large number of elements [25]. We took care of checking the stability of the numerical solutions using the following conditions [26]:(V⋅ΔtΔx){2}<2⋅D⋅ΔtΔx^{2}<1. A grid of 250 × 750 elements was taken. We verified that for a spatial resolution and time step given by Δx = Δy < 0.2 and Δt< 0.001, all numerical simulations lead to similar results.
Taking into account the presence of the frontier, the boundary conditions will be those of a constant concentration at the interface (x = 0) and of no flow at the three other edges (y = 0; y = L_{y}; and x = L_{x}). For example, in the particular case of CO_{2} absorption, similar conditions had been used by Farajzadeh et_al [21]
With initial conditions inside the enclosure,
For comparison, a case where no frontier is present (a pure RT problem) was also analyzed. In order to do so, we replace Eq. (10) by
where the integration domain is now –L_{x} ≤ x ≤ L_{x} and 0 ≤ y ≤ L_{y}.
We analyze the dependence of the transversal movement of the fingers in the region close to the interface (x = 0) with respect to Ra in both types of systems. Varying Ra is analogous to vary the initial concentration a_{0}, which leads to a change in the density difference of the solutions keeping the other variables constant: K = 8.3 × 10^{−8} m^{2}; L_{0} = 1 × 10^{−3 }m; g = 9.8 m/s^{2}; α = 4.4 × 10^{−5} m^{3}/mol; D= 2.15 × 10^{−9} m^{2}/s; and ν = 1.0037 × 10^{−6} m^{2}/s. With these values, it is possible to compare the simulations made here with the experimental results reported in the study by Binda et_al [1]
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Figure 2 (Multimedia view) shows the images obtained for systems with and without a barrier at different times. The upper part of Fig. 2(a) shows that fingers develop a lateral movement and coarsening when a barrier is present. As it is well known, finger coarsening is often associated with diffusive effects and chemical reactions. The advance of the chemical front occurs all around the surface of the finger, leading to a coarsening effect [27]. Here, we do not have reaction, and the coarsening of the fingers is due to diffusive effects only. In the multimedia view, the video corresponding to Fig. 2 shows a lateral movement of the fingers near the barrier that is clearly more important than the coarsening due to diffusive effects. In fact, from the space–time maps (see below), it can be estimated that the coarsening by diffusion is around one third of the lateral displacement of the finger of its original trajectory. So, the lateral movement is the predominant effect.
In order to carefully visualize the temporal evolution of the system near the frontier, we also performed the corresponding space–time maps [bottom part of Fig. 2(a)]. Space-time maps of the fingers are obtained from a sequence of images of 0.15 thick (1 pixel), taken at a given distance (l = 1.5 in dimensionless units) from the interface. In this way, we follow the time evolution of a finger at these specific points in space similarly to following the movement of a fixed point in a wavy string. Figure 2(a) (bottom) shows the behavior of the specific points of the fingers situated at l distance from the interface.
To compare with a no frontier system, similar images are shown in Fig. 2(b). No lateral displacements are observed in this case. Figure 2(b) (top) shows the symmetry of fingering in pure RT instabilities (see, for example, Lemaigre [5] and references therein). The space-time map shows clearly that there is no lateral movement of the fingers.
In case there is a frontier, in the space–time maps, sometimes it is seen that the lateral movements produce a collapse of neighboring fingers. This collapse decreases the wave number in the region near the interface. If collapses do not occur, the fingers initiate an oscillatory movement similar to a damped oscillator. These observations are in agreement with experimental results reported by Binda et_al [1]
In order to analyze the behavior of the system, we study the relationship between the fingering and the Rayleigh number, where increasing Ra means to increase the initial concentration of the species a. Figure 3 shows the space–time maps for the frontier case for different Ra. We can see that as Ra increases, there are more fingers at the interface and the collapses of the fingers are produced at shorter times. These collapses lead to a decrease in the wave number of the instability next to the interface.
Based on these observations, a systematic study has been carried out for systems with a physical frontier. We analyze the transverse velocity of the fingers close to the interface, the amplitude of the oscillations in the case of occurrence, and the variation of the wave number for RT instabilities as a function of Ra. We define the transverse velocity of a finger as the lateral displacement distance of the finger in the space–time map divided by the time it takes to do it. The results corresponding to the variation of the transverse velocity are shown in Fig. 4 (blue dots). We can observe that as Ra increases, the transverse displacement velocity increases. As Ra is directly related to the variation of the density difference between the intervening solutions in the instability, which is modified by increasing the initial concentration a_{0}, the increase in transverse velocity would explain the increase in collapses observed in the space time maps shown in Fig. 3. We added in Fig. 4 the experimental data: red squares for the Gas–Liquid system (G–L) and black diamonds for the Liquid–Liquid system (L-L), obtained by Binda et_al [1] The same trend is observed for both experimental and numerical results.
Figure 5 shows the variation of the amplitude of the transversal displacements (the maximum lateral displacement distance of the finger in the space–time map) as a function of Ra. There is no appreciable amplitude variation with Ra ranging between 1000 and 2500. A similar behavior is observed in the experimental results (the average amplitude is 1.4 ± 0.2 when calculated numerically and 1.1 ± 0.1 when obtained experimentally). Based on these results and those shown in Fig. 4, increasing transverse velocity, we assume that there is an increase in the frequency of oscillation of the fingers, favoring their collapse when Ra increases.
On the other hand, we studied the wave numbers near the frontier obtained at the beginning of the development of the instabilities (initial wave number k_{0}) together with those obtained at the same place after collapse (wave number after the collapse k_{f}) for different Ra values (Fig. 6). As Ra increases, we observe a growth of k_{0} (denoted by red dots), in coincidence with the results reported by Hassanzadeh et_al [28], and a decrease in k_{f} (blue squares). Comparing these results with those obtained experimentally [1] (black diamonds and green triangles, respectively), we see the same tendency in both cases. The increase in the initial wave number with an increasing density difference (greater Ra) favors the collapse of neighboring fingers because they are closer, causing a decrease in k_{f} as time goes by. For Ra lower than 803, wave numbers k_{0} and k_{f} are the same, indicating that there is no finger collapse yet. This happens because the dynamics of the system decreases and the lateral movements are not so important.
The numerical results indicate that the increase in the Ra produces an increase in the transverse displacement velocity v of the fingering (Fig. 4), where v = (7.9 ± 0.3) × 10^{−4} Ra – (2.7 ± 0.5) × 10^{−1}, obtained by a linear fitting of the numerical data. The experimental and numerical results fit very well, the difference between the experimental and numerical slopes is less than 2.5% [(8.1 ± 0.2) × 10^{−4} and (7.9 ± 0.3) × 10^{−4}, respectively], and the average agreement between numerical and experimental transverse velocity is better than 19%. At the same time, an increase in k_{0} and a decrease in k_{f} (Fig. 6) are found. Therefore, the increase in the transverse velocity and k_{0} cause a collapse of neighboring fingers near the frontier, leading to a significant decrease in the wavenumber k_{f}. It is also possible to determine that the amplitude of the oscillations does not vary significantly with the increase in Ra (Fig. 5). This is in good agreement with the experimental results, and therefore, the amplitude of lateral movement is not the cause of the greater collapse of fingers, as shown in Fig. 3.
The images of the simulations corresponding to the transverse velocity of fingers and wave numbers before and after the collapse show a very good agreement with the experimental results obtained by Binda et_al [1] In particular, Fig. 6 shows good overlapping of the experimental and numerical wavenumbers. This agreement validates the equations and suppositions used to estimate Ra in the experimental part and shows that the numerical model used is adequate. When performing the numerical simulations, we do not specify any type of frontier, and so, our results are independent of considering a gas–liquid, a liquid–liquid, or a solid–liquid system.
On the other hand, in the case of systems without a frontier, when the fingers arrive to the limit given by the integration domain (x = L_{x} or x = −L_{x}), similar oscillations can be observed: the walls of the recipient are a solid frontier. Usually, systems are analyzed far from the solid extremes of the container to avoid these effects. Based on our results, we suggest that the behavior of the fingers near the walls will be similar to the lateral displacements described in this work. In the space–time map without a frontier given in Fig. 7, neighboring finger collapse is observed near the upper boundary of the integration domain.
In order to show that the presence of the frontier is responsible for the lateral movements, we have built the velocity field of the fluid near the frontier for Ra = 1618 at t = 2 (see Fig. 8). It is clearly seen that without a frontier, the fluid moves in a straight way following the gradient of density across the interface [red line in Fig. 8(a)]. When a frontier is present, the fluid is not able to follow its original path and the field vector turns around and starts to move in the opposite direction. Thus, we argue that there is no doubt that the mere existence of the frontier, whatever it is, is the origin of the behavior of the system near the interface. This behavior has been reported both experimentally and numerically in several articles in the literature [11,22,29] but with no explanation until now.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
We show numerically that the presence of a physical frontier produces a transversal displacement of the fingers. We suggest that the frontier prevents the fingers going through the interface, producing their lateral movement. Depending on the initial proximity of the fingers, they could collapse significantly, decreasing the wave number in the region close to the interface. Otherwise, it causes an oscillatory movement transversal to the fingering (see the supplementary material). On the other hand, as Ra is directly related to the difference in density between the intervening solutions, it is clear that the dynamics of the process increases when Ra increases. In this case, this is reflected in an increasing initial wave number and in an increasing lateral velocity. All these results are in very good agreement with the experimental observations [1].
In this paper, we report the results of numerical simulations for Rayleigh–Taylor (RT) instabilities when there is a frontier in the system. The RT instabilities are formed when a denser fluid is put on top of a less dense fluid. We demonstrated numerically that the frontier prevents the free movement of the fingers giving rise to lateral movements in the area near the interface. These movements produce collapse of the fingers or oscillations in the case that there is no collapse. The transversal velocity of the fingers, the amplitude of the oscillations, and the wave number of the RT instabilities as a function of the density difference between both fluids (Rayleigh number, Ra) were studied near the frontier. We also demonstrated numerically that in classical RT instabilities, without a frontier, these lateral movements were not produced. The numerical results show that lateral movements of the instabilities are independent of the type or origin of the frontier (gas-liquid, liquid-liquid, or solid-liquid). Based on numerical results, we show that the frontiers are the cause of the transversal displacements, a fact that had not been explained until now. The present work can be extended to instabilities originating from the displacement of a fluid of lower mobility by one of higher mobility.
The dynamics of interfacial deformation between two fluids has been extensively studied experimentally, theoretically, and/or numerically [2–5], in the case of both miscible and non-miscible fluids. In particular, the gravity driven instabilities [Rayleigh–Taylor (RT) instabilities] have deserved great attention for a long time in fields as wide as the stability of viscous fluids immersed in magnetic fields [6], laser driven ablation problems [7,8], simulations of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities in magnetized stars [9], and the study of immiscible two-component Bose-Einstein condensates [10].
Recently, particular attention has been paid to the case of bimolecular reactions of the form A + B → C and also to the dissolution of CO_{2} (g) in aqueous solutions [11–13] and references therein. Rayleigh-Taylor, Double Diffusion (DD), and/or Dynamic Layer Convection type instabilities appear in all these systems. The case of the liquid-liquid interfaces has deserved detailed studies, both numerically and experimentally. It has been shown that generally, in a priori stable systems, occurrence of hydrodynamic instabilities is regulated by the existence of chemical reactions [14–16]. In situations that could give rise to both Rayleigh-Taylor and Double-Diffusion processes, the existence of chemical reactions causes important changes in the fingering pattern [5].
CO_{2} dissolution has also been extensively analyzed in the context of its geological sequestration. The dissolved solute usually regulates the convection at the gas-liquid interface; both experiments and numerical simulations have been performed [17,18]. The interaction of CO_{2} with other media solutes can alter the properties that regulate diffusion and convection processes in a way that can trigger or suppress the hydrodynamic instability [19,20].
In the previous analysis of CO_{2} absorption, although finger fusion (coalescence) in the region near the interface is mentioned [21,22], no explanation for the reason of the coalescence nor systematic analysis of what happens in these interfaces characterized by a physical frontier has been given.
Although dynamics with transversal displacement could occur in either RT or DD instability situations [23] among others, in order to simplify the analysis of the incidence of a frontier, we will restrict our study to pure RT instabilities. RT is one of the classic examples of hydrodynamic instability where the mixing of two fluids takes place if a heavy fluid initially lies above a lighter one in a gravitational field [24]. Usually, this process can be considered taking place in a 2D region of the form shown in Fig. 1. The Hele Shaw cell contains a fluid in the upper part (containing a species A) and another fluid in the lower one (containing a species B). In order to take into account the presence of a physical frontier between both fluids, we do not allow the lower fluid to enter the upper cell neither by diffusion nor buoyancy. The incidence (presence) of the upper fluid in the lower cell will be modeled as a (fixed) boundary condition in the lower cell (Dirichlet condition). All the processes of interest will be developed in the lower part of the cell.
We will consider that there is no reaction of a denser fluid A with a less dense fluid B or any other species in the lower solution. Thus, the dynamics of A in the lower part will be given by a Diffusive Convective transport model (DC). The integration enclosure will be a 2D grid considering just the lower part of Fig. 1 (0 <x < L_{x}). The equations that govern the system are the concentration, Darcy, and continuity, respectively

The physical variables (in capital letters) are made dimensionless as follows: a =A/a_{0}, (x, y) = (X, Y)/L_{0}, t = T/t_{0}, v = V/v_{0}, and p = P/p_{0}, where a_{0} is the initial concentration of species A and L_{0}, v_{0}, t_{0}, and p_{0} are the characteristic length, velocity, time, and pressure of the system, being for consistency v_{0} = L_{0}/t_{0}. Lowercase variables are dimensionless. Replacing in the equations of the system, we obtain
where Ra_{0}=KL_{0}gDν and Ra_{A}=KL_{0}ga_{0}αDν are the Rayleigh's numbers (Ra_{i}). The parameter α is the coefficient of molar expansion, and ν = μ/ρ is the kinematic viscosity. To arrive at these expressions, we have taken L02=4D_{A}t_{0}, from which it follows that the characteristic time is determined by the diffusion process. Also, we consider p_{0}=μL02Kt_{0}, and we will take the gap width of the cell as the characteristic length. As we will use the Rayleigh number corresponding to species A (Ra_{A}) to characterize the system, for simplicity, we will call it Ra.
We solve numerically the system using the Stokes function to determine the flow rate: (v=(∂ψ∂y,−∂ψ∂x)).
The Darcy equation gives the final model formed by the equations
It is observed that Ra depends on the initial concentration of species A. The initial concentration a_{0} is the magnitude that is varied in the numerical tests to analyze the behavior of the system.
The system of equations mentioned above is solved with a program developed by us using MATLAB and implementing a finite difference method.

As Ra is directly related to the variation of the density difference between the intervening solutions in the instability, which is modified by increasing the initial concentration a_{0}, the increase in transverse velocity would explain the increase in collapses observed in the space time maps shown in Fig. 3. We added in Fig. 4 the experimental data: red squares for the Gas–Liquid system (G–L) and black diamonds for the Liquid–Liquid system (L-L), obtained by Binda et_al [1] The same trend is observed for both experimental and numerical results.
Figure 5 shows the variation of the amplitude of the transversal displacements (the maximum lateral displacement distance of the finger in the space–time map) as a function of Ra. There is no appreciable amplitude variation with Ra ranging between 1000 and 2500. A similar behavior is observed in the experimental results (the average amplitude is 1.4 ± 0.2 when calculated numerically and 1.1 ± 0.1 when obtained experimentally). Based on these results and those shown in Fig. 4, increasing transverse velocity, we assume that there is an increase in the frequency of oscillation of the fingers, favoring their collapse when Ra increases.
On the other hand, we studied the wave numbers near the frontier obtained at the beginning of the development of the instabilities (initial wave number k_{0}) together with those obtained at the same place after collapse (wave number after the collapse k_{f}) for different Ra values (Fig. 6). As Ra increases, we observe a growth of k_{0} (denoted by red dots), in coincidence with the results reported by Hassanzadeh et_al [28], and a decrease in k_{f} (blue squares). Comparing these results with those obtained experimentally [1] (black diamonds and green triangles, respectively), we see the same tendency in both cases. The increase in the initial wave number with an increasing density difference (greater Ra) favors the collapse of neighboring fingers because they are closer, causing a decrease in k_{f} as time goes by. For Ra lower than 803, wave numbers k_{0} and k_{f} are the same, indicating that there is no finger collapse yet. This happens because the dynamics of the system decreases and the lateral movements are not so important.
The numerical results indicate that the increase in the Ra produces an increase in the transverse displacement velocity v of the fingering (Fig. 4), where v = (7.9 ± 0.3) × 10^{−4} Ra – (2.7 ± 0.5) × 10^{−1}, obtained by a linear fitting of the numerical data. The experimental and numerical results fit very well, the difference between the experimental and numerical slopes is less than 2.5% [(8.1 ± 0.2) × 10^{−4} and (7.9 ± 0.3) × 10^{−4}, respectively], and the average agreement between numerical and experimental transverse velocity is better than 19%. At the same time, an increase in k_{0} and a decrease in k_{f} (Fig. 6) are found. Therefore, the increase in the transverse velocity and k_{0} cause a collapse of neighboring fingers near the frontier, leading to a significant decrease in the wavenumber k_{f}. It is also possible to determine that the amplitude of the oscillations does not vary significantly with the increase in Ra (Fig. 5). This is in good agreement with the experimental results, and therefore, the amplitude of lateral movement is not the cause of the greater collapse of fingers, as shown in Fig. 3.
The images of the simulations corresponding to the transverse velocity of fingers and wave numbers before and after the collapse show a very good agreement with the experimental results obtained by Binda et_al [1] In particular, Fig. 6 shows good overlapping of the experimental and numerical wavenumbers. This agreement validates the equations and suppositions used to estimate Ra in the experimental part and shows that the numerical model used is adequate. When performing the numerical simulations, we do not specify any type of frontier, and so, our results are independent of considering a gas–liquid, a liquid–liquid, or a solid–liquid system.
On the other hand, in the case of systems without a frontier, when the fingers arrive to the limit given by the integration domain (x = L_{x} or x = −L_{x}), similar oscillations can be observed: the walls of the recipient are a solid frontier. Usually, systems are analyzed far from the solid extremes of the container to avoid these effects. Based on our results, we suggest that the behavior of the fingers near the walls will be similar to the lateral displacements described in this work. In the space–time map without a frontier given in Fig. 7, neighboring finger collapse is observed near the upper boundary of the integration domain.
In order to show that the presence of the frontier is responsible for the lateral movements, we have built the velocity field of the fluid near the frontier for Ra = 1618 at t = 2 (see Fig. 8). It is clearly seen that without a frontier, the fluid moves in a straight way following the gradient of density across the interface [red line in Fig. 8(a)]. When a frontier is present, the fluid is not able to follow its original path and the field vector turns around and starts to move in the opposite direction. Thus, we argue that there is no doubt that the mere existence of the frontier, whatever it is, is the origin of the behavior of the system near the interface. This behavior has been reported both experimentally and numerically in several articles in the literature [11,22,29] but with no explanation until now.
We show numerically that the presence of a physical frontier produces a transversal displacement of the fingers. We suggest that the frontier prevents the fingers going through the interface, producing their lateral movement. Depending on the initial proximity of the fingers, they could collapse significantly, decreasing the wave number in the region close to the interface. Otherwise, it causes an oscillatory movement transversal to the fingering (see the supplementary material). On the other hand, as Ra is directly related to the difference in density between the intervening solutions, it is clear that the dynamics of the process increases when Ra increases. In this case, this is reflected in an increasing initial wave number and in an increasing lateral velocity. All these results are in very good agreement with the experimental observations [1].
