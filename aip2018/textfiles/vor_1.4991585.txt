Diagnostics of microwave assisted electron cyclotron resonance plasma source for surface modification of nylon 6
Looking at the increasing scope of plasma processing of materials surface, here we present the development and diagnostics of a microwave assisted Electron Cyclotron Resonance (ECR) plasma system suitable for surface modification of polymers. Prior to the surface-treatment, a detailed diagnostic mapping of the plasma parameters throughout the reactor chamber was carried out by using single and double Langmuir probe measurements in Ar plasma. Conventional analysis of I-V curves as well as the elucidation form of the Electron Energy Distribution Function (EEDF) has become the source of calibration of plasma parameters in the reaction chamber. The high energy tail in the EEDF of electron temperature is seen to extend beyond 60 eV, at much larger distances from the ECR zone. This proves the suitability of the rector for plasma processing, since the electron energy is much beyond the threshold energy of bond breaking in most of the polymers. Nylon 6 is used as a representative candidate for surface processing in the presence of Ar, H_{2} + N_{2}, and O_{2} plasma, treated at different locations inside the plasma chamber. In a typical case, the work of adhesion is seen to almost get doubled when treated with oxygen plasma. Morphology of the plasma treated surface and its hydrophilicity are discussed in view of the variation in electron density and electron temperature at these locations. Nano-protrusions arising from plasma treatment are set to be responsible for the hydrophobicity. Chemical sputtering and physical sputtering are seen to influence the surface morphology on account of sufficient electron energies and increased plasma potential.
I. INTRODUCTION
Recently, surface processing of materials, using plasma, has gained much importance due to its various applications. Surface modifications are required in the field of electronic devices, antistatic polymers, sterilization of medical equipment [1], surface cleaning [2], thin film deposition, drug delivery [3], industrial metallurgy, tissue engineering [4–6], biosensors, printing technology, textile industry [7], packaging of food stuff [8], and similar others [9,10]. Also, there has been an increasing interest in surface modification [11–13] of polymers for improving their physical, chemical, and mechanical properties suitable for biological applications. Such modifications can increase the processibility of many inexpensive polymers and make them biocompatible. It is known that the biocompatibility of polymers is associated with the surface free energy and hence its wettability [14]. The latter is a balance between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic character of the surface. Most of the polymeric surfaces are hydrophobic in nature and exhibit low surface energy, whereas the hydrophilicity of polymer surfaces can be strengthened by the proper choice of plasma parameters. A treated biocompatible polymer surface can also be used for the proliferation of living cells in the implant surgery [1]. Other important factors of a treated polymer include its surface-roughness, surface polarity, and functionalization. It has been well documented that plasma surface interaction can induce the required modifications and hence alter the surface properties. Varieties of polymers such as polycarbonate, polystyrene, polyether-ether ketone, and nylon are widely used for biological applications. Out of these, nylon 6 has gained more attention due to its distinct properties which include its low cost, strong chemical and thermal stability, biocompatibility, flexibility of deriving various shapes, and possibility of surface functionalization. The virgin surface of nylon 6 shows low hydrophilicity and biocompatibility which makes it less applicable in the area of tissue engineering. Alternative methods of surface modification include ion implantation [15–17], electron irradiation [18,19], laser treatment [20], and sand blasting and wet chemical treatment [13,21,22]. However, plasma treatment is one of the versatile options due to its spatial uniformity and ease of processibility. Moreover, due to the limited penetrating nature, it does not cause any damage to the bulk of polymer.
Amongst various plasma sources, microwave assisted electron cyclotron resonance plasma has several additional advantages which makes it unique. It is an electrode less plasma working at much lower pressures (10^{−2}-10^{−4} mbar) and thus adds cleanliness to the atmosphere. The presence of the magnetic field increases the energy of electrons (>10 eV) and its density (10^{16}-10^{18} m^{−3}), useful for efficient surface modification. However, in view of understanding the role of plasma treatment, in terms of nature of species their energy and density; optimization of the system parameters is often required. Here we present the development of an Electron Cyclotron Resonance (ECR) plasma reactor which can provide suitable electron density and electron energy to induce modifications in surface free energy of polymers. The literature reveals that based on the applications such as sputtering, thin film deposition [23], surface interaction [24], surface cleaning, and surface etching [25]; different geometries of ECR plasma systems have been used. Use of ECR plasma as a high current ion source is also very well known in the diagnostic research [26]. However, in spite of the availability of commercial systems, laboratory setups have remained popular due to the interests in understanding of fundamental processes. It is well understood that the high field region of ECR plasma shows a non-uniform radial distribution of electron temperature and electron density (i.e., number density; n_{e}), whereas they are more uniform in the low field region.
The paper, therefore, reports a detailed diagnostic study of a microwave assisted ECR plasma reactor, developed in our laboratory, in view of measuring the electron energy distribution function at different locations inside the reaction chamber. Plasma properties like electron temperature (T_{e}), number density (n_{e}), Debye length (λ_{D}), plasma potential (V_{p}), and floating potential (V_{f}) have been measured by using electrostatic probes. Further, the plasma species generated using Ar, H_{2} + N_{2}, and O_{2} were used for surface processing of a biocompatible-polymer, namely, nylon 6, so as to understand the nature of plasma polymer surface interaction. Morphological properties related to the surface energy have been studied before and after plasma exposure in different conditions.
II. EXPERIMENTAL
A. ECR plasma source
Figure 1(a) shows the schematic representation of the ECR plasma source. A variable power (maximum 500 W) 2.45 GHz microwave source (magnetron) was connected to a rectangular wave guide to generate TE_{10} mode. It was coupled to a rectangular-to-circular mode convertor to facilitate the TE_{11} mode entering into the resonance cavity through a quartz window. The cavity was further coupled to a reaction chamber consisting of a 300 mm diameter cylindrical multiport stainless steel chamber with 200 mm height. Two solenoids coupled back to back and surrounding the cavity, provided the required magnetic field of 875 G at a distance of 30 mm below the quartz window. Positions of the solenoids could be adjusted so as to properly tune the ECR region inside the cavity. Figure 1(b) shows the magnetic field variation as a function of distance Z (cm) measured from the center of solenoid pair. The whole assembly was evacuated by a turbomolecular pump connected to the reaction chamber. Prior to injecting the plasma-gen gas into the reactor, a base pressure of 10^{−6} mbar was obtained in the reaction chamber. Plasma gases like Ar, H_{2} + N_{2}, and O_{2} were injected into the cavity through mass flow controllers and gas mixer (whenever required), till the pressure reached a value of 10^{−4}–10^{−2} mbar. Inverted bucket shaped plasma, having a spread over 150 mm diameter, was obtained in the reaction chamber, as represented, conceptually in Fig. 1(c).
The reaction chamber was provided with a 150 mm diameter view port and four 70 mm diameter ports for connecting different assemblies like gauge head, Residual Gas Analyzer (RGA) head, needle valve, and horizontal and vertical shafts. The view port was also used for recording optical emission spectra, through a lens system and optical fiber. The spectra could be recorded at different axial and radial positions inside the chamber using the “Ocean Optics” spectrometer model HR 4000. The 150 mm port was fitted with hinge joints, in order to facilitate an easy access of sample loading. The sample holder, fitted on the lower port opposite to the resonance cavity, was made movable by proper vacuum seal joints. Electrical feedthroughs were fitted on the 150 mm bottom flange. A residual gas analyzer (SRS RGA 100) was fitted to the reaction chamber and was evacuated by a separate diffusion pump so as to maintain a differential pressure relative to the plasma chamber. The RGA was used to identify the purity of Ar as a plasma forming gas, by monitoring the concentration of the major species at an operating pressure of 10^{−3} mbar in the ECR reactor chamber. The spectral data indicate that there are no major impurities in Ar which was used for plasma diagnostics.
Mapping of plasma parameters in the processing chamber was carried out by using the Single Langmuir Probe (SLP) and Double Langmuir Probe (DLP) assemblies. The probe consisted of 0.25 mm diameter (10 mm length) cylindrical tungsten wire mounted on an electrically shielded Teflon holder; it was fully covered with a conducting shield to overcome the space charge effect. DLP geometry consisted of two similar cylindrical wires (0.25 mm) mounted on a Teflon holder and separated by 10 mm. It was mounted on a sample holder which could be moved axially from Z = 15 cm (near zone position) to Z = 31 cm (away from the zone position) as shown in Fig. 1(c). Plasma diagnostics was carried out in the Ar plasma alone. The cross-sectional view of the ECR plasma reactor is presented in Fig. 1(d).
A sweep voltage in the range of −20 V to +60 V was applied to the SLP with respect to ground terminal (i.e., plasma chamber) using Keithley 2400 sourcemeter. I-V measurements in case of the SLP were carried out by sweeping the voltage from −20 V to +60 V in the step of 0.5 V and delay time of 0.1 s. The measurements were repeated for four times to insure reproducibility of the data. In similar manner, a sweep voltage of −60 V to +60 V was applied between the two tungsten electrodes in the step of 0.5 V with delay time of 0.1 s in case of the DLP using the same Keithley sourcemeter, which was computer interfaced by using the LabTracer software. Various plasma parameters, namely, T_{e}, n_{e}, V_{p}, n_{i}, and λ_{D} were determined from the I-V curve.
Probe measurements are prone to various errors. Apart from the errors arising from the instruments used for current and voltage measurements, there are inherent errors in the probe theory. Since the probe is immersed in a harsh environment, special care should be taken to protect it from the harsh environment. The electrode holding, the tungsten tip, used as a Langmuir probe, must be ideally covered by a ceramic tube which is assumed to be thin enough (preferably < 1 mm) [27]. However, it is hardly possible in practice to use such a thin coating. Moreover, in the present setup, a thick metal tube is used to support the probe tip assembly which can modify the plasma to a certain extent, and therefore the characteristics may get affected. Even while measuring the probe current, there are two basic ways in which voltage “V” is applied to the probe, and current “I” collected by the probe from the plasma is measured. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages. In the first case, the bias supply is connected in series to the probe and a grounded resistor. This arrangement has the advantage that the measuring resistor is grounded and thus the measurements are not subjected to spurious pickups. However, the disadvantage is that the bias supply has to be kept perfect floating. The bias supply can also act as an antenna which can pickup noise. In the other method, the bias supply can be grounded, and the resistance can be connected in series to the probe. However, the voltage has to be now measured by a floating method. In either of the methods, some error is introduced in the measurements due to stray capacitance. In the present experiments, we have employed floating method, i.e., the one described later. About the stray noises, it has been clearly stated by Chen [27] that microwave sources do not add to the stray noises since the frequency of the source is too high so that it is completely decoupled from the circuitry, and the measured currents are the same as in a DC discharge. These errors are common to both the SLP and DLP measurements. Although both the methods have same sources of error, the DLP offers fairly significant amount of current suitable for comparison. In addition non-Maxwellian distribution, sheath effect and perturbation in plasma introduce error in these measurements. The probe surface is often affected by secondary electron emission, if the applied voltage is sufficiently high.
Bombardment of high energy particles from the discharge, which may cause sputtering of ions from the metallic surfaces, may also contribute toward error in the measurements. A deposit on the insulated part of the probe, close to the exposed region, may actually increase the effective collection area, creating large discrepancies. Also if the plasma is intense, it may cause arcing between the cathodic probe and the anodic sheath edge such an “unipolar arc” is capable of destroying a probe or may result into erroneous data.
In the ECR plasma reactor, plasma species are confined due to the magnetic field, and, therefore, the magnetic field distribution in reaction chamber is bound to affect the measured currents. The plasma parameters determined from both the SLP and DLP are subjected to errors caused by this. Apart from these ambiguities, statistical errors are unavoidable. In addition, there might be few factors which need to be considered in the ECR chamber like non-uniform microwave power distribution and magnetic field distribution. These can cause plasma density variation. The specific source of error arises in SLP measurement because it perturbs the larger plasma region. In spite of this, the SLP is useful since it can be used to estimate floating potential and plasma potential additionally along with electron temperature and electron density. Each measurement was repeated for four times and the percent error was estimated. It was seen that the error in the electron temperature measurement was approximately ±10%, whereas ±8% for the plasma potential and as much as ±18% for the electron density.
As a result of interaction of plasma species with the polymer surface, morphology changes significantly and hence surface energy and wettability. The surface energy was estimated using self-developed contact angle measurement setup. The contact angle setup includes the proper leveling and alignment of the sample and camera with the horizontal axis. Images were captured by the Canon camera with 10× magnification. The contact angle is measured using the ImageJ software. Further, the surface morphology was recorded using scanning electron microscopy (JEOL JSM-6360A).
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Prior to the plasma treatment of nylon 6 with Ar, H_{2} + N_{2}, and O_{2} for increasing the surface wettability, it was necessary to study the purity of plasma species and their relative densities in addition to monitoring the electron temperature and electron densities. A systematic analysis was, therefore, undertaken so as to optimize the plasma parameters suitable for surface processing.
A. Optical emission spectroscopy
An optical emission spectroscopic measurement provides information about the presence of atomic species generated in plasma and the relative variation of electron density at different locations of the reaction chamber. The data generated from these measurements were useful to optimize the processing zone, necessary for surface modification of the polymer. Figures 2(a)–2(c) show the Optical Emission Spectra (OES) corresponding to Ar, H_{2} + N_{2}, and O_{2} plasmas, respectively, recorded at the same operating parameter and Z = 23 cm from the ECR zone. Major lines were identified with the help of NIST database [28] and are labeled accordingly. From the spectrograph, one can correlate the intensity with the density of species. Intensity of the typical line of a particular species was used to get an idea about relative variation of plasma density as a function of the axial distance from the zone as shown in Figs. 2(d)–2(f), for Ar, H_{2} + N_{2}, and O_{2}, respectively. Intensities of emission lines observed at 910, 486, 660, and 775 nm belong to Ar, H_{β}, atomic nitrogen, and atomic oxygen, respectively. These were analyzed as a function of axial distance at the center of the ECR reactor chamber. A decrease in the line intensity attributes to lowering of plasma density as one move away from the ECR zone. OES also indicate that the ECR plasma, generated in the reactor, has gaseous purity required for surface processing.
B. Single Langmuir Probe (SLP) measurements
Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show the I-V characteristics recorded at different positions from the ECR zone in the presence of Ar plasma, using SLP configuration for two different operating pressures, namely, 0.001 mbar and 0.005 mbar, respectively. There are mainly three regions in the I-V curves: (I) the ion saturation region (3rd quadrant), (II) the transition region (1st quadrant), and (III) the electron saturation region (1st quadrant). Conventional analyses of such curves were carried out using the method discussed by Chen and Chang [27].
Figure 3 shows that the electron current for Z = 15 cm and Z = 19 cm get saturated around +10 V and +20 V, respectively, for both pressures. However, such saturation is not obtained for currents recorded at larger Z values. On the other hand, two slopes are seen in the I-V characteristics for Z values of 23, 27, and 31 cm. A separate log plot for the I-V characteristics recorded for Z = 23 cm (as a representative) has been shown in the inset of Fig. 3(a). Plasma parameters, namely, floating potential, plasma potential, electron temperature, electron density, and Debye length were determined from these I-V curves using standard probe theory [27]. Applied voltage, for which the probe current is zero, refers to the floating potential (V_{f}), whereas the applied potential above which the electron current saturates is called as plasma potential. More accurately that can be measured from the maximum value of 1^{st} derivative of the I-V curve or zero crossing of the second derivative of the I-V curve were used to find out plasma potential. Further, the Debye length, λ_{D}, was also obtained from these plots using the relation
where “ε_{0}” is the dielectric permittivity of free space. For the cylindrical probe measurements, in magnetized plasma, “collisionless condition” depends on four plasma parameters, namely, the Larmor radius r_{L}, radius of the probe r_{p}, Debye length λ_{D}, and electron mean free path λ_{e}. Experimentally, these parameters are known to vary as [29]
Probe currents were recorded at different axial distances (Z), measured from the ECR zone, as shown in Fig. 3. It is seen that magnitude of saturation current is higher in the region close to the ECR zone than that recorded away from it. Magnitude of the probe current in the first quadrant of I-V characteristics is correlated with the electron density, and it is maximum for Z = 15 cm in both the cases. It is directly evident that electron density falls as one moves away from the ECR region. Plasma properties (V_{f}, V_{p}, T_{e}, n_{e}, and λ_{D}), calculated from SLP measurements for the two different operating pressures, are graphically presented in Fig. 4.
The first parameter of importance is electron density (n_{e}) which is seen to decrease, for both the operating pressures, as we move away from the ECR zone. Lower electron density at lower neutral pressure is expected due to lower density of gas molecules available for ionization. A decrease in the electron density with increasing distance is expected since the plasma continuously spreads in the reaction zone. As one moves away from the ECR zone toward the reaction zone and has a conical spreading feature. Within the experimental accuracy, the value of electron temperature is seen to vary marginally (with Z) as estimated by the conventional method. However, for all Z values electron temperature for higher operating pressure is slightly lower. This is expected since electron temperature decreases, with an increase in neutral gas pressure, due to increased collisions between electrons and neutrals. In general, the electron temperature is related to the neutral gas pressure “p” by the expression [30],
where “p” is the neutral gas pressure in the plasma chamber. The coefficient α and β are constants and can be determined from other system parameters. Magnitudes of plasma potential, floating potential, and Debye length are seen to increase with increasing distance (Z) from the ECR zone. An increase in the Debye length indicates a decrease in the number of electrons in the Debye sphere. The origin of plasma potential in ECR plasma sources may be necessary to be accounted for understanding the reason behind its variation with the Z value. It is known that in ECR plasma the electron cloud generated in the ECR region (Z = 0) tries to escape quickly out of zone because of its diamagnetic nature leaving ions behind. This builds a space charge potential which is called as plasma potential [31] and is responsible for an ambipolar diffusion. Near the probe, the sheath potential (typically for a planer surface) developed is given by [32]
Thus, in general, V_{p} α kT_{e}. It is seen from Fig. 4(c) that the plasma potential increases with increasing Z value, since electron temperature is seen to increase with increasing Z value.
Presented data satisfied the collisionless condition as required by Eq. (2), since for the operating pressures used in the present study; the mean free path is expected to be of the order of few centimeters. This is much larger compared to the radius of the probe (0.125 mm) and Debye length (∼μm).
Magnitude of electron temperature, obtained from the previous analysis, provides the average value of electron energy. However, in the application of a material processing surface, species are more influenced by high energy electrons. In order to understand their contributions, it is imperative to derive an Electron Energy Distribution Function (EEDF) from the measured I-V characteristics. The high energy electrons are produces near the ECR zone where the distribution is known to be bi-Maxwellian [33,34]. It has also been reported that ECR plasma is characterized by an anisotropy of electron temperature due to the magnetic field [35]. Here it is useful to apply the Druyvesteyn distribution function [32] which is based on the modified kinetic theory of gases. The modification involves the differences in kinetic energy possessed by individual constituents, i.e., electrons and ions (especially in cold plasmas). The distribution function is related to the second derivative of the I-V curve and is given by [36]
where f_{e}(ε) is the Electron Energy Distribution Function (EEDF), A_{p} is the probe area, d^{2}IdV^{2} is the second derivative of the I-V curve, and ε is equal to the net energy of the electrons, i.e., ε = e (Vp − V). Here, V is the applied potential, and V_{p} is the plasma potential. Integration of f_{e}(ε) gives the plasma density and is given by
Further, we obtain the average electron energy from
Effective electron temperature is then ⟨T_{eff}⟩ = 23 ⟨ε⟩. The EEDF is derived from the data presented in I-V curves of Fig. 3, with the help of the software—MATLAB, using Eq. (5). Plots of the EEDF’s, obtained from this analysis, are shown in Fig. 5 for different Z values and for two different operating pressures. It is seen that, high energy (10–50 eV) electrons are present in the tail side of the distribution at high Z values. This observation indicates that the electrons present in the ECR region undergo number of collisions and hence transfer their energy causing ionization, whereas, away from the ECR zone, the electrons experience less collisions. It has to be noted that in the ECR plasma reactor temperature in the tail region may be equal to or even higher than those in the ECR zone [35,37]. This has been understood based on the fact that the low energy electrons in the tail of the distribution lose their energy through collisions more easily than high energy electrons in the tail of the distribution.
Figure 5 also indicates that the experimentally observed data fits to the Druyvesteyn distribution function with quite a good accuracy (with a least square fit of 1.76 × 10^{−6}) for all the measurements in the present investigation. For the operating pressure of 0.001 mbar, a peak is observed around 2 eV having a spread in the range of 0-5 eV, for the data recorded at Z = 15 cm. Further, with an increase in distance from the ECR zone, the peak seems to be broadened and the second peak in the high energy side has started emerging. This indicates a transition to the bimodal distribution of energy. Also the spread of the peak has started increasing with increasing distance. The overall trend has remained similar for the higher operating pressure [as shown in Fig. 5(b) for 0.005 mbar], except that the first peak is broad and prominent as compare with the second one.
The software also used to estimate plasma parameters, like electron density, effective electron temperature, and plasma potential. These derived values are presented in Fig. 6. Here we observe that the plasma potential has increased in the downstream region, but it is not much affected by the operating pressures. The effective electron temperature also shows an enhancement in the same region for both the operating pressures. An increase in the effective electron temperature is expected on account of reduced collision in the downstream region as well as the contribution of high energy electron. As an effect of an increase in effective electron temperature, the Debye length has also increased as clearly shown in Fig. 6(d). It is clearly seen from Figs. 6(b) and 6(c) that both T_{e} and V_{p} have same trend as it is expected from Eq. (4).
The main advantage of SLP measurements lies in the application of the Laframboise model [29] to estimate the ion density without the knowledge of electron temperature. The model includes the classical Langmuir Orbital Motion Limited (OML) theory [38,39] based on the assumptions that electron temperature is much higher than the ion temperature, and the probe sheath is thick. For thick sheath, the ratio “rp/λ_{D}” should be less than 3. In the present case, for the probe radius of 0.125 mm, the ratio is less than 3, at larger “Z” values only. Ion density (n_{i}) was, therefore, determined from the ion current, recorded in the third quadrant of Fig. 3, for the larger “Z” values alone. The value of n_{i} is obtained using the relation
where I_{i} is the ion saturation current, A is the probe area, V_{pv} = (V − V_{p}) is probe voltage in volt, and M_{i} is the mass of Ar^{+} ion. Ion density estimated is found to be slightly higher in magnitude than that of n_{e} and varied in the range of 10^{17}-10^{16} m^{−3} with changing Z for both the operating pressures.
In spite of the added advantages, it is known that SLP configuration perturbs a large plasma region which leads to erroneous values of plasma parameters [36]. To overcome these difficulties, Double Langmuir Probe (DLP) configuration was used, the results of which are presented in Sec. III C.
C. Double Langmuir Probe (DLP) measurements
Nature of the I-V curve, recorded using DLP configuration, is normally different than that of SLP configuration. In DLP configuration, both the electrodes record the electron currents with respect to each other, during their positive voltage sweeps. The slope of the I-V curve at I = 0 and the value of electron saturation current are used to determine the electron temperature “T_{e}” using the normal standard expressions [27]. The pre-calculated values of electron temperature and electron density were used to further estimate the other plasma parameters.
I-V characteristics, recorded at different axial positions, using DLP configuration for Ar plasma, at two operating pressures are shown in Fig. 7. T_{e} and n_{e} were calculated using the standard expression.
It is seen from Fig. 7 that, the magnitude of the probe current is maximum for Z = 15 cm and it decreases with increasing distance from 15 to 31 cm. Moreover, the magnitudes of currents are seen to be less, by about an order, than those recorded using SLP configuration, whereas the collecting probes are of the same area. This is because the electron collection is governed by ion space charge which is large in the case of the SLP. It may be noticed that the lower magnitudes of current collected in the DLP configuration does not disturb the plasma and therefore reduces the error in measurements. In the DLP, the I-V curve is symmetrical since both probes have equal area for current collection. At V = 0 V, I = 0 and the two probes are at floating potential. The maximum current to either of the probes is limited by the ion saturation current with the transition region in between the two. Figure 8 shows the plots of different plasma parameters, estimated from I-V characteristics recorded using DLP configuration, for the two operating pressures. Nature of variation of different plasma parameters is not much different than what is observed in the case of the SLP. However, the magnitude of the average electron temperature is seen to be higher by one order of magnitude.
The second derivatives of I-V curves were, further, used to calculate the EEDF as shown in Fig. 9. There is a remarkable difference in the EEDF curves when compared with those obtained from SLP measurements. The width of the distribution is seen to increase for each measurement, and it is not bimodal in nature. It is also observed that the peak value shifts toward higher energy as one moves away from the ECR zone. Moreover, the high energy component has sufficiently high intensity compared to that obtained with the SLP configuration. Plasma parameters were subsequently calculated from the EEDF outputs and are graphically presented in Fig. 10. Effective electron temperature is seen to increase with increasing distance at two different pressures. This electron temperature is quite high as compared to that derived from SLP measurements shown in Fig. 6. The calculated electron density is also seen to be high; meaning thereby the accuracy of the measurement in the DLP.
The plasma density and its variation in the reaction chamber have been clearly evident from the plots shown in Figs. 4(a), 6(a), 8(a), and 10(a). The variation of plasma density in the ECR reactor for different electron temperature was further estimated using the Saha ionization equation. Here we consider the first ionization of atomic Ar in low pressure plasma, where the electron density is equal to that of ion density (i.e., n_{e} = n_{i}). Under this condition, the Saha ionization equation is given by [40]
where m_{e} is mass of electron, Q_{I} and Q_{a} are the internal partitions functions of ions and atoms, T_{e} is electron temperature (eV), E_{i} is the 1st ionization energy, T_{i} is the temperature of ions, n_{a}, n_{e}, and n_{i}, respectively, are the atom, electron, and ion number density. For the non-equilibrium plasma (T_{e} ≠ T_{i}), pressure p = [n_{e} kT_{e} + (n_{e} + n_{i}) kT_{i}]. A computer code was compiled in FORTRAN to solve the equation and obtain electron density value for different chosen parameters. Electron temperature was considered to vary in the range of 2–20 eV (as has been experimentally determined in the present study). In the present case the ion temperature is taken as 1 eV, which is valid for low pressure ECR plasma.
The electron density, obtained for different electron temperatures recorded at two different pressures is shown in Table I. The estimated results are in fairly good agreement with those found experimentally and validate the observed variation of electron temperature with electron density at two pressures.
D. Surface processing of polymer
Exposure of the polymer surface to sufficiently high energy electrons is one of the strategies used to modify the polymer surface and hence to change hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity. In the present case, it is achieved by means of ECR plasma generated using Ar, H_{2} + N_{2}, and O_{2} gases. On account of differences in collision cross sections, the electron energy distribution for different gaseous plasmas may not remain same. However, we have made an attempt to correlate the resulting properties of plasma treated surfaces with the axial trend of measured plasma properties in the case of Ar. The suitability of the ECR reactor for processing of polymer surfaces is demonstrated by choosing nylon 6 as a representative model. The morphological changes vis-à-vis the plasma treatment were investigated by studying the scanning electron micrographs and contact angles of the treated surfaces only for two extreme axial positions (Z = 15 cm and Z = 23 cm) and an operating pressure of 0.005 mbar. Surface energy (work of adhesion) was calculated using the relation
where γ_{1} is the surface energy of distilled water (72.8 mJ/m^{2}) and θ is the contact angle of water with the surface [41]. Measured contact angles and work of adhesion (or surface energy) are given in Table II.
Since in ECR plasma electrons are known to be the major species responsible in surface interactions, it is expected that the electron density and plasma potential as well as electron temperature will determine the extent of reaction. From the plasma diagnostics, it is clear that the electron density reduces as one move away from the ECR zone. However, the electron temperature increases with an increase in distance.
1. Effect of Ar plasma treatment
Figure 11 shows the SEM micrographs of nylon 6 surfaces treated at the two axial positions in the reactor chamber for an optimized time of 20 min, using Ar plasma along with the photographs of water droplets, casted on the surfaces, for contact angle measurements.
The surface of the untreated film of nylon 6 seems to be smooth, at the observed resolution of SEM, shown in Fig. 11(a1). This surface is almost hydrophobic with a contact angle of ∼70° [Fig. 11(b1)]. On the other hand, the plasma treated surface exhibits surface-architecture with small globules as can be seen in the micrographs shown in Figs. 11(a2) and 11(a3). The contact angle is seen to reduce after plasma treatment in each case. However, at Z = 15 cm, the size of the globule as well as their separation is large as compared to that observed at Z = 23 cm. This indicates an increased amount of surface etching. The contact angle for Z = 23 cm is larger since the globule size and separation is small (Lotus leaf effect) [42] as compared to that in Z = 15 cm. The higher amount of etching at Z = 15 cm might be correlated to relatively high electron density. Here we have to clarify that only electrons are responsible in low pressure plasmas for the surface modification. Ions do not play any role since their energies are much smaller (1-2 eV) [43]. In order to avoid the influence of other plasma parameters and see the effect of total flux deposited on to the surface, we have reduced the time of exposure from 20 min to 10 min at Z = 15 cm. It is interesting to note that the contact angle of the treated sample changes from 4° to 18° as shown in Table II (column 3). From this comparison, it appears that the total electron fluence is one of the prominent parameters affecting polymer surface processing. This might be so, in the present case, because the electron temperature as estimated from the electrostatic measurements for the chosen axial positions. This energy is much higher than the threshold values for bond breaking (3 to 8 eV) [43]. It is therefore possible to control the surface texture of a polymer by proper choice of position and time of plasma treatment in the present reactor.
2. Effect of H_{2} + N_{2} plasma treatment
Figure 12 shows the SEM micrographs of surfaces treated at the two axial positions in the reactor chamber for an optimized time of 20 min, using H_{2} + N_{2} plasma along with the photographs of water droplets, casted on the surfaces, for contact angle measurements. The texture of the treated surface in this case looks to be quite different as compared to that of Ar. Moreover, the texture of the H_{2} + N_{2} plasma treated surface, at Z = 23 cm, is much finer and denser as compared to that treated with Z = 15 cm. A similar set of experiments were repeated as in the case of Ar for eliminating the effect of plasma fluence. The contact angle measured for plasma treatment at Z = 15 cm for 10 min again shows the same hydrophobicity as observed in Z = 23 cm for 20 min treatment shown in Table II (column 4). The arguments in relation to the electron temperature of plasma species in the case of H_{2} + N_{2} may not be much different as compared to that of Ar.
3. Effect of O_{2} plasma treatment
Figure 13 shows the SEM micrographs of the surface treated at the two axial positions in the reactor chamber for an optimized time of 20 min, using O_{2} plasma along with the photographs of the water droplet, casted on the surface, for contact angle measurements. The SEM micrographs obtained for Z = 15 cm are slightly different than the previous cases. The globules are brighter and more scattered in the present case. The increased brightness of the globules indicates the increased height of the hillocks. The texture of the surface observed for Z = 23 cm is much different as compared to that observed for Ar and H_{2} + N_{2} plasma. An increased amount of etching with O_{2} plasma is clearly inferred from the micrographs. Effect of fluence was again confirmed by carrying out the measurement of a sample exposed to oxygen plasma for 10 min at Z = 15 cm, again we observed an increase in the hydrophobicity as tabulated in Table II (column 5). Once again we come to the conclusion that total plasma fluence (or total energy deposition) surely matters in restructuring of the surface when sufficient electron energy is available.
The role of gas molecules is seen to cause a pronounced change in the morphology. Oxygen is seen to produce larger sized 3D globules which are less densely spread. Whereas H_{2} + N_{2} has produced smaller globules which are denser as compared to that in the case of oxygen. On the other hand, Ar is seen to generate denser globules which are smaller in size compared to other two plasma gases. Effect of the gas molecule in plasma might be correlated to the reactive sputtering or reactive functionalization. Atomic oxygen is known to be highly reactive as far as the polymer surface is concerned. Here it is much easier to break the C–H bonds on account of affinity of O toward H. Overall analysis of ECR plasma developed in the present case shows that there is contribution from low energy electrons (0–15 eV) as well as high energy electrons (>15 eV). On account of availability of these electrons at all the positions in the reactor chamber, it is easy to carry out the plasma processing at all the positions in the reactor chamber by simply controlling the total fluence.
Another factor which influences the etching reactivity in low pressure plasma is the plasma potential. Plasma etching is a synergetic process involving physical and chemical surface reactions. Chemical sputtering is caused due to the ionic reactivity of plasma gases with the polymer surfaces, whereas physical sputtering is affected by the acceleration of positive ions in plasma potential. It has been observed in our previous analysis that the plasma potential increases with increasing Z value. This may result into a repulsive interaction of ions at larger Z values. Thus, the damage caused by physical interaction is reduced at higher Z values. Chemical sputtering is obviously seen to be different for oxygen as compared with other two gases. Tailoring of the surface contact angle by choosing an appropriate plasma gas is also possible by tuning the time of exposure at a desired position in the reactor. A control over the contact angle will help in tuning the adsorption process for the biomolecules.
IV. CONCLUSION
The microwave assisted ECR plasma system, developed in the laboratory, is suitable for surface modification of nylon 6 as a representative polymer. The ECR plasma reactor so developed has been mapped for the nature of the plasma species, their energy and density using electrostatic probes, namely, SLP and DLP configuration. Plasma properties such as floating potential, plasma potential and ion energy have been determined using SLP configuration, whereas electron temperature and density have been determined using the SLP and DLP. Further, in order to get an idea about electron energy distribution inside the ECR plasma reactor, the Druyvesteyn distribution function has been used. It has been pointed out that the effective electron temperature increases with increasing distance from the ECR zone at a given operating pressures. SLP configuration has been seen to be efficient in deriving the bi-Maxwellian electron energy distribution. This is in congruence with the properties of ECR plasma. Moreover, the effective electron temperature obtained using the DLP is quite high (ranging between 14 and 24 eV) as compared to that derived from SLP measurements (ranging between 2 and 20 eV). From both these measurements, it is clear that the electron energy in ECR plasma through-out the reactor is sufficiently high to cause the surface modification of biocompatible polymers such as nylon 6. The electron density can therefore be controlled to alter the surface morphology by selecting a proper position in the reactor. Ar, H_{2} + N_{2}, and O_{2} plasmas of known plasma properties were impinged onto the nylon 6 surface individually in order to modify the surface microscopically. As the characteristic parameters of plasma species are sufficiently high to induce surface modification by keeping bulk of the polymer intact, surface modification is observed prominently. The modified surface has been examined using scanning electron microscopy and contact angle measurements. For resultant surface modification of nylon 6, total fluence received by the surface is one of the important factors which is decided by distance from the ECR zone and time of exposure.
