Photoreflectance and photoreflectance excitation study of optical transitions in GaAsBi/GaAs heterostructure
Photoreflectance (PR) and photoreflectance excitation (PRE) techniques are employed to investigate the optical properties of the GaAs_{1-}_{x}Bi_{x}(x =0%–3.7%)/GaAs heterostructure grown by molecular beam epitaxy. The relations between broadenings and intensities of E_{0} and E_{0} + Δ_{SO} transitions in PR as a function of Bi content are disclosed. Both PR and PRE experimental techniques independently show that the oscillator strength of the E_{0} + Δ_{SO} transition becomes larger compared to that of the fundamental gap as the Bi content increases. Such results suggest that the incorporation of Bi into GaAs leads to an increase of the effective masses for the spin-orbit split-off band.
I. INTRODUCTION
The highly mismatched semiconductor alloys obtained by performing isoelectronic doping of GaAs with Bi have received considerable attention due to their electronic and spintronic properties [1,2]. Incorporating a few percent of Bi into GaAs produces a large band gap reduction (∼90 meV %Bi) [3] and an increase of spin-orbit (SO) splitting energy (Δ_{SO}) [4]. These properties make GaAsBi suitable for a variety of potential longer wavelength optoelectronic applications, such as infrared light-emitting diodes [5], photodetectors [6], solar cells [7], terahertz [8], and spintronic devices [9]. This energy band modulation can be explained by the Valence Band Anti-Crossing model [3], which shows that restructuring of the valence band is introduced by resonant interaction between a Bi defect level and the valence band of GaAs. Moreover, the photoluminescence intensity of this material was found to be enhanced with an increase of Bi concentration up to ∼4.5% Bi, which is favorable for fabrication of light emitting devices [10]. However, for lower and higher Bi concentration than ∼4.5% Bi, it has been observed that the optical quality can significantly deteriorate due to the incorporation of Bi atoms into GaAs, which leads to formation of Bi pairs [1] and Bi-related point defects [11]. Such material imperfections would limit applications in optoelectronics devices. Therefore, a deeper understanding of the fundamental properties of GaAsBi is needed. Modulation techniques, such as contactless electroreflectance, photomodulated transmittance, and photoreflectance (PR), have been widely used to measure the optical transition energies of E_{0} and E_{0} + Δ_{SO} for GaAsBi [4,12–15]. Such modulation reflectance measurements can provide band gap information, as well as estimates of the relative oscillator strength of the optical transitions. Furthermore, the linewidth of the optical transitions is directly related to the material quality and alloy-related changes of the band structure [12]. Unusual broadening and intensity ratio between the E_{0} and E_{0} + Δ_{SO} transitions have been also reported for GaAs_{0.97}Bi_{0.03} epilayers [12] and GaInAsBi alloys [13]. However, the possible physical origin of the intensities ratio between the E_{0} + Δ_{SO} and E_{0} transitions was not discussed in their paper.
In addition, the PR signal has derivative-like spectra features, which is somehow difficult to be analyzed. Compared with PR measurement, photoreflectance excitation (PRE) measurements are taken with a fixed probe wavelength and a variable pump wavelength [16]. Since the PR modulation mechanism is from surface/interface band bending modulation introduced by electron-hole pairs generated by the pump light, thus the amplitude of the PRE signal depends on the number of pump photons generated within a space-charge layer near the surface/interface. Thus, the PRE spectrum is always considered to be related to the absorption spectrum, which can give more reliable information of band transitions. Moreover, the PRE spectrum can easily probe the signals above the bandgap transitions such as E_{0} + Δ_{SO} transition. Thus, the oscillator strength of E_{0} and E_{0} + Δ_{SO} transition can be obtained directly. So far, such kind of technique has never been used to study GaAsBi material systems.
The physical parameters of GaAsBi such as the effective masses are unclear so far. Even for theoretical calculations itself, there still exist a lot of controversies. For example, Habchi et_al [17] theoretically predicted that in GaAsBi the hole effective mass is expected to increase with Bi-concentration, while the electron effective mass should decrease with respect to the values in GaAs. Maspero et_al [18] reported a different calculation result: both heavy-hole and conduction bands (CB) show a slight decrease in effective mass with increasing bismuth concentration. However, recent experimental results which show an unexpected increase of the electron effective mass in GaAsBi [19,20] are in disagreement with their theoretical expectation. Hybridization effects between Bi-related levels and the CB states are considered to be responsible for the increase of the electron effective mass in GaAsBi [17].
In this paper, we present PR and PRE spectra of GaAs_{1–}_{x}Bi_{x} samples with different Bi compositions (x =0%–3.7%) and perform a detailed analysis of the broadening and intensities of E_{0} + Δ_{SO} and E_{0} optical transitions. Both experimental techniques confirmed that an increase of the intensity ratio between E_{0} + Δ_{SO} and the fundamental gap optical transitions is observed due to bismuth incorporation. Our investigation on the intensity ratio between the E_{0} + Δ_{SO} and E_{0} transitions of PR and PRE spectra can provide the information of the effective mass of the valence band and its split-off replica.
II. SAMPLES AND METHODS
Our samples were grown by molecular beam epitaxy on semi-insulating (001) GaAs substrates and the growth temperature varied from ∼360 °C to ∼410 °C. Each sample is composed of a ∼150 nm GaAs buffer layer, a 200∼450 nm GaAsBi epilayer, and a ∼5 nm thick GaAs cap layer. The Bi content was determined by combining x-ray diffraction and optical data. Our PR and PRE experiments were carried out by applying bright configuration [21] at room-temperature. The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1, where two monochromators of the PI Tri-Vista Spectrographs system are employed for the PR and PRE experiments. In this configuration, the sample is illuminated by white light from a tungsten–halogen lamp and the reflected light signal is detected through the second monochromator equipped with a Si Avalanche Photo Diode and a thermoelectrically cooled InGaAs photodetector. The pump light is generated by a supercontinuum light source (http://www.yslphotonics.com/) and a semiconductor 532 nm laser.
Both the white light and pump laser focus on the same spot with a size of ∼1 mm diameter on the sample. The reflected light signal measured by the detector has two components: unmodulated reflectance signals R and chopped signal ΔR, which is the change of reflectance under the laser pumping modulation. Both R and ΔR are measured with a SR830 lock-in amplifier tuned to the chopper frequency (∼140 Hz). Thus, the measured photoreflectance (PR) can be obtained by the formula as ΔR/R. The PRE spectra are recorded by measuring the signal ΔR as a function of energy from the pump light, which comes from the first monochromator. At the same time, the probe light energy is fixed at a PR spectral position where the dominant minimum or maximum of the PR spectrum is located.
III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Figure 2 shows the PR spectra of as-grown GaAs_{1−x}Bi_{x} layers for x = 0%, 0.4%, 0.8%, 2.6%, and 3.7%, measured at room temperature. This figure clearly shows that three main transitions occur at the E_{0} and E_{0} + Δ_{SO} optical transitions for GaAsBi, and at the E_{0} optical transition for the GaAs (∼1.42 eV). The E_{0} transition of GaAsBi shifts to a lower energy with increasing Bi concentration. This energy shift is in qualitative agreement with theoretical calculations and other reported experimental results [4]. We noticed that the intensity of the E_{0} + Δ_{SO} transition is gradually enhanced with an increase of Bi content, while it is barely observed in the GaAs sample.
For the GaAsBi/GaAs heterostructure, the PR signals from E_{0} and E_{0} + Δ_{SO} transition of GaAsBi are expected to be subject to the modulation of the build-in electric field at the surface of GaAsBi, whereas the observation of the PR signals (∼1.42 eV) associated with band gap transition in GaAs is from the interface of the GaAsBi/GaAs heterostructure [22]. With an increase of Bi content, the lineshape of the GaAs related PR signal becomes broader as compared to that of the clean substrate, reflecting higher disorder at the interface for samples with a higher Bi content. The disorder at the interface originated from the lattice mismatch between GaAsBi and GaAs. Meanwhile, the Franz-Keldysh Oscillations (FKOs) in the PR spectra above the bandgap of GaAs are clearly observed for sample GaAs_{0.996}Bi_{0.004} and GaAs_{0.963}Bi_{0.037}, respectively. The positions of the extrema of FKOs are labeled by the index numbers. It is worth noting that with an increase of Bi content, the lineshape becomes broadened and the intensities of PR transitions E_{0} and E_{0} + Δ_{SO} changed dramatically. In order to accurately estimate the broadening factor and the intensities of the E_{0} and E_{0} + Δ_{SO} transitions, the PR spectra are analyzed using the third derivative functional form (TDFF) available for the low-field regime. The third derivative line-shape was proposed by Aspnes [23] using the time-dependent perturbation theory. This can be written as
where R and ΔR are the reflectance spectrum and its variation under the laser modulation, C is the spectral amplitude, θ is the phase factor, Γ is the broadening factor, E_{g} is the critical point (CP) of the studied material, and the exponent m depends on the critical point (CP) of the material. PR spectra were taken at room temperature and m is set as 2.5.
The fitting curve in Fig. 3 (displayed as a red thick line) for the sample with Bi content 3.7% is obtained using Eq. (1). This figure clearly shows that three main transitions take place, which occur at the E_{0} and E_{0} + Δ_{SO} optical transitions from GaAsBi and at the E_{0} (GaAs) optical transition from the GaAs substrate. The experimental spectral features are matched very well with the fitted curve from Eq. (1), using a least-squares minimization procedure. In order to investigate further the evolution of the relative changes in the broadening and intensities between E_{0} and E_{0} + Δ_{SO} optical transitions for GaAsBi, the PR results were revisited. For this purpose, we used the Lorentzian lineshape as follows [24]:
The modulus of the PR resonance (lower dashed lines in Fig. 3) was calculated from Eq. (2), with the same parameters as those extracted from the fitting of the experimental data using Eq. (1). The positions of the Lorentzian peaks are exactly at the points of energy transition, whereas their areas below the curve directly reflect the oscillator strengths of the corresponding transitions. The values of the Full-Width at Half-Maximums (FWHM) extracted from the experimental PR spectra are shown in Fig. 4. As can be seen, the FWHM of the E_{0} + Δ_{SO} and E_{0} transitions are broadened as Bi is incorporated into GaAs and the intrinsic FWHM of E_{0} and E_{0} + Δ_{SO} transition in GaAs are ∼17 meV and ∼45 meV, respectively [12]. For GaAsBi alloys with a lower Bi content (≤0.4%), the broadening of the E_{0} + Δ_{SO} transition is larger than that of the E_{0} transition reflecting that the intrinsic broadening still plays a dominant role. However, with an increase of Bi content (≥0.8%), the FWHM of the E_{0} transition start to become larger than that of the E_{0} + Δ_{SO} transition. Such unusual behavior of the broadening of the E_{0} and E_{0} + Δ_{SO} transitions can be explained as follows:
First, alloy content inhomogeneity [4] due to the incorporation of Bi into GaAs can be expected to broaden both the E_{0} and the E_{0} + Δ_{SO} transitions. The broadening is clearly visible even for low Bi content (0.4%). Second, the HH-LH degeneration splits due to strain. Batool et_al [25] reported that the strained valence band HH-LH splitting increases with Bi content at a rate of ∼15 meV/Bi% (plotted for comparison as a green straight line in Fig. 4). Each individual HH and LH band with alloy content inhomogeneity can contribute to the broadening of the E_{0} transition. Nevertheless, the influence of strain on the broadening is of little importance for the E_{0} + Δ_{SO} transition. The third factor that influences the broadening of E_{0} optical transition is due to the Bi resonant states from the valence band perturbed by the Bi pair and cluster [1,11,26]. However, this factor is less important for the broadening of the E_{0} + Δ_{SO} transition. To sum up, the broadening of the E_{0} transition arises from the splitting of light and heavy hole bands with alloy disorder, as well as the contribution from the Bi resonant states introduced by Bi pairs and clusters. In contrast, the broadening of the E_{0} + Δ_{SO} transition is mainly caused by conventional alloy disorder. The calculation results [4] are consistent with our PR measurement qualitatively.
As mentioned above, the integrated area of modulus of the PR resonance is proportional to the PR oscillator strength of the optical transition. In order to obtain quantitative information, we introduce the relative PR oscillator strength which is the intensity ratio between the E_{0} + Δ_{SO} and E_{0} transitions [27]. The intensity ratio of the E_{0} + Δ_{SO} and E_{0} transitions changed drastically after Bi atoms are incorporated into the GaAs host (see Fig. 5). Measurements from Kudrawiec et_al [12] are also shown as a comparison, where the value of the ratio is ∼0.2 for 3% Bi concentration. Our results are rather close to that of Kudrawiec et_al Although there are a lot of literature studies about the photoreflectance spectra of GaAsBi, most of the works focus only on the transition energy of E_{0} + Δ_{SO} and E_{0} transition [4,25,28] Quite few research groups care about the broadening and the intensities between E_{0} and E_{0} + Δ_{SO} transition in GaAsBi. So their PR data are hard to compare our experimental results. But the trend of broadening and intensities ratio of E_{0} + Δ_{SO} and E_{0} transition in their papers are consistent with our result.
The origin of the increase in the oscillator strength of E_{0} + Δ_{SO} transitions compared to that of the E_{0} transition with Bi incorporation is due to an decrease of SO split-off band curvature, leading to an increase in the effective mass of the SO split-off band [27]. A similar relationship between the intensities of the E_{0} + Δ_{SO} and E_{0} transitions has been found in diluted nitride GaAsN epilayers [27]. Such results suggest that the incorporation of Bi into GaAs affects the heavy/light-hole and the SO split-off band structure differently and results in an increase the effective masses of the SO split-off band [29].
It is questioned whether the PR spectrum can provide the accurate information about the ratio between the oscillator strength of E_{0} + Δ_{SO} and E_{0} transition or not, because whether the PR signal from E_{0} + Δ_{SO} transition can be observed or not strongly depend on the samples [30,31]. In our case, the PR signals from E_{0} + Δ_{SO} transition of GaAs are too weak to be observed, while Turcotte et_al [27] and Kudrawiec et_al [12] reported that the ratio of the oscillator strength between E_{0} + Δ_{SO} and E_{0} transition in GaAs is ∼0.07 and ∼0.01, respectively. Thus by relying solely PR measurement, it is not reliable to claim that incorporation of Bi into GaAs can enhance the oscillator strength of E_{0} + Δ_{SO} transition compared to that of the fundamental gap transition, as what Kudrawiec et_al [12] have done in their paper. We need other proofs to crosscheck the conclusion achieved from PR measurement. In order to obtain more information about the oscillator strength of E_{0} + Δ_{SO} and the E_{0} transition for GaAsBi, we present the PRE spectra for the GaAsBi/GaAs with different Bi content [see Fig. 6(b)]. The positions of the fixed probe energy for the PRE spectra are denoted by arrows in Fig. 6(a).
It is noted that for the GaAs sample, when the pumped energy is fixed at E_{0} + Δ_{SO} (∼1.77 eV), the obtained PR intensities are lower than that where the pumped energy is located at the band gap of GaAs (Eg ∼ 1.42 eV). This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that higher energy excitation which has a larger absorption coefficient [32] always generates fewer pumped numbers of electron-hole pairs, leading to lower intensities of PR signals. However, with an increase of Bi content, the measured intensities of the PR signal where the pumped light with energy located at the energies of E_{0} + Δ_{SO} gradually become stronger than that where the pumped light with energy is tuned to the energies of the fundamental gap.
The intensity of PRE is a function of the sample temperature, the probe and pump power, the width of the depletion layer, the surface Fermi voltage, and the energy dependent absorption coefficient [33], which may differ widely from sample to sample. But for the same sample, all the above conditions remain exactly the same except for the energy dependent absorption coefficient. The number of the absorbed photos is I_{0} (1–e^{−αl})/ℏω, where I_{0} is the incident laser power, α is absorption coefficient, and l is the thickness of the GaAsBi epilayers. Due to the limited thickness of the GaAsBi epilayers (200–450 nm) and an increase of absorption coefficient [34] above the energy of E_{0} (GaAsBi), we found that when the laser energy is changed from E_{0} (GaAsBi) to E_{0} (GaAs), more carriers are photo-generated, leading to an increase of PRE intensities.
When the pumped laser energy is located at the band gap of GaAs, the same number of electron-hole pairs is generated for all GaAsBi/GaAs samples and hence, it is better to normalize the PRE spectra with different Bi contents by using the PRE's intensities pumped at the laser energy of E_{g}(GaAs). The normalize PRE spectra are displayed in Fig. 7(a). The PRE intensities at the energy of E_{0} + Δ_{SO} transition gradually become larger than that at the energy of E_{g} (GaAs) with an increase of Bi content. The relative intensities of the E_{0} + Δ_{SO} transition are defined as the ratio between the measured PR intensities where the pumped light energies locate at E_{0} + Δ_{SO} and the measured ones where the pumped light energies are fixed at E_{g} (GaAs). The relative intensities of E_{0} + Δ_{SO} transition versus Bi content are plotted as a curve in Fig. 7(b). Compared to Fig. 5, we found that two curves extracted from the PRE and PR measurement followed a similar trend, confirming that incorporation of Bi into GaAs indeed enhanced the absorption coefficient at energy of E_{0} + Δ_{SO} transition.
Habchi et_al [17] predicted that in GaAsBi the hole effective mass of the SO split-off band remained unchanged with an increase of Bi-concentration, while the hole effective mass of the valence band is increased with respect to the values in GaAs. Since the same conduction band is involved in both the E_{0} transition and its split-off replica, according to the conduction parabolic band model [35], the oscillator strength is proportional to μ^{3/2}, where μ is the reduced effective mass, theoretically we should find that incorporation of Bi into GaAs enhanced the oscillator strength of E_{0} transition compared to that of E_{0} + Δ_{SO} transition. On the contrary to their theoretical expectations, our PR and PRE experiments reveal that incorporation of Bi into GaAs enhanced the oscillator strength of E_{0} + Δ_{SO} transition compared to that of the fundamental gap transition. It means that a sizeable increase of the effective masses of the SO split-off band is expected. Their calculation results cannot fit our experimental observation. We also noted that recent theoretical investigations cannot explain the experimental results obtained by Pettinari et_al [19,20], who found an increase of the electron effective mass in GaAsBi [19,20]. The disagreement between experimental results and theoretical prediction indicates that further theoretical and experimental investigations of the peculiar properties of the dilute bismide semiconductor should be continued.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
Using a combination of PR and PRE measurements, we have investigated the band-structure properties of GaAsBi with different Bi compositions (x = 0%–3.7%) grown on GaAs. We observed unusual broadening and an increase of the intensity ratio between the E_{0} + Δ_{SO} and E_{0} optical transitions with an increase of Bi content by use of PR spectroscopy. Both PR and PRE experiments reveal that incorporation of Bi into GaAs enhanced the oscillator strength of E_{0} + Δ_{SO} transition compared to that of the fundamental gap transition. These results suggest that the incorporation of Bi into GaAs affects the heavy/light-hole and the SO split-off band structure differently and leads to an increase the effective mass of the SO split-off band. These conclusions are in disagreement with the recent theoretical investigations. Our results would provoke further theoretical and experimental investigations of the peculiar properties of the dilute bismide semiconductor.
