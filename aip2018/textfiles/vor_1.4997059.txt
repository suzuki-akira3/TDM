Coherence analysis of a class of weighted networks
This paper investigates consensus dynamics in a dynamical system with additive stochastic disturbances that is characterized as network coherence by using the Laplacian spectrum. We introduce a class of weighted networks based on a complete graph and investigate the first- and second-order network coherence quantifying as the sum and square sum of reciprocals of all nonzero Laplacian eigenvalues. First, the recursive relationship of its eigenvalues at two successive generations of Laplacian matrix is deduced. Then, we compute the sum and square sum of reciprocal of all nonzero Laplacian eigenvalues. The obtained results show that the scalings of first- and second-order coherence with network size obey four and five laws, respectively, along with the range of the weight factor. Finally, it indicates that the scalings of our studied networks are smaller than other studied networks when 1d<r≤1.
I. INTRODUCTION
Complex networks have infiltrated mathematical disciplines, many different domains such as life science and engineering disciplines. The scientific understanding of the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of complex networks has also become a very critical challenging issue in network research. One critical issue arising from distributed formation control and multi-agent systems is to develop distributed consensus, which is a relatively fundamental problem. The consensus dynamics of multi-agent systems has gained much attention [1]. Bamieh et_al proposed an asymptotic analysis of network coherence for the first- and second-order consensus algorithms in torus and lattice networks according to number of nodes and network dimension [2]. Then Patterson and Bamieh gave the first- and second-order consensus algorithms in networks with stochastic disturbances [3].
It is well known that it is extremely important to study the spectrum of Laplacian matrices of complex systems [4–8]. For the first-order and the second-order dynamics systems, it showed that this H_{2} norm can be distinguished by the trace of the pseudo-inverse of the Laplacian matrix [2,9,10] and also determined by the Laplacian spectrum, though in a mildly more complex way [2]. The consensus dynamics quantifying as network coherence that is characterized by Laplacian spectrum has been an burgeoning research topic, especially for some deterministic growing networks [3,11]. Ding et_al investigated the web graphs and obtained the scalings of their corresponding network coherence by using the Laplacian spectrum [11]. Sun et_al investigated a family of uniform recursive trees and consensus dynamics in a linear dynamical system with additive stochastic disturbances, which is characterized as network coherence by the Laplacian spectrum [12]. Dai et_al gave a further analysis of the Laplacian spectrum for some binary or weighted networks and obtained the scalings of network coherence [13,14]. These studies were focused on network coherence of the deterministic networks. The reason why they studied the deterministic networks is as follows.
Network models of complex systems cover two types of models: one is constructed by random methods and the other is constructed by deterministic methods. In the real world, stochastic model is a more appropriate characteristic of most of the networks. However, for the stochastic networks, it is difficult for the analytical determination of the Laplacian spectrum even by the numerical calculation of the Laplacian eigenvalues. Deterministic network models are constructed in a deterministic manner, reflecting the real system characteristics. Therefore, it has played a role in the promotion of the further study of stochastic models.
However, there is few research on weighted networks. Weighted networks are the extension of binary networks [15,16] in which each edge is associated with a variable, e.g., the edge (i, j) linking nodes i and j is associated with a variable ω_{ij}, called the weight. Practical realizations of weights in real networks range from the number of passengers traveling yearly between two airports in airport networks [17] to the traffic measured in packets per unit time between routers in the Internet [18] or the intensity of predator-prey interactions in ecosystems [19]. Hence it is necessary for a modeling approach that can capture the effects of weighted characteristics on complex dynamics. We believe that these innovations will open new perspectives for some studies based on binary networks.
Liu et_al introduced a class of binary small-world networks which are based on a complete graph consisting of d nodes. One complete graph has been widely used in quantum walks [20], social networks [21], tensor networks [22], and explosive percolation problem [23]. Notice that the dual Sierpinski gaskets embedded in (d − 1)-dimensional have exactly the same number of nodes and edges [24] as the weighted networks constructed in Ref [25]. It has been shown that these two models display rather different dynamic behavior though not without similarities [24,25]. Based on the model introduced by Ref [25], a class of weighted small-world networks, deterministic networks, are introduced by us. The innovation in this model is the use of the weight factor.
Our objective is to investigate the performance of systems with first- and second-order coherence dynamics with additive stochastic disturbances. We use an H_{2} norm as a measure of deviation from consensus, which thus quantifies a notion of network coherence. First, we deduce the recursive relationship of its eigenvalues at two successive generations of Laplacian matrix [25]. Then we compute the sum and square sum of reciprocals of all nonzero Laplacian eigenvalues. The obtained results show that the scalings of first-order coherence with network size obey four laws along with the range of the weight factor, and the scalings of second-order coherence with network size obey other four laws along with the range of the weight factor.
The organization of this paper is as follows. In Secs. II A and II B, we introduce the definition of network coherence. In Sec. III, we give the model of the weighted networks and compute the Laplacian eigenvalues and obtain the scalings of the first- and second-order network coherence. In Sec. IV, we draw the conclusions.
II. NETWORK COHERENCE
Considering the local, linear first-order consensus algorithms over a network modeled by a weighted network G with N nodes and E edges, we can denote the weighted adjacency matrix of G by W, and S=diag(s_{1},s_{2},…,s_{N}) is an intensity matrix. The Laplacian matrix of the network G is denoted by L and is defined as L = S − W. Our objective is to study the robustness of consensus algorithms when the nodes are subject to external perturbations and to analytically quantify the relationship between the system robustness and the topology. Networks capture this robustness using a quantity that we call network coherence. Next, in Secs. II A and II B, we will review the definition of network coherence in the system dynamics.
A. Coherence in networks with first-order dynamics
In the problem of the first-order consensus, at time t, each node j has a single state x_{j}(t), and the state of the overall system at time t which is given by the vector x(t)∈R^{N}. Each node state suffers stochastic disturbances and the goal is to let the nodes maintain consensus at the mean of their current states.
Dynamics of this system are given by
where ω(t) is an N-vector of independent Gaussian white noise stochastic processes, and L is the Laplacian matrix.
In the absence of the additive noise, as is well known that when the graph is connected, the state converges exponentially to a point on the consensus subspace that corresponds to the average value of the initial conditions. With the additive noise term, the state evolution becomes a stochastic process [26]. Network coherence quantifies the steady-state variance of these fluctuations, and it can be regarded as a measure of robustness of the consensus process to the additive noise. If networks with small steady-state variance have high network coherence, it can be regarded as more robust to noise than networks with low coherence [27].
One can obtain the variance of these fluctuations in the first-order consensus systems from the definition of network coherence.
The first-order network coherence is defined as the mean and steady-state variance of the deviation from the mean of the current nodes states
We define the output of the system (1) to be
where J is the projection operator J=I−1N11^{T}, with 1 the N-vector of all ones. It is well known that H_{FO} is given by the H_{2} norm of the system defined in (1) and (3),
Suppose L is the Laplacian matrix of connected graph with eigenvalues 0=λ_{1}<λ_{2}≤⋯≤λ_{N}. It has been proved that H_{FO} is fully determined by the Laplacian spectrum of L [2,9,10]. And then the first-order network coherence is
B. Coherence in networks with second-order dynamics
For the second-order consensus, each node j has two state variables x_{1,j}(t) and x_{2,j}(t)(j=1,2,…,N). The state of the whole system is captured in x_{1}(t) and x_{2}(t) that are all N-vectors. Nodes update their states based on local feedback (the states of their neighbors in the network), and they are also exposed to random external disturbances that enter through the x_{2}(t) terms. Thus, the system dynamics are
where w(t) is a 2N disturbance vector with zero-mean, uncorrelated second-order processes, and unit variance, and L is the Laplacian matrix.
In the problem of autonomous vehicle formation control [2], these system dynamics have been mentioned. According to Ref [2], x_{1}(t) involved the vehicle positions and x_{2}(t) involved the vehicle velocities. The vehicles make an attempt to maintain a specified formation traveling at a fixed velocity when subject to stochastic external perturbations. The nonzero entries of L assign the communication links of the formation, and the node i can observe the position and velocity of node j if L_{i,j} = −1. It has revealed that similar system dynamics also appear in power networks [28].
According to x_{1}(t), the network coherence in the second-order system (6) is defined and just as the first-order coherence, it can obtain the deviation from the average of x_{1}(t). The second-order network coherence is the mean, steady-state variance of the deviation from the average of x_{1}(t)
We define the output for the system (6) as
where J is also the projection operator and the second-order network coherence is given by the H_{2} norm of the system that defined by Eqs. (6) and (8). Then, the value is also fully determined by the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix [2]. Thus
III. NETWORK COHERENCE OF THE WEIGHTED NETWORKS
Ideally, one would like to find an analytical expression for network coherence that depends on the graph topology. While it is difficult to characterize the Laplacian spectrum for a general network or networks with a special structure, it is sometimes possible to find a closed form for the either the sum or for the square sum of reciprocals of all nonzero Laplacian eigenvalues. In this section, we introduce a class of weighted networks and investigate the coherence by computing the recursion formula for the Laplacian spectrum [29–33].
A. Model
Deterministic networks have many important advantages. People can analyze the networks features, such as the degree distribution, cluster coefficient, average path length, degree of correlation, and spectral properties. The results can be used to verify the correctness of random models and methods. Therefore, it has played a role in the promotion of the further study of stochastic models. Next we give the model structure of Ggd.
We start with a brief introduction to a class of weighted networks Ggd characterized by two parameters d and g, where d stands for the number of nodes of initial complete graph and g stands for the number of iterations. Figure 1 shows the construction process from G13 to G33. At first, G1d is a complete graph with d nodes and each edge of G1d has unitary weight. For g≥2, the Ggd is constructed as follows. Each node in Gg−1d is replaced by a copy of G1d whose weighted edges have been scaled by a factor r^{g−1}(0<r≤1). Here we call r the weight factor. From the construction of Ggd, it can obtain the number of nodes in this network which is
and the number of edges which is
This kind of weighted networks introduced here is based on complete graph consisting of d nodes. Paper  [24] has shown that the average clustering coefficient of all the nodes is
and this kind of networks is similar to complete graphs in the limit of d→∞ [24]. That is to say, there are some connections between our networks and complete graphs. For some large complex networks which have some links to complete graphs (as we have given here that this kind of network is similar to complete graphs only in the limit d→∞), we can use the relevant properties of the complete graphs to study the performance of the networks. This will provide a more convenient and effective solution to some models.
B. Laplacian eigenvalues for the weighted networks
Denote by ω_{ij} the weight of edge linking node i and node j. Let W_{g}=(Wij){d^{g}×d^{g}} be the generalized adjacency matrix (weight matrix) of Ggd, where W_{ij}=W_{ji}=ω_{ij} if nodes i and j are adjacent, ω_{ij}=ω_{ji}=0 otherwise, then the strength of node i is s_{i}=Σ_{j∈Ggd}ω_{ij},(i=1,2,…,d^{g}). Let S_{g}=diag(s_{1},s_{2},…,s_{d^{g}}) denote the diagonal intensity matrix of Ggd, then the Laplacian matrix of Ggd is defined by L_{g} = S_{g} − W_{g}.
Then we will obtain the solutions for the eigenvalues of L_{g} by giving the characteristic polynomial for the Laplacian matrix of Ggd.
Following from the construction of Ggd, the weight matrix W_{g}, the strength matrix S_{g}, and the Laplacian matrix L_{g} (see Table I) can be expressed as follows.
The characteristic polynomial of L_{g} can be determined as
From Table II, we can obtain
So the characteristic polynomial for the Laplacian eigenvalues of L_{g} is
The recursion relation provided in Eq. (19) determines the eigenvalues of Laplacian matrix for Ggd. It is obvious that Ggd has d^{g} Laplacian eigenvalues, denoted by λ1(g),λ2(g),…,λd^{g}(g), the set of which can be represented by Λ_{g}, i.e., Λ_{g}={λ1(g),λ2(g),…,λd^{g}(g)}. And without loss of generality, we can assume that λ1(g)≤λ2(g)≤⋯≤λd^{g}(g). It is show that Pgd(λ) has the root λ=dr^{g−1} with multiplicity at least (d−2)d^{g−1} from Eq. (19). From above analysis, Λ_{g} can be divided into two subsets Λg(1) and Λg(2) satisfying Λ_{g}=Λg(1)∪Λg(2), where
and Λg(2) includes the rest of 2d^{g−1} eigenvalues that are determined by det(λ(λ−dr^{g−1})I−(λ−r^{g−1})L)=0. The 2d^{g−1} eigenvalues can be expressed as Λg(2)={λ̃1(g),λ̃2(g),…,λ̃2d^{g−1}(g)}. From Eq. (16) and d≥3, it follows that
That is each of the eigenvalue λ≠r^{g−1}. So the equation det(λ(λ−dr^{g−1})I−(λ−r^{g−1})L)=0 can be written as det(λ(λ−dr^{g−1})λ−r^{g−1}I−L)=0.
By giving the characteristic polynomial of L_{g} that leads to N_{g−1} eigenvalues Λ_{g−1}={λ1(g−1),λ2(g−1),…,λd^{g−1}(g−1)}, the set Λg(2) follows from
That is
or
where i is from 1 to d^{g−1}.
Solving the quadratic Eq. (22), we can obtain two roots λ̃2i−1(g)=r_{1}(λi(g−1)) and λ̃2(g)=r_{2}(λi(g−1))(i=1,2,…,d^{g−1}), then r_{1}(λi(g−1)) and r_{2}(λi(g−1)) are
Therefore, each eigenvalue λi(g−1)(i=1,2,…,d^{g−1}) of Λ_{g−1} generates two eigenvalues in Λg(2) by inserting each Laplacian eigenvalue of G_{g−1} into Eq. (25). And then, considering the initial value Λ_{1}={0,dr^{g−1},dr^{g−1},…,dr^{g−1}︸d−1}, by recursively applying Eq. (25) and adding Λg(1), the Laplacian eigenvalues of G_{g} are fully determined.
C. The network coherence of the weighted networks
In Subsection III B, it has obtained the recursion formula for the Laplacian spectrum, and it is not hard to see that each step has one eigenvalue which equals to zero from the initial value and Eq. (25). In addition, it shows that r_{1}(λ1(g−1))=0 and r_{2}(λ1(g−1))=dr^{g−1}, where λ1(g−1)=0. Next, from the definition of network coherence, the first- and second-order network coherence can be calculated as follows:
1. First-order network coherence
Then, we have the following recursion formula:
Next, considering the initial value S_{1}=d−1d and we will give a classified discussion about the weight factor r.
Case 1: r = 1
If r = 1, from Eq. (27), we obtain the sum of the reciprocal of eigenvalues at step g which is
Case 2: r = 1/d
If r=1d, from Eq. (27), we obtain
Case 3: 0 < r < 1/d or 1/d < r < 1
If 0 < r < 1/d or 1/d < r < 1, according to Eq. (27), we can obtain
Then, according to Eq. (5), we have
Thus, for large weighted networks (i.e., N_{g}→∞), we can get the first-order network coherence as follows:
where C(d, r) is a constant related to d and r.
2. Second-order network coherence
Then, we have the recursion formula
Next, considering the initial value 2/d^{2}, we will give a classified discussion about the weight factor r.
Case 1: r = 1
If r = 1, from Eqs. (27) and (33), we can obtain
Case 2: r = 1/d
If r = 1/d, from Eqs. (27) and (33), we can obtain
Case 3: r = 1/d^{2}
If r = 1/d^{2}, from Eqs. (27) and (33), we can obtain
Case 4: r=1/d
If r=1/d, from (27) and (33), we can obtain
Case 5: 0 < r < 1/d^{2} or 1/d^{2} < r < 1/d or 1/d<r<1/d or 1/d<r<1
If r satisfies the above condition, similarly, we can obtain
Then, according to Eq. (9), we have
Finally, for large weighted networks (i.e., N_{g}→∞), the second-order coherence of the weighted networks with scale size can be summarized as follows from five cases above:
We note that for this class of weighted networks studied in this paper, the scalings of the coherence for both first- and second-order systems have different results when the range of the weight factor r is different (see Table III). Here giving an example of d = 3, we can find that the scaling of the first-order coherence decreases with the increasing of r when 0<r≤1. And the scaling of the second-order coherence decreases with the increasing of r under condition of 0 < r < 1 and H_{SO}∼N_{g}lnN_{g} when r = 1 (see Fig. 2).
IV. CONCLUSIONS
In summary, this paper introduced a class of weighted networks based on a complete graph. For the weighted networks, we reviewed the definition of the first- and second-order network coherence. In order to find a closed from for the sum and square sum of reciprocal of all nonzero Laplacian eigenvalues, this paper deduced the recursive relationship of its eigenvalues at two successive generations of weighted matrix and then investigated the coherence by computing the recursion formula for the Laplacian spectrum. The obtained results show that the scalings of first-order coherence with network size obey four laws along with the range of the weight factor, and the scalings of second-order coherence with network size obey five laws along with the range of the weight factor.
It is well known that network coherence quantifies the steady-state variance of these fluctuations, and it can be regarded as a measure of robustness of the consensus process to the additive noise. If networks with small steady-state variance have high network coherence, it can be regarded as more robust to noise than networks with low coherence. Then, compared with other studied networks (see Tables III and IV), the scalings of our studied weighted networks are smaller when 1d<r≤1, which means the coherence of this networks is better when weight factor satisfies the above conditions.
A fundamental issue in the study of complex systems is to unveil how the structure properties affect various dynamics, many of which are related to the exact knowledge of the Laplacian spectrum. However, there are few research on weighted networks. The innovation in this paper is the use of the weight factor. This paper introduces a class of weighted networks characterized by three parameters r, d, and g which represent weight factor, number of initial nodes, and the number of iterations, respectively. Our objective is to quantify the robustness of algorithms to stochastic disturbances at the nodes by using a quantity called network coherence. For the weighted networks, we investigate the first- and second-order network coherence quantifying as the sum and square sum of reciprocals of all nonzero Laplacian eigenvalues by identifying the recursive relationship of its eigenvalues at two successive generations of the Laplacian matrix. Finally, the obtained results show that the scalings of first- and second-order coherence with network size obey four and five laws along with the range of the weight factor.
Complex networks have infiltrated mathematical disciplines, many different domains such as life science and engineering disciplines. The scientific understanding of the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of complex networks has also become a very critical challenging issue in network research. One critical issue arising from distributed formation control and multi-agent systems is to develop distributed consensus, which is a relatively fundamental problem. The consensus dynamics of multi-agent systems has gained much attention [1]. Bamieh et_al proposed an asymptotic analysis of network coherence for the first- and second-order consensus algorithms in torus and lattice networks according to number of nodes and network dimension [2]. Then Patterson and Bamieh gave the first- and second-order consensus algorithms in networks with stochastic disturbances [3].
It is well known that it is extremely important to study the spectrum of Laplacian matrices of complex systems [4–8]. For the first-order and the second-order dynamics systems, it showed that this H_{2} norm can be distinguished by the trace of the pseudo-inverse of the Laplacian matrix [2,9,10] and also determined by the Laplacian spectrum, though in a mildly more complex way [2]. The consensus dynamics quantifying as network coherence that is characterized by Laplacian spectrum has been an burgeoning research topic, especially for some deterministic growing networks [3,11]. Ding et_al investigated the web graphs and obtained the scalings of their corresponding network coherence by using the Laplacian spectrum [11]. Sun et_al investigated a family of uniform recursive trees and consensus dynamics in a linear dynamical system with additive stochastic disturbances, which is characterized as network coherence by the Laplacian spectrum [12]. Dai et_al gave a further analysis of the Laplacian spectrum for some binary or weighted networks and obtained the scalings of network coherence [13,14]. These studies were focused on network coherence of the deterministic networks. The reason why they studied the deterministic networks is as follows.
Network models of complex systems cover two types of models: one is constructed by random methods and the other is constructed by deterministic methods. In the real world, stochastic model is a more appropriate characteristic of most of the networks. However, for the stochastic networks, it is difficult for the analytical determination of the Laplacian spectrum even by the numerical calculation of the Laplacian eigenvalues. Deterministic network models are constructed in a deterministic manner, reflecting the real system characteristics. Therefore, it has played a role in the promotion of the further study of stochastic models.
However, there is few research on weighted networks. Weighted networks are the extension of binary networks [15,16] in which each edge is associated with a variable, e.g., the edge (i, j) linking nodes i and j is associated with a variable ω_{ij}, called the weight. Practical realizations of weights in real networks range from the number of passengers traveling yearly between two airports in airport networks [17] to the traffic measured in packets per unit time between routers in the Internet [18] or the intensity of predator-prey interactions in ecosystems [19]. Hence it is necessary for a modeling approach that can capture the effects of weighted characteristics on complex dynamics. We believe that these innovations will open new perspectives for some studies based on binary networks.
Liu et_al introduced a class of binary small-world networks which are based on a complete graph consisting of d nodes. One complete graph has been widely used in quantum walks [20], social networks [21], tensor networks [22], and explosive percolation problem [23]. Notice that the dual Sierpinski gaskets embedded in (d − 1)-dimensional have exactly the same number of nodes and edges [24] as the weighted networks constructed in Ref [25]. It has been shown that these two models display rather different dynamic behavior though not without similarities [24,25]. Based on the model introduced by Ref [25], a class of weighted small-world networks, deterministic networks, are introduced by us. The innovation in this model is the use of the weight factor.
Our objective is to investigate the performance of systems with first- and second-order coherence dynamics with additive stochastic disturbances. We use an H_{2} norm as a measure of deviation from consensus, which thus quantifies a notion of network coherence. First, we deduce the recursive relationship of its eigenvalues at two successive generations of Laplacian matrix [25]. Then we compute the sum and square sum of reciprocals of all nonzero Laplacian eigenvalues. The obtained results show that the scalings of first-order coherence with network size obey four laws along with the range of the weight factor, and the scalings of second-order coherence with network size obey other four laws along with the range of the weight factor.
The organization of this paper is as follows. In Secs. II A and II B, we introduce the definition of network coherence. In Sec. III, we give the model of the weighted networks and compute the Laplacian eigenvalues and obtain the scalings of the first- and second-order network coherence. In Sec. IV, we draw the conclusions.
Considering the local, linear first-order consensus algorithms over a network modeled by a weighted network G with N nodes and E edges, we can denote the weighted adjacency matrix of G by W, and S=diag(s_{1},s_{2},…,s_{N}) is an intensity matrix. The Laplacian matrix of the network G is denoted by L and is defined as L = S − W. Our objective is to study the robustness of consensus algorithms when the nodes are subject to external perturbations and to analytically quantify the relationship between the system robustness and the topology. Networks capture this robustness using a quantity that we call network coherence. Next, in Secs. II A and II B, we will review the definition of network coherence in the system dynamics.
In the problem of the first-order consensus, at time t, each node j has a single state x_{j}(t), and the state of the overall system at time t which is given by the vector x(t)∈R^{N}. Each node state suffers stochastic disturbances and the goal is to let the nodes maintain consensus at the mean of their current states.
Dynamics of this system are given by
where ω(t) is an N-vector of independent Gaussian white noise stochastic processes, and L is the Laplacian matrix.
In the absence of the additive noise, as is well known that when the graph is connected, the state converges exponentially to a point on the consensus subspace that corresponds to the average value of the initial conditions. With the additive noise term, the state evolution becomes a stochastic process [26]. Network coherence quantifies the steady-state variance of these fluctuations, and it can be regarded as a measure of robustness of the consensus process to the additive noise. If networks with small steady-state variance have high network coherence, it can be regarded as more robust to noise than networks with low coherence [27].
One can obtain the variance of these fluctuations in the first-order consensus systems from the definition of network coherence.
The first-order network coherence is defined as the mean and steady-state variance of the deviation from the mean of the current nodes states
We define the output of the system (1) to be
where J is the projection operator J=I−1N11^{T}, with 1 the N-vector of all ones. It is well known that H_{FO} is given by the H_{2} norm of the system defined in (1) and (3),
Suppose L is the Laplacian matrix of connected graph with eigenvalues 0=λ_{1}<λ_{2}≤⋯≤λ_{N}. It has been proved that H_{FO} is fully determined by the Laplacian spectrum of L [2,9,10]. And then the first-order network coherence is
For the second-order consensus, each node j has two state variables x_{1,j}(t) and x_{2,j}(t)(j=1,2,…,N). The state of the whole system is captured in x_{1}(t) and x_{2}(t) that are all N-vectors. Nodes update their states based on local feedback (the states of their neighbors in the network), and they are also exposed to random external disturbances that enter through the x_{2}(t) terms. Thus, the system dynamics are
where w(t) is a 2N disturbance vector with zero-mean, uncorrelated second-order processes, and unit variance, and L is the Laplacian matrix.
In the problem of autonomous vehicle formation control [2], these system dynamics have been mentioned. According to Ref [2], x_{1}(t) involved the vehicle positions and x_{2}(t) involved the vehicle velocities. The vehicles make an attempt to maintain a specified formation traveling at a fixed velocity when subject to stochastic external perturbations. The nonzero entries of L assign the communication links of the formation, and the node i can observe the position and velocity of node j if L_{i,j} = −1. It has revealed that similar system dynamics also appear in power networks [28].
According to x_{1}(t), the network coherence in the second-order system (6) is defined and just as the first-order coherence, it can obtain the deviation from the average of x_{1}(t). The second-order network coherence is the mean, steady-state variance of the deviation from the average of x_{1}(t)
We define the output for the system (6) as
where J is also the projection operator and the second-order network coherence is given by the H_{2} norm of the system that defined by Eqs. (6) and (8). Then, the value is also fully determined by the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix [2]. Thus
Ideally, one would like to find an analytical expression for network coherence that depends on the graph topology. While it is difficult to characterize the Laplacian spectrum for a general network or networks with a special structure, it is sometimes possible to find a closed form for the either the sum or for the square sum of reciprocals of all nonzero Laplacian eigenvalues. In this section, we introduce a class of weighted networks and investigate the coherence by computing the recursion formula for the Laplacian spectrum [29–33].
Deterministic networks have many important advantages. People can analyze the networks features, such as the degree distribution, cluster coefficient, average path length, degree of correlation, and spectral properties. The results can be used to verify the correctness of random models and methods. Therefore, it has played a role in the promotion of the further study of stochastic models. Next we give the model structure of Ggd.
We start with a brief introduction to a class of weighted networks Ggd characterized by two parameters d and g, where d stands for the number of nodes of initial complete graph and g stands for the number of iterations. Figure 1 shows the construction process from G13 to G33. At first, G1d is a complete graph with d nodes and each edge of G1d has unitary weight. For g≥2, the Ggd is constructed as follows. Each node in Gg−1d is replaced by a copy of G1d whose weighted edges have been scaled by a factor r^{g−1}(0<r≤1). Here we call r the weight factor. From the construction of Ggd, it can obtain the number of nodes in this network which is
and the number of edges which is
This kind of weighted networks introduced here is based on complete graph consisting of d nodes. Paper  [24] has shown that the average clustering coefficient of all the nodes is
and this kind of networks is similar to complete graphs in the limit of d→∞ [24]. That is to say, there are some connections between our networks and complete graphs. For some large complex networks which have some links to complete graphs (as we have given here that this kind of network is similar to complete graphs only in the limit d→∞), we can use the relevant properties of the complete graphs to study the performance of the networks. This will provide a more convenient and effective solution to some models.
Denote by ω_{ij} the weight of edge linking node i and node j. Let W_{g}=(Wij){d^{g}×d^{g}} be the generalized adjacency matrix (weight matrix) of Ggd, where W_{ij}=W_{ji}=ω_{ij} if nodes i and j are adjacent, ω_{ij}=ω_{ji}=0 otherwise, then the strength of node i is s_{i}=Σ_{j∈Ggd}ω_{ij},(i=1,2,…,d^{g}). Let S_{g}=diag(s_{1},s_{2},…,s_{d^{g}}) denote the diagonal intensity matrix of Ggd, then the Laplacian matrix of Ggd is defined by L_{g} = S_{g} − W_{g}.
Then we will obtain the solutions for the eigenvalues of L_{g} by giving the characteristic polynomial for the Laplacian matrix of Ggd.
Following from the construction of Ggd, the weight matrix W_{g}, the strength matrix S_{g}, and the Laplacian matrix L_{g} (see Table I) can be expressed as follows.
The characteristic polynomial of L_{g} can be determined as
From Table II, we can obtain
So the characteristic polynomial for the Laplacian eigenvalues of L_{g} is
The recursion relation provided in Eq. (19) determines the eigenvalues of Laplacian matrix for Ggd. It is obvious that Ggd has d^{g} Laplacian eigenvalues, denoted by λ1(g),λ2(g),…,λd^{g}(g), the set of which can be represented by Λ_{g}, i.e., Λ_{g}={λ1(g),λ2(g),…,λd^{g}(g)}. And without loss of generality, we can assume that λ1(g)≤λ2(g)≤⋯≤λd^{g}(g). It is show that Pgd(λ) has the root λ=dr^{g−1} with multiplicity at least (d−2)d^{g−1} from Eq. (19). From above analysis, Λ_{g} can be divided into two subsets Λg(1) and Λg(2) satisfying Λ_{g}=Λg(1)∪Λg(2), where
and Λg(2) includes the rest of 2d^{g−1} eigenvalues that are determined by det(λ(λ−dr^{g−1})I−(λ−r^{g−1})L)=0. The 2d^{g−1} eigenvalues can be expressed as Λg(2)={λ̃1(g),λ̃2(g),…,λ̃2d^{g−1}(g)}. From Eq. (16) and d≥3, it follows that
That is each of the eigenvalue λ≠r^{g−1}. So the equation det(λ(λ−dr^{g−1})I−(λ−r^{g−1})L)=0 can be written as det(λ(λ−dr^{g−1})λ−r^{g−1}I−L)=0.
By giving the characteristic polynomial of L_{g} that leads to N_{g−1} eigenvalues Λ_{g−1}={λ1(g−1),λ2(g−1),…,λd^{g−1}(g−1)}, the set Λg(2) follows from
That is
or
where i is from 1 to d^{g−1}.
Solving the quadratic Eq. (22), we can obtain two roots λ̃2i−1(g)=r_{1}(λi(g−1)) and λ̃2(g)=r_{2}(λi(g−1))(i=1,2,…,d^{g−1}), then r_{1}(λi(g−1)) and r_{2}(λi(g−1)) are
Therefore, each eigenvalue λi(g−1)(i=1,2,…,d^{g−1}) of Λ_{g−1} generates two eigenvalues in Λg(2) by inserting each Laplacian eigenvalue of G_{g−1} into Eq. (25). And then, considering the initial value Λ_{1}={0,dr^{g−1},dr^{g−1},…,dr^{g−1}︸d−1}, by recursively applying Eq. (25) and adding Λg(1), the Laplacian eigenvalues of G_{g} are fully determined.
In Subsection III B, it has obtained the recursion formula for the Laplacian spectrum, and it is not hard to see that each step has one eigenvalue which equals to zero from the initial value and Eq. (25). In addition, it shows that r_{1}(λ1(g−1))=0 and r_{2}(λ1(g−1))=dr^{g−1}, where λ1(g−1)=0. Next, from the definition of network coherence, the first- and second-order network coherence can be calculated as follows:
Then, we have the following recursion formula:
Next, considering the initial value S_{1}=d−1d and we will give a classified discussion about the weight factor r.
Case 1: r = 1
If r = 1, from Eq. (27), we obtain the sum of the reciprocal of eigenvalues at step g which is
Case 2: r = 1/d
If r=1d, from Eq. (27), we obtain
Case 3: 0 < r < 1/d or 1/d < r < 1
If 0 < r < 1/d or 1/d < r < 1, according to Eq. (27), we can obtain
Then, according to Eq. (5), we have
Thus, for large weighted networks (i.e., N_{g}→∞), we can get the first-order network coherence as follows:
where C(d, r) is a constant related to d and r.
Then, we have the recursion formula
Next, considering the initial value 2/d^{2}, we will give a classified discussion about the weight factor r.
Case 1: r = 1
If r = 1, from Eqs. (27) and (33), we can obtain
Case 2: r = 1/d
If r = 1/d, from Eqs. (27) and (33), we can obtain
Case 3: r = 1/d^{2}
If r = 1/d^{2}, from Eqs. (27) and (33), we can obtain
Case 4: r=1/d
If r=1/d, from (27) and (33), we can obtain
Case 5: 0 < r < 1/d^{2} or 1/d^{2} < r < 1/d or 1/d<r<1/d or 1/d<r<1
If r satisfies the above condition, similarly, we can obtain
Then, according to Eq. (9), we have
Finally, for large weighted networks (i.e., N_{g}→∞), the second-order coherence of the weighted networks with scale size can be summarized as follows from five cases above:
We note that for this class of weighted networks studied in this paper, the scalings of the coherence for both first- and second-order systems have different results when the range of the weight factor r is different (see Table III). Here giving an example of d = 3, we can find that the scaling of the first-order coherence decreases with the increasing of r when 0<r≤1. And the scaling of the second-order coherence decreases with the increasing of r under condition of 0 < r < 1 and H_{SO}∼N_{g}lnN_{g} when r = 1 (see Fig. 2).
In summary, this paper introduced a class of weighted networks based on a complete graph. For the weighted networks, we reviewed the definition of the first- and second-order network coherence. In order to find a closed from for the sum and square sum of reciprocal of all nonzero Laplacian eigenvalues, this paper deduced the recursive relationship of its eigenvalues at two successive generations of weighted matrix and then investigated the coherence by computing the recursion formula for the Laplacian spectrum. The obtained results show that the scalings of first-order coherence with network size obey four laws along with the range of the weight factor, and the scalings of second-order coherence with network size obey five laws along with the range of the weight factor.
It is well known that network coherence quantifies the steady-state variance of these fluctuations, and it can be regarded as a measure of robustness of the consensus process to the additive noise. If networks with small steady-state variance have high network coherence, it can be regarded as more robust to noise than networks with low coherence. Then, compared with other studied networks (see Tables III and IV), the scalings of our studied weighted networks are smaller when 1d<r≤1, which means the coherence of this networks is better when weight factor satisfies the above conditions.
