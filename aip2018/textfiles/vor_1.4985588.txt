Infinite-layer phase formation in the Ca_{1–}_{x}Sr_{x}CuO_{2} system by reactive molecular beam epitaxy
We synthesized thin films of the thermodynamically unstable infinite-layer compound Ca_{1–x}Sr_{x}CuO_{2} by reactive molecular beam epitaxy and established thermodynamic boundary conditions that allow for the minimization of impurity phases and defects. In particular, the choice of radio-frequency oxygen plasma as an oxidizing agent as well as diverse substrate materials has been found to limit the stability region in a way that is comparable to the synthesis temperature. We employed scanning transmission electron microscopy to gain microscopic information and feedback on the formation behavior of the infinite layer phase. Moreover, we find that minute variations of the oxidizing power coerce strong responses, i.e., termination of the formation of the infinite layer phase.
INTRODUCTION
The infinite-layer compound MCuO_{2} (M = alkaline earth elements) has attracted considerable attention as this structure contains only the building blocks believed to be vital for superconductivity, i.e., CuO_{2} planes, and any cuprate superconductor is a derivative of the infinite-layer phase. Recently, the formation of infinite-layer phases has also been reported for other complex transition metal oxides, e.g., LaNiO_{2} [1] and SrFeO_{2} [2], though neither of them shows superconductivity. For Cu, the structure contains planar CuO_{2} layers sandwiched by double M cation layers and can be regarded as the essence of the A_{2}B_{2}Ca_{n}_{–1}Cu_{n}O_{4 + 2}_{n} (A = Bi or Tl; B = Ca, Sr, or Ba with n =1, 2, 3, and 4) superconductors. However, any extensive investigative effort has been hampered by the fact that infinite-layer cuprates present a thermodynamically unstable phase and one is therefore limited to stabilize this phase as powder under high pressures (>4 GPa). The fact that high pressure synthesis techniques are mandatory also holds for electron doped infinite-layer cuprate samples, i.e., substitution of Ca, Sr, and Ba by La and Nd. Takano et_al [8,9] synthesized infinite-layer cuprates over a wide range of synthesis conditions and compositions, and superconductivity was found for Sr_{1–}_{x}Nd_{x}CuO_{2} [10], Sr_{1–}_{x}La_{x}CuO_{2} [11], and (Sr_{0.7}Ca_{0.3})_{0.9}CuO_{2} [12,13]. These materials are bulk superconductors for a narrow composition range and conditions of oxygen pressure, temperature, reaction time, and cooling rate. Instead of high-pressure synthesis techniques, epitaxial stabilization was found to be effective in stabilizing the infinite-layer phase of cuprates. In particular, for electron-doped Sr_{1–}_{x}La_{x}CuO_{2}, the method of molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) proofed to be capable of synthesizing single crystal thin films with resistivity values as low as 80 μΩ cm at 300 K with superconducting transition temperatures (T_{c}) above 40 K [15]. While the superconductivity in electron-doped cuprates is a bulk-phenomenon, skepticism appeared when Castro et_al [16] synthesized superlattices of CaCuO_{2} and SrTiO_{3}. Their investigations revealed that the observed superconductivity is associated with polarization present at the interfaces and is therefore similar to the well-known SrTiO_{3}/LaAlO_{3} interface superconductivity [17]. Before starting the synthesis of infinite layer cuprates, one should carefully select the synthesis method. The ultimate tool for the synthesis of any complex transition metal oxide is molecular beam epitaxy [18–20]. In particular, superconducting cuprates grown by MBE are known to provide top tier electronic performances [21,22] and those properties can be thoroughly tuned [23]. Generally, synthesizing complex transition metal oxides demands for exacting stoichiometry and temperature control in order to suppress thermodynamically competing phases. For the SrO-CuO-CaO system, several crystal structures with various copper coordinations are in close proximity (see Fig. 1) and only limited synthesis conditions allow for the growth of infinite layer cuprates, where copper ions are square-planar coordinated. In Table I, we compare the crystallographic dimensions of copper oxides found for the SrO-CuO-CaO systems and only the infinite-layer phase is tetragonal with infinite slabs of CuO_{2}. Theoretical considerations into the infinite-layer-CaCuO_{2} phase and its electron doped versions [24,25] may provide a hint that it is an antiferromagnetic insulator and this antiferromagnetic state diminishes upon heavy electron doping (x ≈0.45). We challenge this statement in our manuscript by demonstrating that the absence of superconductivity in infinite-layer cuprate systems is a consequence of defects and the function of dopants is to quench charge imbalances that originate from defects in the CuO_{2} planes. To avoid the formation of coexisting or competing phases, we first discuss the thermodynamic phase diagrams of the CaO-CuO, SrO-CuO, CaO-SrO-CuO, and BaO-CuO ternary and quaternary systems. This discussion is followed by a detailed presentation of the growth technique by MBE before we present our results.
Ca-Cu-O phases
One of the first reported phases in the CaO-CuO system was CaCu_{2}O_{3} [26], and the X-ray diffraction analysis by Teske et_al [27] showed that Cu^{2+} ions are square-planar coordinated in a D2h13−Pmmm space group. However, the infinite-layer phase was not reported until the dawn of high-temperature superconductivity [28]. Until this point, many different Ca_{x}Cu_{y}O_{z} phases have been reported and we plot them in a thermodynamic phase diagram (Fig. 2). Owing to the complexity of the CaO-CuO system [29], several three (lines) and four (intersections) phase equilibria appear and one should keep in mind that not every apparent line-crossings de facto represent four-phase equilibria. For example, it was found that the Gibbs energy of the reaction Ca_{2}CuO_{3} + CuO = CaCu_{2}O_{3} is very small and the p_{O2}(T) curves for the three-phase fields involving CaCu_{2}O_{3} + Ca_{2}CuO_{3} and CaCu_{2}O_{3} + CuO cannot be distinguished [30,31]. Another compound, Ca_{0.83}CuO_{1.93} (generally written as Ca_{1–}_{x}CuO_{2–}_{δ}), was reported by Roth et_al [32,33] in the CaO-CuO phase diagram, and this phase appeared to be stable only at low temperatures. Ca_{1–}_{x}CuO_{2–}_{δ} decomposes into Ca_{2}CuO_{3} and CuO while oxygen is released at temperatures above 700 °C, and its crystal structure has been studied by X-ray diffraction [34–36], neutron diffraction, and electron diffraction and microscopy [37,38]. For Ca_{1–}_{x}CuO_{2–}_{δ}, a situation where Ca:Cu = 1:1 is not realized in a single phase and the situation is further complicated by the fact that even for the identical stoichiometry of the CaO-CuO systems, various Ca ordering sequences are known and they crystallize in diversely modulated superstructures, and diffraction patterns of commensurate and incommensurate Ca/Cu orders. For example, for stoichiometries between x =0.143 (i.e., Ca:Cu ≈ 6:7) [35] and x =0.2 (i.e., Ca:Cu = 4:5) [34], two stacking variants of the Ca substructure have been identified [37,38]. For a Ca:Cu = 1:1 stoichiometry and only for high oxygen pressures (>1 GPa), the infinite-layer phase has been observed [7,28].
While it is important to establish thermodynamic boundary conditions to distinguish each constituent phase at three- or four phase equilibria, under actual experimental growth conditions, the phase boundaries are sensitive to subtle variations of the synthesis environment, and products of such a synthesis may contain admixtures of neighboring phases. Particularly, for the synthesis of thin films, where reactions take place under ultra-high vacuum conditions and the synthesis process itself may not be considered to be truly under thermal equilibrium, it is prudent to know the electronic properties regarding all thermodynamically stable phases involved. In the CaO-CuO system, the stable and simple oxides, e.g., CuO, CaO, and Cu_{2}O, are insulators. This is also true for the complex oxide phases of the CaO-CuO system, e.g., Ca_{2}CuO_{3} [39,40], CaCu_{2}O_{3} [41,42], and Ca_{1–}_{x}CuO_{2} [43,44], and the puzzling magnetic correlations observed in those phases are still a matter of intense debate [45]. For pure and single phase infinite-layer-CaCuO_{2}, thermodynamic, electronic, and theoretical considerations are far from clear and highly diffuse. From an experimental point of view, the infinite-layer phase of CaCuO_{2} is not a thermodynamically stable phase [46–48] and reports in the literature are typically for infinite-layer CaCuO_{2} thin films grown by pulsed laser deposition [16,49–57]. From a theoretical point of view [25,58–64], mounting evidence suggests that the electronic structure of infinite-layer CaCuO_{2} is sensitive on an extraordinary level with respect to crystallographic defects [65,66]. These defects may not be homogeneously distributed over the sample volume but form local incongruent clusters. Electrical conductivity measurements, which have been performed on infinite-layer CaCuO_{2} thin films grown by pulsed laser deposition [67] or reactive molecular beam epitaxy [68], show that the only determining criterion is to minimize those defects. From a thermodynamic point of view, this appears to be a tedious task (see Fig. 2) although it seems to be possible under appropriate thermodynamic constraints. The synthesis conditions necessary for the growth of infinite-layer CaCuO_{2} thin films by MBE (green area in Fig. 2) are at substantially lower synthesis temperatures, and it is unambiguously clear that an oxidizing agent different from molecular oxygen is needed. This is also true for the synthesis of infinite-layer SrCuO_{2} and infinite-layer Sr_{1–}_{x}Ca_{x}CuO_{2}, and the atomic oxygen pressures necessary to provide an oxidizing power equivalent to several GPa of molecular oxygen are 5 × 10^{−6} to 2 × 10^{−5 }Torr.
Sr-Cu-O phases
Thermodynamically stable phases of the SrO-CuO phase diagram have been reported as early as 1969, and Sr_{2}CuO_{3} was one of the first single crystals [69]. For a Sr:Cu = 1:1 stoichiometry, the synthesis of single crystals of SrCuO_{2} [70,71] was known. Quite similar to the situation of CaCuO_{2}, described above, the CuO_{2} plaquettes in SrCuO_{2} are not connected in an infinite network (see Fig. 1) but isolated. For the SrO-CuO thermodynamic system, large scale investigations started with the commencement of high-temperature superconductors [72]. As the thermodynamic phase diagram has more stable phases than we have seen in the CaO-CuO case (see Fig. 2), the chances of stabilizing a designated phase became even more slim. Moreover, the infinite-layer phase of the SrO-CuO system is a thermodynamically unstable phase and the oxygen pressure range necessary to stabilize infinite-layer SrCuO_{2} reaches several GPa. The SrO-CuO phase diagram (Fig. 3) shows stability regions for four ternary oxides at 1 atm, i.e., Sr_{2}CuO_{3}, SrCuO_{2} [3,76], SrCu_{2}O_{3} [74,77], and Sr_{14}Cu_{24}O_{41} [78–83]. The phase relations have been investigated as a function of the oxygen partial pressure in isothermal sections at 1173 K by Jacob and Mathews [84] and Suzuki et_al [85] The richness of spin and charge degrees of freedom observed particularly in the 2-leg ladder compound Sr_{14}Cu_{24}O_{41} [86,87] and the sensitivity of the dispersion between the Zhang-Rice singlet and the upper Hubbard band to the periodicity of the 2-leg ladder compound resulted in enhanced efforts to synthesize phase pure single crystals in the SrO-CuO phase diagram [88]. While high oxygen pressures of several GPa are necessary for the synthesis of the homologous series Sr_{n}_{+1}Cu_{n}O_{2}_{n}_{+1+}_{δ}, these phases are throughout stable at ambient conditions [89], and such wide-range thermodynamic stability is an enabler to pursue experiments at low temperatures. In Fig. 3, we have reproduced and augmented the thermodynamic phase diagram of the SrO-CuO system using data from Suzuki et_al [85], Moiseev et_al [74], and Smith et_al [75] Similar to the CaO-CuO phase diagram (Fig. 2), the infinite-layer phase is only stable at high oxygen pressures (≈10^{7} Torr), and it is worth mentioning that it is not the bare pressure that renders copper into square-planar coordinated plaquettes. Instead, the oxidizing potential of oxygen at high pressures is responsible for the stabilisation of the infinite layer structure [90]. Comparing Figs. 2 and 3, one may notice a shift of the stability region of the infinite-layer structure towards lower temperatures. Such a shift is a consequence of the enhanced chemical reaction kinetics in the presence of Sr. Converting the molecular oxygen pressure used in such studies (several GPa) into an equivalent atomic oxygen pressure (while neglecting finite life-time effects) allows us to determine the possible phase space for the synthesis of thin films at atomic oxygen pressures of 5 × 10^{−6} to 2 × 10^{−5 }Torr (green area in Fig. 3). While there have been a few reports on single phase bulk infinite-layer SrCuO_{2} materials [91–93], by far, the majority of the research results were reported from thin film samples synthesized either by pulsed laser deposition [94–100] or by molecular beam epitaxy [101–106]. Particularly, the phase transition between the orthorhombic and tetragonal structures of SrCuO_{2} [102,103] and the resultant modifications with respect to their electronic and magnetic phases have been discussed intensively [97,107–111]. Above all, the fact that the apparently simple crystal structure of infinite-layer SrCuO_{2} is anything but easy to synthesize led to enhanced efforts in investigating the quaternary system of CaO-SrO-CuO. Certainly, combining the SrO-CuO system (Fig. 3) with the CaO-CuO system (Fig. 2) will result in an ever more complex thermodynamic phase diagram with even more thermodynamically stable quaternary phases, e.g., the title compound Ca_{1–}_{x}Sr_{x}CuO_{2} or (Sr, Ca)_{14}Cu_{24}O_{41}. Clearly, the motivation to explore such complex thermodynamical phase relations for one is driven by the discovery of superconductivity in these systems [13,112] and by the expectation that is nourished by the high superconducting transition temperatures found in cuprates that are made of SrO-CaO-CuO phases [113–115]. As we will explore phases related to the SrO-CaO-CuO equilibrium below, we will see that a selective phase synthesis is not trivial as subtle nuances in thermodynamic conditions may tip the equilibrium towards another phase and the situation is not different for the synthesis of thin films using atomic oxygen as an oxidizing agent. Clearly, the synthesis conditions of infinite-layer SrCuO_{2} films by MBE (green area in Fig. 3) are distinct from bulk synthesis conditions, and most notably, they are at lower temperatures. Lower growth temperatures are beneficial for the synthesis of thermodynamically unstable phases.
Sr-Ca-Cu-O phases
Research efforts into the SrO-CaO-CuO system are primarily driven by reports on superconductivity [116,117] in the infinite-layer system and to some extent by the intricate magnetic ordering phenomena found in 2-leg ladder compounds [118–121]. While infinite-layer phases of CaCuO_{2} and SrCuO_{2} cannot be synthesized under ambient conditions, it was welcomed that the solid solution of CaCuO_{2} and SrCuO_{2}, with approx. 6:1 ratio, is exceptional, i.e., only this stoichiometry can be regarded as a thermodynamically stable phase. The synthesis of the infinite layer compound Ca_{1–}_{x}Sr_{x}CuO_{2} with x ≈0.15 was first reported by Roth et_al [32,122] at a synthesis temperature of 1223 K and in air and by Yamane et_al [123] at 1273 K at 1.01 atm O_{2}. With progressing efforts, several inconsistent results regarding the thermodynamic phase relations to stabilize the infinite layer phase of cuprates and its stability as functions of temperature and oxygen partial pressure have been reported [124,125]. These differences are summarized below. If synthesized in air, the infinite-layer phase of cuprates has been successfully grown when the synthesis temperature was between 1223 and 1233 K [32,126–130]. At these thermodynamic conditions, the infinite-layer phase of cuprates is in equilibrium with the 1:1 phase at the Sr-rich side and with the 2:1 phase and CuO at the Ca-rich side. Regarding the decomposition of infinite-layer compounds, it was observed for temperatures 1253, [129] 1258, [131] and between 1247 and 1266 K. [128] In contrast, Suzuki et_al [131] reported that infinite-layer cuprates decompose into CuO + 2:1 + 1:1. However, decomposition towards an equilibrium with the liquid phase appears more reasonable and, though under limited thermodynamic conditions, single crystals have been grown from slow cooling of the melt [122,132]. The data on the solubility limits are essential for the synthesis of thin films of infinite-layer-Ca_{1–}_{x}Sr_{x}CuO_{2} and will be summarized together with our experimental results on the variation of lattice parameters as these studies are often closely related (see the Results and Discussion section, Fig. 13). In an early review by Reardon and Hubbard, [127] X-ray diffraction data on the Ca-Sr-Cu-O solid solutions were summarized and their results unambiguously show that the (Sr, Ca)_{2}CuO_{3} and infinite-layer phases are subject to complete miscibility. With regard to the stability criteria of the infinite-layer phase, we note that this is one of the most important conclusions of the thermodynamic phase diagram as it highlights the direction of the relative instability of the infinite-layer phase towards the 2:1 structure, and this is important for the growth of the infinite-layer phase under ultra-high vacuum conditions. While the variation of the crystallographic lattice constants tracing along the solid solution have been determined, the results well coincide with Vegard's law. [134] In contrast, other compounds of the Sr-Ca-Cu-O system, e.g., (Sr, Ca)CuO_{2} and (Sr, Ca)_{14}Cu_{24}O_{41}, are known to only show partial solubilities towards Ca. None of these phases are, however, stable in the Ca-Cu-O system. Investigations based on bulk samples on the (Sr, Ca)-solubility range of the infinite-layer compound are summarized in Fig. 4. These data suggest that under ambient conditions, only a very limited solubility range of about 5% is accessible and that there is a small shift towards higher Ca-concentrations under enhanced oxygen partial pressure. However, attempts to determine any variation in the oxygen content of infinite-layer compounds via thermo-gravimetric methods in either air or pure oxygen were unsuccessful [126,135]. A complete comparison of all reported values would demand too many figures and tables and we provide here an overview of the SrO-CaO-CuO system while focusing on the infinite-layer phase. Amongst the different thermodynamic stability areas (shown in Fig. 4), a few 4-phase reactions cease at thermodynamic conditions which conform to the 4-phase invariant steady states of the ternary systems. [136] Regrettably, the thermodynamic phase relationships in the vicinity of the infinite-layer cuprate have been reported contradictory. [137] One might speculate that this problem originates from the fact that the 5-phase equilibrium between 2:1. 1:1, 14:24, CuO, and the infinite-layer compound is not far off to the thermodynamic conditions used among many experimental studies. If the oxygen partial pressures are below that of the 5-phase equilibrium 2:1–1:1–14:24-CuO-infinite-layer, the infinite-layer cuprate should crystallize out of the 2:1, 1:1, and CuO phases. This is the most remarkable distinction compared to the thermodynamic phase diagram of the CaO-CuO and the SrO-CuO system. Apparently, the reaction temperature of the infinite-layer phase formation is nearly independent of p_{O2} and, more importantly, is weakly influenced by the Ca/Sr stoichiometry of the infinite-layer phase. [138] Nonetheless, increasing p_{O2} enhances the formation of the infinite-layer phase from 2:1, 14:24, and CuO. Using the stoichiometric approximation method [138,139], it is worth mentioning that the dependency of the formation temperature on the oxygen partial pressure might be higher than what has been reported under real experimental conditions, though its deviation may not be excessive and high oxygen partial pressures are known to stabilize the infinite-layer cuprate phase preferably. As the range of the Gibbs energy values of the infinite-layer cuprate phase is broad, a shift of the lower stability limit towards lower temperatures can be easily explained and two scenarios can be derived from the available data. First, thermodynamic kinetics forming the infinite-layer cuprate phase would be slow and the thermodynamic stability limits are between 1173 K in air and 1223 K in 1 atm O_{2}. It is somehow peculiar that the studies that contradict this stability phase space would therefore be unable to stabilize the infinite-layer cuprate phase [131,140–143]. In a second scenario, a fast reaction kinetics of the infinite-layer phase is assumed and the infinite-layer cuprate would continue to be metastable, as shown in several studies [129,144,145]. Apparently, the second possibility is more likely in the present assessment. Vallino et_al [144] found CuO + 1:1 to be more stable than 14:24 + 2:1 at 1173 K which is in contradiction to other reports [140,141,146,147]. Majewski et_al [148] observed at compositions near Sr_{0.14}Ca_{0.86}CuO_{2} that the kinetics of formation of 1:1 is faster than that of 2:1. This would explain that the infinite-layer phase can form and persist being metastable at 1173 K even in air. [112] The optimized thermodynamic boundary conditions of the infinite-layer cuprate phase are in continuance to the above discussions of the data in air. Under 1 atm O_{2}, the synthesis temperature is higher than expected from the data reported by George et_al [145] Those results are well along the line of what has been reported by Vallino et_al [144] and Kikkawa et_al, [129] and this is an indication that the thermodynamic stability boundary of the infinite-layer cuprate phase may be even lower than 1 atm O_{2} pressure. The phase relationships reported [145] include, however, some inconsistencies on the equilibria between 2:1, 1:1, and 14:24, which may indicate that an equilibrium condition was absent in their investigations. Generally, two types of phase relations are expected around the infinite-layer compound. At 1223 K and under 1 atm oxygen, the infinite-layer compound is found in equilibrium with 2:1, 14:24, and CuO. The equilibrium infinite-layer-2:1–14:24 is consistent with data of Yamane et_al [123] At the Ca-rich side, the equilibria with CaCu_{2}O_{3} are found to be less stable than the equilibria infinite-layer-2:1-CuO. The phase relations at 1123 K, i.e., below the formation of the infinite-layer compound, show the same phase relations as in air or 1 atm O_{2} at higher temperatures. With the increasing partial oxygen pressure, [113] the maximum Ca solubility decreases in 1:1 and increases in 14:24. [149] The compound Ca_{0.83}CuO_{1.93} appears at 1.5 bar O_{2}. Note that the equilibria between Ca_{0.83}CuO_{1.93} and the infinite-layer phase reported by Kikkawa et_al [129,150] are most probably somewhat above the decomposition temperature of Ca_{0.83}CuO_{1.93} and thus metastable. With decreasing oxygen partial pressure, the reaction 2:1 + 14:24 = 1:1+ CuO occurs and then 14:24 disappears. Two additional reactions, 1:1 + CuO = 1:2 + 2:1 and 2:1 + Cu_{2}O = 1:2+ 1:0, lead to the phase relations found in Ar atmospheres with p_{O2}<1Pa. For the synthesis of infinite-layer cuprates Ca_{1–}_{x}Sr_{x}CuO_{2}, the phase formation around x ≈0.15 is subject to the less stringent growth criteria where it is sufficient to readily oxidize copper towards CuO. [151] We will see later on that the substitution of Ca by Sr is indeed a benefactor for the synthesis of the infinite-layer phase.
Until now, we have discussed the thermodynamic constraints for the synthesis of infinite-layer-CaCuO_{2}, infinite-layer-SrCuO_{2}, and infinite-layer-Ca_{1–}_{x}Sr_{x}CuO_{2}. For the BaO-CuO system, however, the synthesis of the infinite-layer phase requires one more boundary condition, i.e., epitaxial strain, as we will discuss below.
Ba-Cu-O phases
Investigations into the BaO-CuO ternary system are motivated by the discovery of the high-temperature superconductor YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}, and it became clear that the relation towards the infinite-layer phase in SrO-CuO or CaO-CuO might be of importance. [152] In contrast to infinite-layer phases of CaCuO_{2}, SrCuO_{2}, and their solid solutions Ca_{1–}_{x}Sr_{x}CuO_{2}, infinite-layer BaCuO_{2} has not been reported. However, under certain circumstances, mono-layers of the infinite-layer phase of BaCuO_{2} may be stabilized. [153] The thermodynamic phase relations of the BaO-CuO system were investigated by Jondo et_al, [155] Abbattista et_al, [156] Voronin and Degterov, [157] Lindemer and Specht, [154] Zhang et_al, [158] and Zimmermann et_al [159] While those investigations clarified the relationship between the various BaO-CuO compositions, [160] the infinite-layer phase, where copper exclusively forms infinitely connected CuO_{2} layers, has not been observed. This is also true for high pressure experiments performed by Laffez et_al [161] For thin film studies, however, quasi-infinite-layer BaCuO_{2} phases have been reported where BaCuO_{2} is sandwiched between CaCuO_{2} and SrCuO_{2} layers. Superconductivity in the infinite-layer-BaCuO_{2} system appears only if it is sandwiched between infinite-layer materials with smaller alkaline earth elements, e.g., SrCuO_{2}, [162] and this fact is closely related to the defective CuO_{2} planes sandwiched between BaO layers. [163] Such highly strained infinite-layer BaCuO_{2} films allow for physical characterizations, and one should caution that the dominating factor supporting the phase formation is strain brought about the bottom and top layers. In the thermodynamic phase diagram of the BaO-CuO system [Fig. 5 (Refs [157],  [164], and  [165])], the phase space of the infinite-layer phase remains vacant [166–168] and only limited data are available on bulk materials [169–171]. In some rare cases, single crystalline materials of the BaO-CuO system were reported. [172] Our attempts made here to synthesize infinite-layer BaCuO_{2} thin films by molecular beam epitaxy with the thickness larger than 3 unit cells did not result in any conclusive outcome using various substrate materials, e.g., (001) SrTiO_{3} (STO), (001) (LaAlO_{3})_{0.3}(SrTa_{0.5}Al_{0.5}O_{3})_{0.7} (LSAT), (110) DyScO_{3} (DSO), and (110) NdGaO_{3} (NGO). The reason for this behavior may be partly due to the large ionic size of Ba^{2+} ions, thus putting the stability criteria of the infinite-layer phase in a thermodynamically unfavorable position. Theoretical considerations on the existence of an infinite-layer-BaCuO_{2} crystal without the support of epitaxial strain are still ongoing. [173]
The fact that the infinite-layer phase exists only over a small portion of the thermodynamic phase diagrams needs to be accounted for when synthesizing them. The infinite-layer phase is a thermodynamically stable phase only within constricted Ca:Sr stoichiometries. Moreover, the synthesis of thin films takes place always on substrates and the selection of the substrate material should be considered always with respect to a reduced lattice mismatch at the substrate/film interface. Before discussing our results on the synthesis of infinite-layer thin films, it is prudent to detail on the processes involved and more importantly to consider these processes under the extreme conditions prevalent to MBE, e.g., ultra-high vacuum and atomic oxygen.
EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS
Molecular beam epitaxy takes place under ultra-high vacuum, and for such conditions, the chemical kinetics of phase stabilization is significantly altered when compared to ambient conditions. While Sr or Ca vapors may readily oxidize, the situation for Cu is entirely different. Therefore, we discuss the chemical kinetics of Cu, particularly under low partial oxygen pressures, in detail.
Evaporation by electron guns
In molecular beam epitaxy, one of the vital components is the evaporation sources. In our MBE setup (see Fig. 6), we employed electron guns for the evaporation of Ca, Sr, Ba, and Cu. Magnetic deflection is used to direct an intense beam of electrons into a water cooled hearth. For non-melting sources, e.g., Ca, Sr, or Ba, scanning is used to traverse over the source surface in order to ensure a high evaporation rate stability. E-beam systems operated under ultra-high vacuum have demonstrated ample aptitude to vaporize and deposit not only easy to operate pure elements like aluminium, zinc, gold, and silver [174,175] but also more demanding low vapor pressure elements like ruthenium and palladium [176,177], and highly reactive elements such as Ca, Sr, and Ba. Moreover, the high thermal conductivity and the high affinity of Cu towards other metals appear to be a true challenge for its evaporation though with the appropriate crucible material combination, this task can be satisfactory fulfilled.
Flux rate control
Flux control is achieved by electron impact emission spectroscopy (EIES). The evaporation rate is proportional to the vapor pressure. [178] For electron beam evaporation systems, it is difficult to measure the exact temperature distribution function of the melt [179] or the source material and the flux of each element needs to be determined by other methods, i.e., EIES. EIES is a measurement technique which is derived from atomic emission spectroscopy, and it was developed for the quantitative determination of elemental compositions in plasmas [180,181]. In short, emission of photons occurs upon the relaxation of excited states of an element into its ground states and this process is unique for each element in the periodic table simply due to their unambiguously defined energy levels. The intensity profile detected in such a spectrum scales linearly with the number of atoms involved in the excited states, and this is a very important distinction of the emission spectroscopy technique when compared to absorption techniques [182–186]. Excitation sources used in atomic emission spectroscopy are typically plasmas or electric arcs [187–189]. This technique was refined for application under ultra-high vacuum by Lu et_al, [190] where electrons can be used as a stimulant for the excitation of an atomic flux. A continuous excitation of the atomic flux allows for an uninterrupted monitoring of the flux. Also, EIES is a measurement technique that is applicable to a wide range of vacuum thin film processes, particularly to MBE applications. The material being deposited is excited by a thermionic electron emitter, which results in the creation of photons. The light from these photons is directed through an optical filter to a photomultiplier (PMT) detector. The detector measures an optical emission spectrum unique to the material of interest. The intensity of the emission is a measure of the deposition rate. Additional detectors, with appropriate optical band pass filters, can be used to measure and control multiple elements simultaneously [18,20,190–200]. In Fig. 7, we plot the rate profiles j of Sr, Ca, and Cu recorded during the growth of CaCuO_{2} [Fig. 7(a)], Ca_{0.80}Sr_{0.20}CuO_{2} [Fig. 7(b)], Ca_{0.20}Sr_{0.80}CuO_{2} [Fig. 7(c)], SrCuO_{2} [Fig. 7(d)], and infinite layer thin films. The absolute rate deviation has been highlighted in the inset in Fig. 7(c) to be ±0.0025 Å/s for Cu. It is worth mentioning that the rate stability achieved by an EIES controlled e-gun is comparable or even better when compared to conventional effusion cell sources. [201] Even more so, for aggressive elements, i.e., Sr, the flux stability in an oxygen environment is apparently problematic when using effusion cells [202] and the associated difficulties stem from the extreme high stability of the formed oxides [203–205]. Certainly, EIES is a powerful tool in ensuring extraordinary flux rate stabilities during e-beam evaporation though there are other factors contributing to the stability of the fluxes, e.g., the stability of the high-voltage power supply unit, which should be taken into account. [206] Constant and monotonic fluxes of each constituent element are unbudgeable prerequisites for the synthesis of infinite-layer cuprates. The infinite-layer cuprates are ternary (infinite-layer-CaCuO_{2} and infinite-layer-SrCuO_{2}) or quaternary (infinite-layer-Ca_{1–}_{x}Sr_{x}CuO_{2}) phases, and the fact that subtle stoichiometry fluctuations of the supplied fluxes may tip the balance towards thermodynamically competing phases (see Figs. 2–4) may accentuate the outstanding rate stabilities achievable by e-guns when controlled via a EIES feedback loop.
Oxidation—Thermodynamics and kinetics
Synthesising the infinite-layer cuprates requires more than a stable supply of metal fluxes and that is an appropriate oxidizing environment. To satisfy this requirement, atomic oxygen is in favor of other oxidizing agents. We should keep in mind that there are two distinct reasons that place a powerful oxidizing agent in an exigent position. For one, owing to the vacuum environment, the oxidizing agent needs to be able to readily oxidize copper. Second, and this point appears to be more pertinent for the synthesis of infinite-layer cuprates, the oxidizing agent should be of sufficient power to mimic the oxidizing potentials that appear under high molecular oxygen pressure (bulk synthesis of infinite-layer cuprates). Explicitly, for the synthesis of YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7}, it is sufficient to provide an oxidizing agent under vacuum that can oxidize copper. For infinite-layer cuprates, however, this criterion is necessary but not sufficient. For infinite-layer cuprates, the oxidizing agent must be of comparable oxidizing power as several GPa of molecular oxygen.
For bulk copper, the oxidizing process has been thoroughly investigated [207–209] at temperatures below 200 °C and it was found that the oxidizing process follows a parabolic rate law. It was shown by Mott that the parabolic rate law arises when a diffusive process through an oxide barrier is the rate limiting process. [210] Consequently, prior to the formation of the diffusion barrier, the rate of oxidation is higher. [211] At higher temperatures above 200 °C, the oxidation proceeds with rate laws deviating from parabolic response [212–221]. Qualitatively, the time-dependent oxidizing rate might be explained by assuming that copper oxide forms islands and upon coalesce of those islands, the oxidation rate notably decreases. [222] While the temperature dependency of the rate of CuO formation provides a clear-cut result, the oxygen pressure dependency lacks precision [217,223]. This is an important observation particularly for high-vacuum conditions [224] where a linear oxidizing rate has been reported. Therefore, the net temperature and oxygen pressure dependence of the oxidation rate is similar to the oxidation process of Si into SiO_{2} [225] or the thermal oxidation of Ga into Ga_{2}O_{3} by Vogt and Bierwagen. [226] As far as the linear oxidation rate constants are concerned, a linear dependency on the oxygen partial pressure is to be expected if the rate determining step of the reaction is determined by the dissociation of molecular oxygen on the surface. The activation energy of this dissociation process is 27 kJ/mol = 0.28 eV/atom, and this is within the same order of magnitude when compared to the surface self-diffusion barrier of oxygen. [227]
For ultra-high vacuum applications, molecular oxygen can be simply ruled out as a sufficient oxidizing agent and we will discuss these issues further. For the thin film synthesis of infinite-layer superconducting cuprates, it is of utmost importance to simultaneously ensure an appropriate oxidizing environment while maintaining long mean free path lengths of the evaporants. Hence, the thermodynamic synthesis conditions are not confined to an inimitable combination of partial oxygen pressure and growth temperature but rather spread over a range of conditions. For the synthesis of cuprates in bulk form, there are several reports discussing their appropriate oxidizing conditions [208,228–244] though it is not a surprise that the oxygen pressure values were significantly above what is considered to be tolerable for MBE. Thermodynamic stability lines define the minimal partial oxygen pressure for a given temperature below which the phase decomposes. For two high-T_{c} superconductors, we plot their thermodynamic stability lines in Fig. 8 extrapolated into oxygen partial pressures that are compatible with MBE. The positions of these thermodynamic stability lines suggest that partial oxygen pressures well beyond MBE compatible tolerances would be necessary at appropriate synthesis temperatures.
An unbudgeable condition for MBE is to perpetuate mean free path lengths for every constituent element that exceeds the source-to-substrate clearance, which is 19 in (48 cm) for our MBE setup (see Fig. 6). It is throughout cogitable to synthesize cuprates, under oxygen partial pressures higher than the limits set by the mean-free paths [229,245–255]; however, such elevated oxygen partial pressure values drive the stoichiometry control [229,254,256–258] as well as in situ analysis by reflection high-energy electron reflection (RHEED) ineluctably impossible. At high oxygen pressure values, the collision events with the evaporated species as they travel between the electron gun and the substrate are heightened, and this results in deviations of the constituent elements that arrive at the substrate. Nonetheless, this intricate control issue may be readily solved when the synthesis is carried out at oxygen pressures that are compatible with the objective of MBE. For the synthesis of infinite-layer cuprates, the mean-free path lengths of Cu, Ca, and Sr are of interest and we used the molecular oxygen corrected mean-free path lengths. [259] We listed the element related parameters and the resulting mean-free path lengths in Table III. Certainly, it is expedient to realize that the disparity of mean-free path lengths between the constituent elements is not more than a factor of three under conditions where molecular oxygen is the scattering-rate determining factor. Lowering the oxygen partial pressure reduces the scattering rates and the mean-free path lengths (L) increase like L^{−1}∝p_{O2}. At pressures lower than 10^{−8 }Torr, the scattering rates between the evaporated elements and molecular oxygen become negligible while the inter-element scattering rates start to dominate [228,238,239].
Pertinent to overcome this issue is the introduction of more potent oxidizing agents as well as an enhanced pumping speed: the pressure in the MBE chamber can be lower than the threshold where the stoichiometry of the synthesized oxide is affected [260–262]. In the absence of rare-earth or alkaline-earth metals, the synthesis of CuO requires high oxygen partial pressures [263,264]. On the other hand, in the presence of alkaline-earth and/or rare-earth constituent elements, cuprates can be synthesized at significantly lower partial oxygen pressures that may even fit to the demands of MBE [265–271]. Nonetheless, for the synthesis of the infinite-layer phase of cuprates under MBE conditions, molecular oxygen is simply an impossible oxidizing agent and one has to look for better options.
Conditioning of oxygen species
This task can be fulfilled by comparing the effectiveness of atomic oxygen, ozone, and molecular oxygen to oxidize Cu into CuO [233,238–240,266,272,273]. Several studies have been performed using oxidizing agents [274–278], e.g., atomic oxygen (O), oxygen ions (O^{+}), ozone (O_{3}), and NO_{2}, and the creation of cupric oxides has been observed by in situ [260,274,275,278,279] and ex situ [274,275,277,280,281] measurement techniques. Common to these results is that the usage of atomic oxygen appears to be the most effective oxidizing agent and this statement is supported by the fact that the atomic oxygen does not impose a significant barrier to the reaction [228,229,260,274,275,282–287] and such reaction kinetics is in contrast to the behavior observed for molecular oxygen. Moreover, atomic oxygen sources are easy to be operated under ultra-high vacuum conditions. A common drawback is, however, that the cracking efficiency of atomic oxygen sources operated at radio-frequencies does not exceed the 15% threshold [229,288–292], which, in turn, inundates the MBE system by unwanted gas.
Let us recall the topic of this manuscript to describe ways that allow for the stabilization of meta-stable cuprates, i.e., the infinite-layer structured cuprates. The cooperation of low surface diffusion of Cu and alkaline-earth metals in combination with epitaxial stabilization under strong oxidizing conditions is pertinent to the synthesis of single-crystalline, infinite-layer cuprates. We employed an RF oxygen source, and its details will be discussed in the following.
It is this oxidizing power criterion that determines the resultant phase formation. Unlike orthorhombic SrCuO_{2}, the synthesis of the infinite-layer phase SrCuO_{2} is more difficult as one has to maximize the oxidizing power during the growth.
A series of spectra were taken for the RF oxygen plasma source under conditions that cover the range of synthesis conditions of infinite layer cuprates for the purpose of identifying O, O_{2}, O^{+}, and O2+ emission lines [295,296] (see Fig. 9). If a plasma is in a thermodynamic equilibrium state, then electron temperature is equal to the gas or plasma temperature. On the other hand, for a non-equilibrium state, these temperatures are unequal and one should therefore consider that the ion temperature of the system corresponds to the gas temperature. Under such assumptions, the partial densities of all the charges of each sign are approximately equal, i.e., a condition of electrical quasi-neutrality does exist [297,298]. Nearly all regions of the ionized gas can be considered to be electrically neutral; hence, n^{+} = Zn_{e}, where n^{+} and n_{e} are the densities of positive ions and electrons, respectively, and the correlation between electrons and positively charged ions is determined by the Debye length [299,300]. In high frequency electric fields, the acceleration of electrons is much larger than that of ions and the amount of kinetic energy transferred to the electrons is therefore significantly larger than that to the ions. Moreover, the alternating field directions result in electron oscillations within the volume of the gas if the distance of the walls in the discharge bulb is larger than the electron mean free path. At high frequencies, e.g., RF, electrons collide with oxygen molecules, thereby generating more electrons. Subsequent to such collisions, they are accelerated by the field regardless of the net effect of each collision. Such energy gains are compensated by collisions with oxygen atoms which may result in excitations or ionizations under the premises that the electric field is large enough. When the excited electrons in the atoms relax to their ground states, the energy is balanced by photon emission (see Table IV). Numerical simulations of this complex equilibrium have shown that the production rate of atomic oxygen is maximal for certain pressure and RF power parameters. [301] In Fig. 9, we plot optical intensities of the RF oxygen plasma recorded with a Hamamatsu mini-spectrometer (TM series) as a function of the oxygen flow rate at 436.8 and 777.2 nm. These two transitions are representatives for the generation of atomic oxygen and therefore of importance for the synthesis of infinite-layer cuprates. The intensity behavior at 436.8 nm indicates that there is an optimal flow rate at ∼1.5 sccm though this behavior is not seen for the transition at 777.2 nm. This discrepancy is a result of the limited resolution of the spectrometer (±10 nm), and it is likely that the contributions from the nearby transition originating from O^{+} ions (see Table IV) are the source of this apparent maximum. For the transition representing the 777.2 nm line, the intensity monotonically increases for flow rates up to 5 sccm. However, the gain in atomic oxygen generation is the highest at low flow rates. Such plasma dynamics can be explained when considering the following scenario. When a fraction of electrons has enough energy gained to exceed the ionization energy, additional electrons are released, thus representing a source for free electrons generated at such high frequencies. Simultaneously, electrons are absorbed by diffusion to the walls and by processes such as recombination with positively charged ions. It is the net value of these production and loss rates that determine the level of the electron concentration. Several reports that investigated the kinetics for over 20 different oxygen species, including neutral oxygen atoms, molecules, and ozone, have shown that the limiting factors to the production rate of atomic oxygen are wall as well as two-body collisions [303–310]. Excited states are always subject to their lifetime and O(^{1}D) and O(^{1}S) are the only states of significance while all other states rapidly decay [301,311–326]. It was shown by Ingle et_al [327] that a nearly 100% cracking efficiency of oxygen can be reached while the flux of atomic oxygen is 3.5 × 10^{15} atoms/cm^{2 }s. By increasing the pressure in the RF discharge cavity, O2⋆ becomes the main species with a density significantly higher than that of atomic oxygen at 100 Pa. Apparently, a variation in the type of reactive oxygen species will have influences on the reaction kinetics that promotes a certain phase formation and this may further alter their electronic properties via stoichiometric variations. Numerical studies using either molecular dynamics or kinetic Monte Carlo simulations by Blackwell et_al were able to reproduce such influences. [328] Specifically, as the O/O_{2} ratio varied, so did the stoichiometry, crystal structure, and electronic behavior of their synthesized ZnO films. [329] As a low oxygen background pressure in the MBE system is vital to effectively suppress recombination processes, [330] we equipped our MBE chamber (see Fig. 6) with a turbo-molecular pump with an effective pumping speed of 3500 l/s.
Synthesis temperature
It is due to purely thermodynamic reasons that the oxidation of a metal is not only subject to the oxidizing agent but also temperature. The synthesis temperature is the temperature that is measured at the surface of the substrate and subsequently at the surfaces of each consecutive thin film layer. It is this temperature that needs to be considered when determining the thermodynamic boundaries and stability limits (see Figs. 2–5). Yet, the determination of this temperature is far from being straightforward as it depends on a plethora of boundary conditions, e.g., substrate material, emissivity tensor of the substrate material, thermal conductivity of the substrate material, and thermal conductivity of the substrate holder. For the synthesis of thin films by molecular beam epitaxy, methods such as Raman spectroscopy [331] and band edge thermometry [332] have been developed with the sole purpose to aptly determine the synthesis temperature under ultra-high vacuum conditions. Common ground to those investigations is the fact that the emissivity tensors of substrate materials as well as the synthesized materials govern the temperature deviations determined by pyrometry. Substrate materials used for the synthesis of high-T_{c} superconductors are insulating oxides, e.g., SrTiO_{3}, DyScO_{3}, or NdGaO_{3}. Even for such a widely used and long time investigated material like SrTiO_{3}, emissivity values between 0.8 [333] and 0.35 [334] have been reported, thus leaving a high degree of uncertainty on the absolute substrate temperature. Using a transparent and insulating material such as SrTiO_{3} as a substrate material and growing a black and metallic high-T_{c} superconductor on top results in an abrupt change in synthesis temperature, particularly at the interface. Hence, as the emissivity tensor of the cuprate grown onto the substrate is certainly different from that of the substrate, we may not be able, at least at this point, to precisely determine the absolute synthesis temperature. Quite generally, metallic surfaces have a very small emissivity value (<0.1) owing to their high reflectivity. As far as simple 3d transition metal oxides are concerned, e.g., TiO_{2} or CuO, they are all insulating and their emissivity coefficients are larger than 0.35. If, as it is the case for the synthesis of the infinite-layer cuprates, the oxide becomes a dark and black colored metal, emissivity values might be reduced. This leaves quite some room for measurement uncertainty. In our MBE setup, the substrate is mounted on a substrate holder that is significantly larger than the substrate itself. Assuming that the temperature of the substrate holder is uniform with a known temperature, the radiation situation surrounding the substrate can be considered as a nearly ideal black-body radiation system. We can therefore be certain that while the exact, absolute synthesis temperature is unknown, within an error of ±30 °C, a reasonable accurate substrate temperature value can be determined using a pyrometer. We employed a pyrometer (Japan Sensor, see Fig. 6) with a measurement range of 800–1600 nm, and we kept the emissivity value constant at 0.67 throughout the experiments discussed here.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
One of the most versatile feedback tools used during the synthesis of thin film materials is RHEED. It allows, in real-time, to visualize the growth in reciprocal space. One can readily realize if appropriate growth conditions are met. Here, electrons with high energies (∼30 keV) are used. The RHEED patterns of a flat surface show long streaks normal to the surface. [335] The streakiness of RHEED patterns is a firsthand indicator of a planar sample surface whereas the broadening of the streaks is caused by areas of reduced coherence on the surface. From the RHEED images shown in Fig. 10 taken from Ca_{1–}_{x}Sr_{x}CuO_{2} thin films, clear and distinct streaks are discernible irrespective of x.
Using thermodynamic phase diagrams allows us to investigate the proximity of the various thermodynamically stable phases that compete via temperature, partial oxygen pressure, and stoichiometry with the infinite-layer-phase of cuprates. Those phases have various crystallographic dimensions and space groups as shown in Table I. In Fig. 10, we show RHEED images for infinite-layer Ca_{1–}_{x}Sr_{x}CuO_{2} thin films grown on various substrate materials in the [100] direction. In all cases (various x), it was possible to establish thermodynamic boundaries that are in favor of the infinite-layer phase resulting in single-crystal thin films with flat surfaces. It is worth emphasizing that the RHEED images alone do not necessarily directly proof the existence of the infinite-layer phase as the streaky patterns seen in Fig. 10 may originate from combinations of competing phases. To rule out such scenarios, X-ray diffraction high-resolution reciprocal space mapping (HRRSM) provides information that allows clear distinctions of what phases have been grown. While the RHEED images shown in Fig. 10 originate from single-phase infinite-layer Ca_{1–}_{x}Sr_{x}CuO_{2}, there are significant differences among them. These differences stem from complex surface reconstructions that appear once the growth of the infinite-layer phase has been finalized. Such surface reconstruction effects in infinite-layer cuprates have been recently investigated in detail by Harter et_al, [104] and we therefore do not discuss them further. In Figs. 11 and 12, HRRSM images of infinite-layer CaCuO_{2}, Ca_{0.94}Sr_{0.06}CuO_{2}, and Ca_{0.20}Sr_{0.80}CuO_{2} thin films grown on (001)LSAT, (110)NdGaO_{3}, and (110)DyScO_{3} substrates are shown. We measured the (103) peak to investigate the in-plane lattice parameter as well as the out-of-plane lattice parameter. The (103) diffraction peak of the film is located near the dashed lines (Figs. 11 and 12), indicating that the films have been grown nearly coherently and, thus, the in-plane lattice parameter of the film is nearly identical to that of the substrate. However, the shape of the peaks is somewhat diffuse along the transverse scan direction as a result of a partial strain relaxation. From Figs. 11 and 12, one can recognize at a glance that the infinite-layer phase has been formed. While the absolute lattice mismatches between the infinite-layer films and the corresponding substrate materials are small (<1%), all films are grown coherently (see also Fig. 13). Moreover, this appears to be independent of the substitution level x as we continuously varied x between 0.00 and 1.00 as shown in Fig. 13. Using (001) LSAT substrates, Ca_{1–}_{x}Sr_{x}CuO_{2} films can be stabilized from x =0 (misfit –0.42%) up to x =0.80 (misfit + 1.12%). For x larger than 0.60, growth on either STO or DSO substrates allows for smaller misfits (< 1%).
In Fig. 14, we plot high-resolution X-ray diffraction patterns of the (001) reflections of Ca_{1–}_{x}Sr_{x}CuO_{2} films for x =0, 0.06, and 0.60. The observation of distinct Laue oscillations allows us to precisely determine the coherent volumes of the films. Thickness values determined by Laue oscillations well coincide with what has been determined complementary from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis shown in Fig. 15. V-shaped defects at the surface of the CaCuO_{2} thin films (see Fig. 15) are pertinent to Sr-free infinite-layer thin films, owing to the significantly reduced growth kinetics in the absence of Sr. For infinite-layer CaCuO_{2} films grown on (001)LSAT substrates, V-shaped defects are scattered all over the surface and this is independent of the substrate material used. Moreover, the appearance of those V-shaped defects results in a broadening of the RHEED streaks. By substituting a small amount of Ca by Sr (here, we used 6% Sr), these large surface defects can be effectively suppressed.
To confirm the local arrangements of cations of the grown infinite-layer cuprate thin films, we analyzed each film by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) while recording high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopic (EDS) images [340–351]. STEM measurements were performed at 200 keV using an aberration-corrected JEOL ARM-200CF microscope equipped with a JEOL Centurio silicon drift detector for energy dispersive scanning x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis. All images were acquired along the [110] zone-axis with an ∼1 Å probe size and an 18–22 mrad convergence semi-angle, yielding an approximate probe current of 20 pA. STEM-HAADF images and STEM-EDS maps were acquired at a 90 mrad collection inner semi-angle; the latter was conducted in multiple regions with an approximate instantaneous pixel dwell time of 200 μs px^{−1}, an effective total dwell time of 5 ms px^{−1}, and a total collection time of 52 min. Maps were processed for net counts, with a background removal and multiple linear least squares fit of reference spectra to deconvolute overlapping peaks. Multislice simulations were conducted using the quantum excitation of phonons (QEP) model, [352] which accounts for beam channeling effects and allows for separation of elastic and thermal electrons, in contrast to the frozen phonon model. A Gaussian finite source correction (FWHM = 0.1 nm) was applied to the resulting ionization maps. Figure 16 shows STEM and element specific STEM-EDS maps for Sr L_{α} (1.806 kV), La L_{α} (4.650 kV), Ti K_{α} (4.508 kV), Cu K_{α} (8.035 kV), Ta L_{α} (8.134 kV), Al K_{α} (1.493 kV), Ca K_{α} (3.693 kV), and O K_{α} (0.530 kV) taken from interface regions. Figures 17(d)–17(f) show line-scans of the electron densities along the dashed line [see Figs. 17(a)–17(c) boxed area].
Such microscopically resolved snapshots together with their associated intensity profiles are powerful tools in identifying local structural distortions or defects. They indicate that the films are free from any unidentified phases, orientations, or stacking sequences. On the other hand, x-ray diffraction is sensitive to the coherent volume of the crystal and it is therefore possible to ensure the crystalline quality on a macroscopic scale. The x-ray diffraction analysis (see Figs. 11, 12, and 14) allows us to conclude that single-domain thin films of Ca_{1–}_{x}Sr_{x}CuO_{2} with infinite slabs of CuO_{2} have been epitaxially grown. One can therefore be confident that crystallographic defects are below the detection limits of our analysis and that the measured electronic transport properties are not subject to scattering events at grain boundaries or other macroscopic defects. However, the problem that arises at this level is that defect distributions could be random and this is particularly true for point defects. Moreover, even if defects were to form coherently in one dimension, e.g., the formation of a quasi-infinite-layer cuprate where every third CuO_{2} plane is rotated along the [110] direction, [353] diffraction techniques would not be able to identify them as such. Nonetheless, the appearance of such defects has a strong influence on electronic transport properties, e.g., resistivity measurements. For metallic materials, two processes determine over the resistivity behavior, i.e., phonons and crystal defects [354,355]. Electron scattering events in a crystal lattice result in higher electrical resistivities and the resistivity may scale to the defect concentration up to a point where the material is not a metal anymore but becomes insulating. [356] Unfortunately, one might not be able to conclude on the types of defects but this approach provides some clue to the quality of the material, i.e., the lower the resistivity, the better the infinite-layer cuprate crystal quality. Therefore, we measured the temperature dependency of the resistivity using a four-probe measurement technique. It is well known for cuprate superconductors that the electronic response is inseparably tied to a vast amount of defects [357] and we expect that an annealing process applied after the MBE growth of the Ca_{1–}_{x}Sr_{x}CuO_{2} thin films may influence its electronic response. In Fig. 18(a), we plot the temperature dependence of resistivity of Ca_{0.40}Sr_{0.60}CuO_{2} thin films (∼100 nm thickness) after annealing them at 300 °C, 350 °C, 400 °C, 450 °C, and 500 °C under a partial ozone pressure of approximately 5 × 10^{−6 }Torr for 10 min. For comparison, we also plot the resistivity behavior of an as-grown thin film in Fig. 18.
After annealing in ozone, the total resistivity is significantly lower irrespective of the annealing temperature and annealing at 450 °C provides infinite layer thin films with the lowest overall resistivity. Nonetheless, even such samples remain insulating and needless to say is that such behavior is incompatible with a potential superconducting response. In Fig. 18(b), we performed a similar annealing procedure, though this time under ultra-high vacuum. In contrast to the relatively large variation in resistivity observed from the annealing under low ozone partial pressures [Fig. 18(a)], the overall variation is rather small and the total trend of insulating response barely changes. Ca_{0.85}Sr_{0.15}CuO_{2} thin films annealed under strong oxidizing conditions (see Fig. 19) exhibit metallic conduction (∂ρ/∂T >0). This metallic conduction is associated with superconductivity at 12 K. This shows that there exist regions in the infinite-layer cuprate thin film that are, at least, clean and undisturbed on a length scale comparable to the coherence length of the superconductor (∼3 nm). However, the resistivity value (see Fig. 18) does not change significantly from that in the as-grown thin films (at most by a factor of 2) and it remains close to 50 mΩ cm at 300 K (equal to e^{2}/ℏ) when the film thickness is ∼100 nm. Moreover, the superconducting transition temperature at which ρ = 0 does not correlate with the absolute resistivity value but appears to be rather random. From this experiment, we may conclude that the induction of superconductivity in infinite-layer-Ca_{1–}_{x}Sr_{x}CuO_{2} thin films is a consequence of an annealing procedure. Annealing procedures are diffusion procedures and the resultant sample will contain oxygen concentration gradients and it is therefore important to determine the volume fraction of the superconducting state as it is intriguing to recognize that the observed high resistivity values are incompatible with bulk superconductivity. It is noteworthy that Castro et_al [358] reported that the induction of superconductivity in CaCuO_{2} is directly linked to the appearance of pyramidal oxygen coordination of copper. It has been further pointed out that the electronic conduction depends on the oxidizing power used during the synthesis of CaCuO_{2} thin films grown by pulsed laser deposition [358] and we observe a similar trend for infinite-layer films grown by MBE (see Fig. 6).
In order to confirm this scenario, we synthesized Ca_{0.85}Sr_{0.15}CuO_{2} thin films by MBE with thicknesses of t =9.96, 49.8, and 99.6 nm and compared their corresponding resistivity values at 300 and 100 K (see Fig. 20). If the observed electronic conductivity originated from the entire Ca_{0.85}Sr_{0.15}CuO_{2} film volume, the conductivity would remain constant up to very thin film thicknesses. However, this is not what is observed and the electronic conductivity monotonically increases with the decreasing thickness for 300 and 100 K. This result highlights the fact that only the surface region rather than the bulk volume of the Ca_{0.85}Sr_{0.15}CuO_{2} films contribute to the electronic conduction. It can be seen from data shown in Fig. 19 that this behavior is independent of the growth speed of the Ca_{0.85}Sr_{0.15}CuO_{2} films or the detailed annealing conditions. Instead, the thickness itself is the determining factor of the overall conductivity. As we have already ruled out other factors that are detrimental to the electronic conduction, e.g., defects, our results point towards a surface induced superconductivity that appears after annealing under strong oxidizing conditions. Consequently, a thin surface layer which has been exposed to atomic oxygen flux is responsible for the overall electronic conductivity. The oxygen mobility in cuprates is known to be significantly higher along the CuO_{2} planes as compared to the perpendicular direction. [359] However, the diffusion rate coefficient along grain-boundaries is even higher. [360] We note that elongated annealing times up to 2 h and high atomic oxygen pressures during the annealing process did not trigger any additional conductivity. Despite these attempts to enhance the conductivity in Ca_{0.85}Sr_{0.15}CuO_{2} further, our results are not surprising given the large, single-crystalline domain sizes observed in these films (Fig. 15 and 17). Essentially, the permeability of the CuO_{2} planes for oxygen ions perpendicular to the planes is close to zero with respect to the thermodynamic boundary conditions set forth by the stability criteria of the infinite-layer phase. With this information in mind, we extrapolated the thickness dependency of the resistivity (Fig. 20) linearly towards zero thickness. This extrapolation provides an upper limit for the expected resistivity value at 300 K under the premise that the entire bulk volume of the Ca_{0.85}Sr_{0.15}CuO_{2} thin film would respond identically to its surface. The resistivity value derived from such a simplified approach (150 μΩ cm) is not too far off (80 μΩ cm) from what has been reported for electron-doped infinite-layer Sr_{0.90}La_{0.10}CuO_{2} thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy [15].
DEFECTS IN INFINITE-LAYER CUPRATES
There is a consensus that superconductivity in cuprates occurs in the CuO_{2} planes and it is therefore that any deviation from ideal CuO_{2} planes perturbs the superconducting transition T_{c} the most. As mentioned earlier, the very first reported infinite-layer cuprate, i.e., Ca_{0.86}Sr_{0.14}CuO_{2}, was synthesized under ambient oxygen pressure and the sample did not show any trace of superconductivity. [122] By high-pressure synthesis methods, the Ca:Sr composition can be varied arbitrarily over the entire composition range [361] in bulk materials. For the synthesis of infinite-layer thin films, thin film methods, e.g., MBE or PLD, are commonly used. Electronic transport measurements on defective infinite-layer Ca_{0.61}Sr_{0.32}CuO_{2±}_{δ} and Ca_{0.72}Sr_{0.38}CuO_{2±}_{δ} thin films [362–364] have shown that defects are throughout capable of providing additional charge carriers into the system. For electron-doped infinite-layer cuprates Sr_{1–}_{x}Nd_{x}CuO_{2}, the superconducting transition temperature was found to be independent of x, as long as x >0.05. [365] Extending this finding towards x → 0.00, superconductivity is still to be expected though other influences originating from defects may be superimposed and depressing superconductivity. On the higher doping end, superconductivity appears to suddenly vanish above x ≈0.13 [10,366–370]. The substitution of divalent Sr ions by trivalent Nd ions is what is considered to drive the doping in infinite layer cuprates. But, there is more. For one, the ionic radius of the substituted element is significantly smaller compared to Sr^{2+}, and hence, the bonding environment changes and this is particularly true for high Nd concentrations with x >0.13. These changes drive the infinite layer system, which is already a thermodynamically unstable phase, towards another instability. For Sr_{1–}_{x}CuO_{2–}_{δ}, such a structural phase transition was reported [371] and associated with the disappearance of superconductivity. Moreover, annealing under reducing atmospheres of Ca_{0.30}Sr_{0.70}CuO_{2} and (Ca_{0.30}Sr_{0.70})_{0.95}CuO_{2} [372] showed that superconductivity stems from oxygen-vacancies compensating Ca/Sr defects and these defects are arranged in layers that appear to be randomly distributed. One might speculate that the application of external pressure is a parameter to control superconductivity in infinite-layer cuprates. For electron-doped systems, it was found that the superconducting transition temperature is marginally influenced by external pressure [373,374]. For infinite-layer-(Ca_{0.30}Sr_{0.70})_{0.95}CuO_{2}, an infinite-layer system which is not doped by electrons, T_{c} as high as 120 K under 8 GPa pressure was reported [375,376]. It is worth mentioning that the materials showing such high superconducting transition temperatures are very impure and contained many phases [377,378]. In addition, it was shown that high pressure buckling results in a new polymorph of SrCuO_{2} that coexists with the infinite-layer phase at oxygen pressures of 34 GPa. [379] Attempts to directly observe structural changes subject to the applied pressure in infinite-layer CaCuO_{2} found several phase transitions [47,380] though there are no definitive answers yet to the problem of superconductivity in these structures.
Assuming that the concept of randomly distributed point defects in infinite-layer cuprates holds [381,382], they would lead to the following layer sequence:… A - CuO_{2} - A_{1–}_{z} - CuO_{2–}_{δ} - A_{1–}_{z} - CuO_{2} - A… For such a sequence, the spacing between CuO_{2–}_{δ} would be 3.7 instead of 3.4 Å. [372] An alternative approach [376,383,384], where CuO_{2} planes have been swapped by an oxygen deficit SrO_{1–}_{δ} layer allows for the same conclusion, i.e., the distance between CuO_{2} and the defect layer would be 3.7 Å. The layering sequence for this scenario would be like… Sr - CuO_{2} - SrO_{1–}_{δ} - SrO - SrO_{1–}_{δ} - CuO_{2} - Sr…and this sequence causes that half of the Cu^{2+} ions are no longer square-planar coordinated but pyramidal [385–387]. After all, such a mixed coordination environment is not a strange thing for cuprates as it regularly appears in the Sr_{n}_{+1}Cu_{n}O_{2}_{n}_{+1+}_{δ} phase [388,389]. Unfortunately, there are more defects related to the synthesis of the infinite-layer cuprate phase which are worth being mentioned here [376] and the first one being directly related to (Ca, Sr)_{n}_{+1}Cu_{n}O_{2}_{n}_{+1+}_{δ}. To some extent, this phase is made up from infinite-layer and rock-salt blocks where the stoichiometry (Ca + Sr)/Cu > 1. The second one is related to the Sr_{n}_{–1}Cu_{n}_{+1}O_{2}_{n} homologous series, [390] which is known as a spin-ladder system. The spin-ladder systems have CuO chains alternating with CuO_{2} planes. [391] To make matters worse, there have been even reports [353] on a quasi-infinite-layer structure where every third CuO_{2} plaquette aligns along the (110) direction, thus distorting the infinite network of CuO_{2} planes. Other superstructures, e.g., 22a×22a×c [392,393], have also been linked to oxygen deficiency and its ordering [104,383,394]. One approach to refine and identify defects would be via the determination of the buckling angle [67,75,115,393–400] and its correlation with the superconducting transition temperature. [401]
The emergence of distortions in the infinite-layer crystal structure can be predicted under conditions where ions are limited in forming their equilibrium bond length, since an equal stretching and shrinking of bonds would lead to an enhancement in the average bond valence s. [402] In the case of infinite-layer cuprates, the distortion-free bond length of Ca–O is ℜ=251pm which results in s =0.230 valence units, and this is slightly smaller than the expected value of 0.25. If the displacements of oxygen ions below and above the CuO_{2} planes are 20 pm, one would have four bonds of length ℜ=231pm with s =0.342 valence units and four bonds of ℜ=271pm with s =0.151 valence units and one would end up with a situation where the introduction of a distortion to the CuO_{2} planes increases the average bond valence to 0.246 valence units. Under real experimental conditions, the distortions observed for Ca_{0.85}Sr_{0.15}CuO_{2} are closer to Δ = 10 pm, though such values are sufficient to increase the average bond valence towards its theoretical value of 0.25. The properties of the plane will be similar in all of the CuO_{2} planes in the superconducting cuprate materials [403,404].
After all, it appears that superconductivity preferably exists in samples which are phase pure infinite-layer cuprates but not stoichiometric [13,405,406]. For infinite-layer CaCuO_{2} thin films, it was shown that the oxygen affinity of the Ca layer is primarily responsible for a defect layer that may determine the defect structure of the subsequently deposited layer [403,407,408]. As far as the concept of superlattices is concerned, where infinite-layer cuprates are sandwiched between thermodynamically stable perovskite materials, we may conclude that using superlattices is a useful tool to keep the defects in check [409–411].
CONCLUSION
Due to the ample presence of different crystallographic phases with various stoichiometries for the CaO-CuO, SrO-CuO, SrO-CaO-CuO, and BaO-CuO combinations, we first summarized results from the literature. [412] While data published in the literature are, by far, based on bulk powder synthesis methods, we established thermodynamic constraints for the synthesis of high-quality, single-phase, epitaxial thin films of infinite-layer cuprates, i.e., CaCuO_{2}, SrCuO_{2}, and Ca_{1–}_{x}Sr_{x}CuO_{2}. Subsequently, we discussed the arduousness of the proper oxidation of copper for the formation of the infinite-layer phase cuprates within the boundaries of ultra-high vacuum environments driven by the primal notions of MBE to maintain long mean-free path lengths. Constituent element fluxes are deposited onto substrates using electron beam evaporation. The fluxes are conditioned via an in situ optical feedback system using electron impact emission spectroscopy. For the oxidation of the constituent metal fluxes, we concluded that the oxidizing performance of molecular oxygen is rather poor. Instead, the oxidizing potential of atomic oxygen under ultra-high vacuum is nearly ideal due to the virtual absence of any rate limiting barriers, thus allowing for monotonic oxidation of copper. We analyzed the response and behavior of our custom designed atomic oxygen source in order to determine optimal oxidizing conditions, particularly for the synthesis of infinite-layer cuprates.
In Table V, we collected the electronic response reported for various thin films and superlattice combinations. At a glance, it appears that various concepts and models for the appearance of superconductivity coexist or even contradict each other in the infinite-layer system. In comparison to our results and in agreement to results reported by Castro et_al, [358] minute distortions of the CuO_{2} planes of CaCuO_{2} can be considered as the very origin of this widespread dilemma. In Table V, we also listed data retrieved from a CaCuO_{2} single crystal where bulk-like superconductivity has been reported. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only report available on superconductivity in a single crystal and we caution the validity of this statement. We have shown that the infinite-layer phase of CaCuO_{2} is not stable under ambient conditions and discussed the wide range of possible defects and inter-growth structures that perturb the phase formation under high pressure. While the single crystal of CaCuO_{2} [48,421] has been synthesized using a strongly oxidizing flux composed of BaCuO_{x}, it is likely that the induced superconductivity stems from Ba substitutions in the infinite-layer phase [422–424], thus generating a charge reservoir layer sufficient to preserve the coordination of copper ions. [109] On a final note, we draw a scenario that may present itself as a solution to the dilemma of infinite-layer cuprates. Using MBE for the synthesis of infinite-layer-cuprates allows us to eliminate the growth of macroscopic inter-growth phases rather easily though microscopic defects and their consequences are tough to control or even recognize. The synthesis of infinite-layer-CaCuO_{2} or infinite-layer-SrCuO_{2} requires a strong oxidizing environment in order to maintain square-planar coordinated Cu^{2+} ions. As this process is thermodynamically unstable, defects are created to some extent. While we have discussed a large variety of defects, it is possible to integrate over all defects and consider their net influence. Among all cuprate superconductors, the only cuprates that have no so-called charge reservoir layer are the infinite-layer cuprates, and this requires that the synthesized phase must be, under any circumstances, free from any defects, as Sr^{2+} or Ca^{2+} cannot tolerate charge imbalances stemming from defective CuO_{2} planes. Apparently, there is widespread agreement when it comes to superconductivity in infinite-layer electron-doped cuprates, e.g., Sr_{1–}_{x}La_{x}CuO_{2} [15,103], although the defect concentration is higher in Ref [103] than in Ref [15]. Nonetheless, the fact that the substitution of divalent Sr by trivalent La results in metallic conduction (∂ρ/∂T >0) and superconductivity (ρ = 0 and m = –1/4π) can be considered as a consequence that distortions of the CuO_{2} planes are significantly smaller than what is observed for the bare infinite-layer-SrCuO_{2} material. Under such a scenario, the additional available charges that are doped via the trivalent rare earth element are not dopants but compensation charges. The presence of these compensation charges promotes the growth of the pure infinite-layer phase. In the case of Sr_{1–}_{x}La_{x}CuO_{2}, a doping range of 0.08 < x <0.12 is sufficient to promote the formation of symmetric CuO_{2} planes over large areas and superconductivity is induced [15], and this does not yield prominent changes of the macroscopic crystalline quality. In the case of the Ca-based infinite-layer phase, we observed a significant improvement of the crystal quality in Ca_{1–}_{x}Nd_{x}CuO_{2} upon doping. For Ca_{1–}_{x}Nd_{x}CuO_{2}, the necessary concentration of x for the compensation of charge-imbalances is, however, far beyond the solubility limit or what is tolerable by the infinite-layer phase [24] and this is the primary reason for the absence of superconductivity in infinite-layer-Ca_{1–}_{x}RE_{x}CuO_{2}. Why these doped charges might be considered as an enabler for superconductivity is the real question one has to deal with. [425] Let us assume that the net influence of all possible defects causes a net charge imbalance to the CuO_{2} plane, e.g., CuO2−2+δ. The charge imbalance δ requires to be neutralized in order to fulfill the neutrality criteria. Balancing this charge can be done in several ways, e.g., bond-length variation, buckling, or different stacking sequences. In any case, the very presence of such a charge imbalance results in a distortion of the CuO_{2} plane symmetry and these distortions appear randomly and locally.
For the growth of the infinite-layer phase, CaCuO_{2} layers are supposedly stacked coherently on CaCuO_{2} by adopting the crystallographic information from the preceding CaCuO_{2} layer. In the event of a local defect, every subsequent CaCuO_{2} layer would feel the charge imbalance of the preceding layer and this would prevent the formation of undistorted CuO_{2} planes. In the case of infinite-layer-SrCuO_{2}, the response behavior of the net defect concentration tends to induce a net charge imbalance which is weaker than what is found for infinite-layer-CaCuO_{2}. While even the best infinite-layer-SrCuO_{2} thin films are also not superconducting, a solid solution of Ca and Sr reduces the microscopic defect concentration remarkably, i.e., superconductivity is possible. However, the absolute resistivity values are high and the temperature dependence of the resistivity barely meets the criteria of being called metallic (see Fig. 19). While such Ca_{1–}_{x}Sr_{x}CuO_{2} films are superconducting, the metallic conduction is severely influenced by defects [65], i.e., the residual-resistivity-ratio (RRR) is, at most, 1.3. This brings us now to the next level in this thought pattern. Superlattices of infinite-layer-CaCuO_{2} and SrTiO_{3} throughout are superconducting if an appropriate layer sequence is chosen [403,426,427]. This is also true for superlattices of infinite-layer-SrCuO_{2} and BaCuO_{2}. [162] In such superlattices, the inserted layer material may respond as a charge reservoir layer and this is apparently very important to counterbalance the extra charge δ that stems from crystallographic defects. A similar mechanism may also work in our oxygenated and superconducting Ca_{1–}_{x}Sr_{x}CuO_{2} thin films, e.g., the top-most layer is made up of pyramidally coordinated Cu ions, and this layer serves as a charge-reservoir layer and superconductivity is induced in the second layer. Evidently, this concept is realized nearly to perfection in the Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca_{n}_{–1}Cu_{n}O_{2}_{n}_{+4+}_{δ} systems [428,429] where the infinite-layer-CaCuO_{2} layers are sandwiched by Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CuO_{6} strata. [430] For n =3, the in-plane Cu-Cu distance in a pseudo-tetragonal unit cell is 3.825 Å which is slightly smaller than what is observed for bulk infinite-layer-CaCuO_{2} 3.852 Å [7]. In Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca_{2}Cu_{3}O_{10}, the two BiO layers are the charge reservoir layers and readily absorb any charge imbalance that might originate from the CaCuO_{2} planes. Needless to say, Bi_{2}Sr_{2}Ca_{2}Cu_{3}O_{10} is a superconductor with true metallic conduction above T_{c} ≈ 110 K. As a consequence, one would expect that for infinite-layer-CaCuO_{2}, superconductivity may appear at temperatures even higher than 110 K and this might be possible if one could minimize the concentration of the microscopic defects in infinite-layer-CaCuO_{2} though their detection is still a challenge even with state-of-the-art electron microscopy. Conversely, the induction of superconductivity would not depend on the usage of superlattices or doping. As such charge imbalances are omnipresent in infinite-layer cuprates and the fact that those imbalances are quenched via electron doping provide another clue as to why hole doping into infinite-layer cuprates does not result in metallic conduction or superconductivity. [431] In contrast to electron-doping, hole doping by Li, Na, or K generates an environment that acts as a defect magnifier or enhancer in the infinite-layer system [432–436].
In summary, we have shown that single crystal thin films of the infinite-layer phase of Ca_{1–}_{x}Sr_{x}CuO_{2} can be synthesized by reactive molecular beam epitaxy. First and foremost, the synthesis conditions are determined by x. For small x, strong oxidizing power is required, and for large x, a reduced oxidizing strength supports the formation of the infinite layer phase. In the absence of a superlattice framework wrapping the infinite-layer cuprate thin films, the solid solution Ca_{1–}_{x}Sr_{x}CuO_{2} provides the best thermodynamical environment to minimize microscopic defects and thus induce superconductivity.

In our MBE system (see Fig. 6), two EIES sensors are installed near the substrate in the vapor stream. The optical signal generated by the sensor passes through the feedthrough, then through a fiber optic beam splitter, to multiple detectors (up to 4), each monitoring a different wavelength. Using the measured deposition rate for each material, the controller sends a control signal to each material's high-voltage power source, to control individual and total deposition rates. A quartz-crystal microbalance (QCM) is commonly used to calibrate the deposition rates measured by the EIES. A software package seamlessly integrates QCM and EIES functions for calibration and control.

For x =0.00 (a), the supplied Ca:Cu stoichiometry is larger than 1 to compensate for re-evaporation losses of Ca from the film surface. The loss of Ca is likely due to the concomitant formation of volatile CaO_{2} and this loss has to be compensated also for the synthesis of Ca_{0.96}Sr_{0.06}CuO_{2} and Ca_{0.40}Sr_{0.60}CuO_{2}, where the Cu:Ca stoichiometries are 1:0.95 and 1:0.87, respectively. The rates are tuned to allow the growth of approx. 10 nm/min.
