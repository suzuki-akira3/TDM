An investigation into the dielectric and electrical properties of LaErO_{3} and LaHoO_{3} rare earth perovskites
We have investigated the electrical and dielectric properties of rare earth perovskites-type oxide (LaErO_{3} and LaHoO_{3}) by using impedance spectroscopy, respectively, over a frequency and temperature range of [0.6 kHz–8 MHz] and [673–973 K]. Both oxides crystallize in the orthorhombic structure but exhibit difference in lattice distortions. A correlation between structural properties and dielectric anisotropies is carried out. The analysis of Nyquist semicircles confirms the presence of bulk effects and non-Debye relaxation processes for both compounds. The activation energy, calculated using relaxation time and direct current conductivity models, was found to follow the Arrhenius law. The frequency dependence of alternative current conductivity is described by Jonscher's universal power law and shows that the conduction mechanism follows the non-overlapping small polaron tunneling model. The investigation of dielectric properties revealed that at low frequencies the dielectric constant was higher for LaHoO_{3} oxide than that for LaErO_{3}. Modulus formalism examination demonstrates that the relaxation process of studied materials takes place via the hopping mechanism.
I. INTRODUCTION
Dielectric materials include compounds having a large energy gap and high electric resistivity. They represent efficient insulators that impede electrical charge transfer and insure its storage [1]. Previously, silicates have been found to be thermally stable dielectric high-k gate materials and have been used for application in metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) [2–5]. However, new requirements have been imposed by the miniaturization of integrated circuits sizes, which make the silicate materials' performances insufficient to fulfill the prerequisite of new technologies [6]. In fact, an efficient dielectric material requires a high dielectric constant, a thermal and a chemical stability, and smooth morphology of thin layers [7]. As the gate-oxide thickness is decreased, the silicate oxides' dielectric constant is reduced. For this reason, numerous materials like polymers, GaAs, zirconium, hafnium, and rare earth oxides have been studied in order to make up for the silicates' weaknesses [8]. The rare earth sesquioxides, type Ln_{2}O_{3} (Ln: lanthanide), form adequate materials for dielectric applications as they are characterized by a large bandgap, thermodynamical stability, a relatively high dielectric constant, and a good structural compatibility with silicon oxides in comparison with some materials, like polymers or GaAs semi-conductors [9,10]. However, some of them, like La_{2}O_{3}, have the disadvantage of being hygroscopic, which affects the chemical stability and the surface properties with silicon. Therefore, ternary rare earth oxides have been used to replace such materials, given that the combination of two or more sesquioxides can introduce new dielectric performances and present better chemical stability compared to binary oxides [11,12].
In the present paper, we are particularly interested in studying experimental dielectric properties of LaBO_{3} (B = Er, Ho) perovskites since only a theoretical approach to these materials has been reported in the literature by Coh et_al [13]
We took advantage of thermal stability of rare earth perovskite type oxides in order to operate in a relatively high temperature range between 673 and 973 K, which is adequate for some applications like implementation of transistor amplifiers [5]. The electric properties were also investigated using the impedance spectroscopy. This method describes the electrical processes occurring in a system by applying an alternative current (AC) signal as an input perturbation. The main target of this work is to report new elucidation of electrical and dielectric properties concerning the conduction mechanism, the nature of polarizations, relaxation process, and dielectric loss.
II. EXPERIMENTAL
The synthesis of studied perovskites-type oxides LaBO_{3} (B = Er, Ho) was performed using the combustion method. The preparation process as well as characterization of these components was described in previous works [14,15]. The electrical measurements were carried out using an impedance analyzer (Agilent 4294A) by applying an alternating current (AC) within the frequency range from 625 Hz to 8 MHz and by varying temperature from 673 to 973 K. The specimen pellet was maintained between two platinum electrodes in sandwich geometry. The sample has a disk form with a diameter and a thickness of, respectively, 12 and 0.5 mm.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Structural properties
The structural properties deduced by X-ray diffraction analysis and Rietveld refinement of the studied oxides have been treated in earlier reports [14,15]. The LaErO_{3} and LaHoO_{3} oxides, noted in this paper LEr and LHo, were found to crystallize in the orthorhombic structure with Pnam and Pnma space groups, respectively. The Ho^{3+} and Er^{3+} ions occupy an octahedral site type BO_{6}, and La^{3+} is 12-coordinated by the anions (O^{2−}) in the lattice. Table I reports structural parameters of both the studied compounds. From this table, it is shown that the cell volume of LHo is higher than that of LEr oxide. These two perovskites display a deviation from the ideal cubic to orthorhombic structure since the Goldschmidt tolerance factor “t_{g}” is lower than unity [16]. This factor is calculated based on the following equation:
where r_{La}, r_{B}, and r_{O} are, respectively, the ionic radii of La^{3+}, Er^{3+} or Ho^{3+}, and O^{2−}. In fact, the tolerance factor decreases from 0.843 for LEr to 0.838 for LHo due to the difference in ionic radius of ion occupying the octahedral site: r_{Er} = 0.881 Å for Er^{3+} and r_{Ho} = 0.894 Å for Ho^{3+} [17].
The difference in perovskite structure between the considered oxides was further demonstrated by calculating angles connecting adjacent clusters type BO_{6}, as illustrated in Fig. 1 and Table I. A view along the [001] direction shows that both oxides induce structural distortions, which is revealed by a rotation around the z-axis and the difference in α and α′ angles [Figs. 1(a) and 1(b)]. Moreover, Figs. 1(c) and 1(d) show that octahedral tilting of adjacent clusters [ErO_{6}]–[ErO_{6}] and [HoO_{6}]–[HoO_{6}] (belonging to two different planes) can occur, which is highlighted by the difference in β and β′ angles. Such distortions in perovskite cells might have effects on electrical or dielectric properties, which we will treat further up in this paper.
B. Electrical study
1. Impedance spectroscopy
The impedance spectroscopy is a useful method to characterize the conduction mechanism and electrical properties of a given material. The variation of imaginary part (−Z″) versus the real part (Z′) of the complex impedance (Z*) allows the representation of Cole–Cole plots (Nyquist plots) as shown in Fig. 2. At low temperatures, we see almost straight lines of (−Z″) versus Z′, indicating a high insulating behavior in both LEr and LHo oxide. As the temperature increases, the curves represent depressed semicircles with a center lying under the Z′ axis, indicating a non-Debye relaxation process [18,19].
Moreover, as the temperature rises, the diameter of semi-circles decreases, which is linked to the decline of resistance, obtained by the point of intercept of semicircles with the real impedance axis.
Nyquist representations illustrate that both oxides have singular semicircle, suggesting that equivalent electrical circuit can be modeled by a parallel combination of a bulk resistance (Rb) and a constant phase element (CPE). The CPE element was considered instead of bulk capacitance in order to take into account the semi-circle depression and the deviation from an ideal model. Consequently, the total complex impedance is written as follows:
where the impedance of constant phase element Z_{CPE} is explicitly expressed by this formula [20]
A_{0} is a constant independent of frequency, which indicates the value of the CPE element capacitance (F cm^{−2} s^{n-1}). j is the imaginary number (j^{2} = −1) and ω is an angular frequency (ω = 2.π.f). The “n” parameter, ranging between zero and unity, describes the deviation from a perfect capacitor or an ideal resistor, which is obtained, respectively, when n = 1 or n = 0. Based on Eq. (2), both the real and imaginary parts of the complex impedance are fitted versus frequency using the following relations:
As observed in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b), there is a good agreement between theoretical (solid line) and experimental values, thus confirming that the equivalent circuit can be modeled by the combination of parallel bulk resistance and CPE element. We represent in Fig. 2(c) the fitted semi-circles registered at the same temperature (873 K). From these results, we note that the resistance of LaHoO_{3} oxide is significantly lower than that of LaErO_{3} compound, indicating that the last oxide is more resistive. The resulting fitting parameters (R_{b}, A_{0}, and n) of both oxides at 873 K are represented in Table II. The capacitance values A_{0} have a magnitude of 10^{−10} F cm^{−2} S^{n-1}, which means that the obtained semicircles represent the grain response of the system [21].
Figure 3 illustrates the variation of the impedance imaginary part (Z″) at various temperatures. With increasing temperature, we see that there is a decrease of Z″ magnitude and that all the peaks exhibit asymmetric broadening and shift toward higher frequencies. Hence, we notice that the temperature depends on the electrical relaxation phenomenon and that the broadening peaks suggest the presence of multiple relaxation processes, which means that there is a distribution of relaxation time (τ) [22]. Indeed, from Z″ curves, we can deduce the most probable value of τ [23], which is an important parameter that depends, basically, on material properties and characterizes the probabilities of dipoles transition and rotation activated by the temperature increase [24]. This parameter is calculated using the following equation:
where f_{max} is the relaxation frequency. In a different way, the relaxation time (τ) follows the Arrhenius equation, as illustrated below
The semi-logarithmic variation of relaxation time with the inverse of the absolute temperature is given in Fig. 4. An almost linear decrease of relaxation time with temperature increase is obtained for both oxides. This decline reveals the existence of temperature dependence on the electrical relaxation that can be related to dissipated thermal energy induced by the movement of the alternating field and the appearance of dipoles [25]. From the slope of linear curves, we calculate the activation energy of Debye relaxation E_{a}, which is equivalent to 0.72 and 0.69 eV for LEr and LHo, respectively.
2. Conductivity analyses
In order to identify the electrical transport mechanism, we have studied the total alternative current (σ_{AC}) conductivity variation depending on frequency. The σ_{AC} conductivity calculation is based on complex impedance results, as illustrated below
where A is the specimen pellet sample area and t is its thickness.
Figures 5(a) and 5(b) show that the semi-logarithmic variation of total conductivity as a function of frequency presents two regions for both oxides: the first is an independent low frequency domain, which refers to pure direct current conductivity (σ_{DC}). The σ_{DC} conductivity describes the charge carrier displacements and follows the Arrhenius law, as illustrated by the following equation:
where σ_{DC} is calculated by extrapolating curves to the conductivity axis at low frequency. Figure 6(a) shows that σ_{DC} decreases linearly with the inverse of temperature increase. The activation energy of DC conductivity E_{σ}, deduced from the slopes, is evaluated to 0.73 and 0.71 eV for LEr and LHo, respectively. Consequently, the activation energy is found to be lower for oxide (LaHoO_{3}) having a higher magnitude of conductivity, which correlates with the previous results [26]. In fact, the increase in electric conductivity can be linked to LHo matrix distortion that entails a delocalization of charge carrier dipole [27]. According to previous works carried out by Hayashi et_al [28], the correlation between the electrical conductivity and structural parameters of perovskite lattices has been widely discussed. It has been proved that many factors like lattice stability (tolerance factor) and the specific free volume can affect the electrical conductivity. In this work, the LHo lattice exhibits a larger deformation from the ideal cubic structure, manifested by a lower tolerance factor compared to LEr oxide. As the Ho^{3+} ion occupying the B site has higher ionic radius than Er^{3+}, the specific free volume gets larger, which is favorable for obtaining higher electrical conductivity [28].
For the sake of comparison, we note that the activation energy calculated from Log(σ_{DC}) is almost close to the one determined from the Log(τ) plot. This similarity indicates that the same energy barriers in the perovskite structure are involved in both the relaxation and the conduction processes [29].
As for the second region of σ_{AC} curve (Fig. 5), we observe an increase of conductivity as a function of frequency. Consequently, the AC conductivity equation can be described by the known universal Jonscher power law, as illustrated in the equation [30,31]
where ω is the angular frequency (Hz) and K pre-factor, which depends on the temperature and lattice composition and indicates the strength of the polarizability. The frequency exponent s shows the interaction degree between charge carriers with the lattice [32].
In order to define the conduction mechanism, we suggest studying the variation of s parameter with temperature. According to literature, various theoretical models can be suggested to interpret the relation between conductivity and temperature variation of s parameter. These models consist of the following:
• Quantum mechanical tunneling (QMT) model: s is almost equal to 0.8 and increases slightly with temperature [33].
• The correlated barrier hopping (CBH) model is obtained when s is found to decrease with increasing temperature [34].
• The overlapping large polaron tunneling (OLPT) model concerns the conduction mechanism when the exponent s is both temperature and frequency dependent. It is found to decrease with temperature increase until a minimum value and then to go up as the temperature rises [35].
• The non-overlapping small polaron tunneling (NSPT) characterized by the increase of s exponent with temperature [36].
Figure 6(b) depicts the variation of the frequency exponent s parameter with temperature. It is seen that s values are lying under unity, indicating the non-Debye process of the studied oxides [37]. Moreover, the s values tend to increase with temperature. Thus, the frequency dependence of σ_{AC}(f) region is governed by the non-overlapping small polaron tunneling (NSPT) mechanism. This model describes that the charge carrier transport mechanism is governed by small polaron tunneling through barrier and defines the exponent s parameter according to the following relation:
where E_{a} is the polaron hopping energy and τ_{0} is a characteristic relaxation time. The NSPT model supposes that the overlapping level of columbic potential wells increases with temperature. It also assumes that each dipole has a relaxation time depending on its activation energy that is due to a potential barrier [38]. From, Fig. 6(b), it is clear that s exponent increases slightly with temperature for LEr compound, whereas it increases more rapidly for the LHo perovskite. This behavior can explain the difference in conductivity magnitude between the studied oxides. At the same temperature, the conductivity was found to be much higher for LaHoO_{3} compared to LaErO_{3} oxide.
C. Dielectric study
1. Permittivity and loss studies
The complex permittivity (ε*) can be written according to the following equations [39,40]:
where the frequency dependent real part ε′(f) and the imaginary number ε″(f) are, respectively, defined as the dielectric constant and the dielectric loss. The C_{0} parameter is the capacitance of the empty cell (C_{0}=ε_{0}At) and ε_{0} is the vacuum permittivity.
In general, the dielectric constant reflects the response of a material charge under an applied electric field. Depending on the frequency of experienced field, the dielectric constant response originates from polarization of different sorts like interfacial, dipolar, ionic, or electronic [41,42]. At low frequency, interfacial and dipolar polarizations are predominant. However, at high frequencies (∼ 10^{12} Hz), the electronic polarization becomes responsible for the dielectric response.
From Figs. 7(a) and 7(c), we note that at low frequency there is an increase of the dielectric constant with temperature for both LEr and LHo oxides, which can be caused by the charge contribution of all components on polarization or the accumulation of the charge at the interface electrode-electrolytes. In fact, in the presence of electric field, a space charge polarization is created at the interface between electrode and electrolyte and results in a polarization of ionic medium. These charges are able to move easily at lower frequencies inducing high polarization and consequently provoking a dielectric constant increase. At higher frequencies, the decrease of dielectric constant can be linked to the drop of dipoles number involved in polarization or to the reduction of charge carrier accumulation that appears at the interface electrolyte-electrode.^{22}
Besides, we see that at the same temperature (973 K), the ε′ magnitude of LHo around 1 kHz is significantly higher than that for LEr. This observation can be related to the fact that the lattice cell volume of LHo is larger than LEr and that the lattice distortion induces a higher polarization and contributes to the dielectric response enhancement.^{13}^{}A relationship between the Goldschmidt tolerance factor t_{g} and the dielectric constant ε′ of complex perovskites has been reported by Ian et_al [43] They proved that the steady increase of dielectric constant is associated with the decrease of tolerance factor, and hence, with the lattice distortion enhancement, which is in agreement with our results. The anisotropy in dielectric constant between the studied oxides can also be attributed to space charge polarization that originates from pellet porosity or in homogeneities in the grain structure [44].
Figures 7(b) and 7(d) reveal the dielectric loss variation (ε″) with frequency. It is observed that for both oxides that ε″ decreases continuously with frequency increase, which indicates that dielectric loss is frequency dependent. Besides, we note a rise in ε″ with temperature at low frequencies that can be linked to the electrode polarization effects [45] or to the grain boundaries requiring high energy to move the charge carriers [22].
By comparing the dielectric loss curves registered for the studied compounds, one can see that at the same temperature, ε″ magnitude is higher for LHo oxide than for LEr. Hence, this difference can be related to the higher conductivity of LHo oxide compared to LEr one [46,47].
The dielectric loss called, also, loss factor tangent can be observed when the relaxation time and the frequency of the applied field are similar, which is expressed by the following equation:
From Figs. 8(a) and 8(b), we see that the semi-logarithmic variation of loss tangent (tan δ) versus frequency presents a monotonic decrease for LEr oxide with the rise of temperature. However, the LHo oxide represents a bump that appears when the temperature is below 873 K and whose position tends to shift to lower frequencies when the temperature decreases. At low frequencies, the loss factor tangent is found to be higher for LHo compared to LEr, which is due to the higher electrical conduction of the first oxide compared to the second one [46].
Since the dielectric loss maximum shifts monotonically to lower temperatures with declining frequency, we could attribute this dielectric dispersion to a thermally activated process.
Both oxides present a tail at higher frequency that is linked to a low dielectric relaxation and the dissipation of energy in dielectric systems. This behavior corresponds to the Maxwell-Wagner mechanism [48] and was more likely associated with the fact that hopping of electrons between ionic sites is almost equal to the applied field frequency [49,50]. For both oxides, we see that the dielectric loss at low frequency takes relatively high values due probably to the implication of a conduction loss [51].
2. Complex modulus
The complex modulus (M*) is a very useful formalism to investigate the dielectric relaxation process, and it is an appropriate approach for the elimination of electrode and interface effects [52]. In order to analyze the dielectric relaxation mechanism, we have studied the frequency dependence of imaginary modulus, where the formalism of the complex modulus can be written as follows:
From Figs. 9(a) and 9(b), we note that at low temperatures (673 K), the imaginary modulus (M″) values are very low, indicating the freezing of dipoles in grain boundaries. The modulus keeps the same aspect for LEr oxide until 753 K, while it shows a bump at 713 K for LHo. As the temperature increases, the imaginary part of M″ displays a peak that appears at 793 K for LEr and at 713 K for LHo and that shifts towards higher frequencies. From this modulus behavior, one can note that LHo oxide implicates more prominent dipoles activation at lower temperature, compared to LEr oxide, which can be due to its higher conductivity. The peak shift to higher frequencies suggests that the dielectric relaxation is thermally activated and that is dominated by the charge carrier hopping mechanism.
In the M″ spectra, we see that for both oxides, the low-frequency region (below the peak) of the imaginary part M″ indicates that the charge carriers are mobile over long distances from one site to a neighboring site, while in the high-frequency region (above the peak), the carriers were spatially confined to potential wells and become mobile over a short distance [53]. Then, the presence of the peaks indicates that charge carriers undergo a transition from long-to-short range mobility as the frequency increases. This behavior suggests the existence of a temperature dependent charge carrier hopping mechanism for electrical conduction (charge transport).The asymmetric peaks, obtained for both oxides, suppose the dominance of non-Debye multi-relaxation process that takes place along with a spread of relaxation time [54]. The nature of modulus curves indicates that the electrical conduction of the studied materials is described by the hopping mechanism.
By comparing the modulus spectra of the studied oxides in the range of temperature from 673 to 973 K, we note that for both oxides, the peaks are broader and asymmetric, which indicates the spread of relaxation time [55]. The imaginary modulus M″ of LEr oxide presents double Debye asymmetric peak, resulting from two overlapped peaks that can be associated with the application of two-relaxation processes i.e., the electrode and grain boundaries [23,56].
Besides, as the LEr is kept almost the same appearance of double Debye asymmetric peaks, indicating the transition from long range to short range mobility, the LHo shows the appearance of a single peak. With increasing temperature, the M″ curve shape of LHo oxide changes. At low temperatures, we see the right side of M″ peak and then a single peak at 793 K, followed by the appearance of the left side of modulus curve at high temperatures. This behavior suggests the dominance of short range charge carrier contribution in the conduction mechanism at low temperatures and a long range charge carrier mobility toward higher temperatures [57]. Meanwhile, the peak tops are higher for LHo, whereas the peak shapes are broader for LEr, indicating a wider distribution of relaxation times in comparison to LHo.
As shown in Sec. III C, the dielectric properties of the studied oxides have several anisotropies: the LHo oxide was found to have higher lattice distortion than the LEr oxide, which is marked by a lower tolerance factor that contributes to the increase of dielectric constant. The dielectric loss of LHo is higher than that of LEr oxide, which is attributed to the high conductivity of the first compound.
The interpretation of the imaginary Modulus results shows that the dielectric relaxation is thermally activated, dominated by the charge carrier hopping mechanism, and that dipoles activation is more significant for LHo compared to LEr.
IV. CONCLUSION
Impedance spectroscopy of LaBO_{3} (B = Er, Ho) perovskites type oxide has been analyzed in order to investigate electrical and dielectric properties. The Nyquist semicircles revealed that the equivalent electrical circuit comprises a parallel combination of a bulk resistance and a constant phase element. The alternative current conductivity has been found to follow the Jonscher power law. The activation energy has been calculated based on Arrhenius law applied on direct current conductivity (σ_{DC}) and relaxation time (τ). These two methods give the same activation energies for both oxides. This phenomenon was attributed to the fact that the same activation barrier is involved in both the relaxation and the conduction processes. The frequency dependence of σ_{AC}(f) region suggests the non-overlapping small polaron tunneling (NSPT) conduction mechanism. The dielectric constant of LHo oxide is more prominent than for LEr. Thus, it confirms the theoretical results previously reported in the literature. A correlation between the dielectric results and the structural properties presumes that higher lattice volume induces a higher polarization and contributes to the dielectric response and conductivity enhancement. The modulus investigation shows the presence of a temperature-dependent hopping type mechanism for electrical conduction for both oxides.
