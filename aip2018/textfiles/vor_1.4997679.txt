Stochastic multiresonance in coupled excitable FHN neurons
In this paper, effects of noise on Watts-Strogatz small-world neuronal networks, which are stimulated by a subthreshold signal, have been investigated. With the numerical simulations, it is surprisingly found that there exist several optimal noise intensities at which the subthreshold signal can be detected efficiently. This indicates the occurrence of stochastic multiresonance in the studied neuronal networks. Moreover, it is revealed that the occurrence of stochastic multiresonance has close relationship with the period of subthreshold signal T_{e} and the noise-induced mean period of the neuronal networks T_{0}. In detail, we find that noise could induce the neuronal networks to generate stochastic resonance for M times if T_{e} is not very large and falls into the interval (M×T_{0},(M+1)×T_{0}) with M being a positive integer. In real neuronal system, subthreshold signal detection is very meaningful. Thus, the obtained results in this paper could give some important implications on detecting subthreshold signal and propagating neuronal information in neuronal systems.
I. INTRODUCTION
Noise exists everywhere in nonlinear dynamical systems and is always considered to be destructive. However, in the past, it is found that noise could also play constructive roles [1,2]. One of the most famous examples is the stochastic resonance (SR) phenomenon [3,4]. SR phenomenon manifests that feeble input information (such as a weak signal) can be amplified by optimal intensity of additive noise. In other words, weak signal can be detected with the aid of some appropriate noise level. Due to its potential applications in different fields [5], stochastic resonance has attracted continuous attention both theoretically [6–8] and experimentally [9–11] over the past decades. Theoretical research of SR starts from discrete two-state model [12] to continuous bistable systems [13–15]. Afterwards, experimental studies on SR are more widespread in optical systems [16], electronic and magnetic systems [17,18], and neural systems.
Especially in neuronal systems, neuronal firing dynamics has a characteristic of bistability, so that SR phenomenon could be induced by noise and has been widely investigated [19–21]. Many physiological experiments have been shown that the ability of sensory neurons to process weak input signals can be significantly enhanced by adding noise to the system [22–25]. In addition, mathematical models have been also established to study the effect of time-delay or hybrid synapse on SR [26–29]. Furthermore, SR phenomenon can be used for understanding the weak signal detection and information propagation [30–32].
Moreover, Vilar and Rubí astonishingly revealed that response of a single element model stimulated by subthreshold periodic signals may be enhanced at multiple values of the noise level [33]. They referred this phenomenon as stochastic multiresonance (SMR). After that, SMR has been reported in several models and systems, for example, Landau-Lifschitz equation [34], system with hopping energy levels [35], single-mode laser model [36–38], hepatocyte model [39], bistable system [40,41], etc. Moreover, dynamical features of nonlinear system are also found to have great influences on the occurrence of SMR. For example, it is found that the hepatocyte model can generate an extra resonance peak in the relative smaller noise intensity and exhibit stochastic biresonance (SBR) when the dynamical parameters are extremely closed to the Hopf-bifurcation point [39]. Besides single element model, SMR has also be found in networks, such as one dimension chain [42,43], scale-free network coupling with Ising models [44], and hierarchical network consisting of threshold elements [45].
Remarkably, the system manifesting SMR has better capacity for detecting and propagating signals [46,47], since there exists several optimal noise intensities at which the subthreshold signal can be detected efficiently. Therefore, more and more researchers are inspired to study SMR [48–55]. However, stochastic multiresonance in excitable neuronal networks is still not deeply studied [56]. In this paper, we devote for studying stochastic multiresonance in a small-world neuronal network, which is locally modelled by FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) neuronal model. And besides additive noise, each single neuron is also stimulated by a weak sinusoid weak signal. We will reveal that this neuronal network could exhibit stochastic bi-resonance or stochastic tri-resonance (STR) with regard to different values of the period of subthreshold signal. And with further analysis, we show that the occurrence of SMR is affected by two factors—the period of subthreshold signal T_{e} and the system parameter a.
Finally, the organizational structure of this paper is given as follows: In Sec. II, each neuron of the small-world neuronal network is stimulated by a subthreshold signal and an additive independent noise. Meanwhile, Fourier coefficient of the mean field of membrane potential in the neuronal system is introduced to quantify the correlation between the system response and the subthreshold signal. In Sec. III, effects of noise on the neuronal network are studied in detail. The obtained results will show that noise could induce the studied neuronal network to generate stochastic bi-resonance or tri-resonance. That is to say, in this section, we will see that noise could induce stochastic multiresonance. Moreover, some explanations are presented to try to make the occurrence of noise-induced SMR be understood much easily. Finally, a brief discussion and conclusion are drawn in Sec. IV.
II. MODEL AND METHODS
A. Neuronal network model
The FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model [57,58] is used to describe the local single neuron, and equations of the neuronal network are presented as follows:
where x_{i} represents the action potential and is fast variable of the i–th neuron, and y_{i} represents the slow recovery variable, i=1,2,…,N. N is the total number of neurons contained in the network. The fast and slow variables are separated by the small parameter ε, which is set as 0.01. Depending on the system parameter a, each individual neuron exhibits either oscillatory (|a|<1.0) or excitable (|a|>1.0) behavior. In this work, we fix that all units are in excitable regime with a = 1.1 without special demonstration. Thus, each neuron in the neuronal network is in a resting state, unless there are some external stimuli. One of the stimuli is channel noise that is caused by the random flow of ions passing through ion channels and the random open/close of ion channels. In neuronal model, channel noise ξ_{i}(t) is usually introduced into slow variables and is set to be Gaussian noise with ⟨ξ_{i}(t)⟩=0 and ⟨ξ_{i}(t)ξ_{j}(t′)⟩=δ_{ij}δ(t−t′). D is the noise intensity. Asin(2πT_{e}t) is a subthreshold signal with period T_{e}. In other words, without noise ξ_{i}(t), signal Asin(2πT_{e}t) is not capable of triggering neurons to generate any spikes. The threshold of amplitude A_{th} for different period T_{e} is shown in Fig. 1. As shown in Fig. 1, Asin(2πT_{e}t) is a subthreshold signal when (T_{e},A) is located in the gray area. For example, when the signal period T_{e} = 9, the amplitude A can be set as 0.13 to make Asin(2πT_{e}t) be a subthreshold signal.
In this paper, the neuronal network is considered as a small-world network with N = 200 neurons. To obtain a small-world neuronal network, we follow the random rewiring procedure proposed by Watts and Strogatz [59]. Starting from a ringlike network with regular connectivity, where each unit is connected to its k = 20 nearest neighbors, we rewire each edge randomly with the probability p. By increasing the probability p, the architecture of network is tuned between two extremes: regular (p = 0) and random (p = 1) networks. For 0<p<1, the resulting networks show small-world property. In the following, the rewiring probability is set as p = 0.15 without specified. J=(J_{ij}) is a connection matrix: J_{ij}=J_{ji}=1 if neuron i is connected to neuron j, J_{ij} = 0 otherwise, and J_{ii} = 0. And the coupling strength g is set as 0.015 throughout the paper.
In the followings, stochastic Euler algorithm is applied to numerically solve equations of the neuronal network with a fixed time step of 0.001. Meanwhile, the initial values are set as x_{i}(0)=0,y_{i}(0)=0.
B. Measure
To quantitatively characterize stochastic resonance phenomenon, we calculate the Fourier coefficient Q. It reflects the correlation of temporal output series of X(t) with subthreshold signal Asin(2πT_{e}t), which is defined as
where [0,T] is the integral interval. And X(t)=1N∑i=1Nx_{i}(t) is the mean field of membrane potential of neurons inside the network. Large Q indicates both resonance of the entire neuronal network and the strong capability of detecting signal. In most of the instances, the system's response to subthreshold signal exhibits SR phenomenon, which was sufficiently discussed in Ref [3]. In this paper, the classical stochastic resonance (SR) phenomenon happens if the Fourier coefficient Q has a local maximum with increasing of noise intensity D, seeing the inset of Fig. 7 for a reference. And if the Fourier coefficient Q has several local maxima with increasing of noise intensity D, then it indicates the occurrence of SMR. In Secs. III A–III D, to calculate Q, the time span T for recording membrane potentials x_{i}(t)(i=1,…,N) is set as 500. And the final results (except the figure of time series of one arbitrary neuron) are obtained by averaging over 10 independent runs to warrant appropriate statistical accuracy with respect to the small-world network generation and numerical stimulation of the Gaussian noise.
In addition, inter-spike interval (ISI), which can describe the important feature of time series X(t), is depicted by the time interval between two contiguous firings. Suppose the k−th firing moment of the i−th neuron is denoted by t_{i}(k) when membrane voltage x_{i}(t) increases from negative to positive, then ISIs of the i−th neuron can be calculated by ΔT_{i}(k)=t_{i}(k+1)−t_{i}(k) with k≥1 being an integer. In the following of the paper, distribution of ISIs is adopted to explain the occurrence of SMR.
III. RESULTS
In this section, we will exhibit the results of stochastic multiresonance (SMR) phenomenon in coupled excitable FHN systems. At first, stochastic multiresonance is discovered by calculating the Fourier coefficient Q with respect to noise intensity D. And in order to show detailed information of noise-induced stochastic multiresonance, time series of mean field X(t) is also depicted for some values of D. Then, we try to give some explanations of the noise-induced SMR through analyzing inter-spike intervals (ISIs) of the neuronal networks. Afterwards, we investigate the effects of period T_{e} of the subthreshold signal and system parameter a on this phenomenon in Subsections III C and III D.
A. Noise-induced stochastic multiresonance
In this subsection, for the purpose of discovering noise-induced stochastic multiresonance, we will focus on investigating effects of noise intensity D on the Fourier coefficient Q under the subthreshold signal Asin(2πT_{e}t) for two values of period T_{e}. One is T_{e} = 9, and the other is T_{e} = 14. In the following, we will show that noise could induce stochastic bi-resonance when T_{e} = 9 and tri-resonance when T_{e} = 14, respectively.
Dependence of Q with respect to D is calculated for T_{e} = 9 at first, as shown in Fig. 2. Here, as depicted in Fig. 1, the amplitude A is set as 0.13 for T_{e} = 9 in order to ensure the signal being subthreshold (the threshold is 0.136). From Fig. 2, we can see that with increasing D, there exist two optimal values of noise intensity D at which the Fourier coefficient Q reaches to local maximum, one is at relatively small noise intensity D = 0.005 and the other is at relatively large noise intensity D = 0.04. That means, the neuronal system exhibits stochastic bi-resonance. At these two values of noise intensity D, correlation between the mean field X(t) and the subthreshold signal Asin(2πT_{e}t) becomes stronger, and detecting the weak signal by the neuronal network is more efficient. Moreover, as exhibited in Fig. 2, a wider range of noise intensity D around D = 0.04 is available for detecting the external subthreshold signal.
Furthermore, corresponding to Fig. 2, the mean field X(t) for five different values of D is depicted to illustrate noise-induced bi-resonance much more clearly, as shown in Fig. 3. When D = 0, there is no noise in the system. Because all neurons are excitable and the external signal is subthreshold, all neurons could not generate any spikes. Thus, X(t) just oscillates around resting potential slightly, as exhibited in Fig. 3(a). When D increases to D = 0.005, around which Q reaches to the first local maximum, mean field X(t) generates periodic firing activities, as presented in Fig. 3(b). Here, the period of X(t) is nearly equal to the period of subthreshold signal T_{e} = 9. Namely, under the noise intensity around 0.005, mean field X(t) has strong correlation with the subthreshold signal. Therefore, Q reaches local maximum and the subthreshold signal can be detected effectively. Then, noise intensity D is increased further to 0.02, and X(t) becomes irregular [see also Fig. 3(c)], which results in the weak correlation between X(t) and the external subthreshold signal. However, once we increase D further to nearly 0.04, a surprising phenomenon appears—Q reaches another local maximum. With time series of X(t) at D = 0.04 exhibited in Fig. 3(d), it can be seen that X(t) becomes periodic again. And the period of X(t) is again approximately equal to the period of subthreshold signal T_{e}. Then, the subthreshold signal can also be detected effectively at this noise intensity. However, different from Fig. 3(b), there are two contiguous spikes in one period instead of one. In this paper, we call it as period-2 firing activity. Mean field of the system is totally turbulent when D increases to much large values, as shown in Fig. 3(e). It means that the system fails to detect subthreshold signal with large enough noise intensity.
Next, dependence of Q with respect to D is presented for T_{e} = 14, as shown in Fig. 4. Here, in order to ensure that the external signal being subthreshold, the amplitude A is set as 0.14 for T_{e} = 14 (the threshold is 0.144 for T_{e} = 14, as depicted in Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 4, Q could reach three local maxima with the increasing of D. It indicated that noise could induce the considered neuronal system to generate stochastic resonance three times, which is called as stochastic tri-resonance. And the three optimal values of D, which correspond to the three local maxima of Q, are approximately 0.001, 0.018, and 0.04, respectively. Similar as the case for T_{e} = 9, around D = 0.04, Q could stay at large values in a wide range of noise intensity D.
Corresponding to Fig. 4, time series of the mean field X(t) for seven different values of D are exhibited in Fig. 5. In Fig. 5(a), X(t) just oscillates slightly around resting potential when D = 0. When D increases a little to 0.001, X(t) generates periodic activities. And the period of X(t) is nearly equal to T_{e} = 14, as shown in Fig. 5(b). It indicates that the subthreshold signal can be detected effectively under this noisy condition. With increasing D further to D = 0.004, X(t) becomes irregular, i.e., correlation between X(t) and the subthreshold signal Asin(2πT_{e}t) becomes weak. Thus, detecting subthreshold signal becomes difficult. Moreover, when D increases to 0.018, X(t) generates periodic behavior again, as exhibited in Fig. 5(d). And the period of X(t) is also approximately T_{e}. In this case, the subthreshold signal can be detected successfully. However, when D increases again to 0.024, then X(t) fails to generate periodic activities, which results in the failure of detecting subthreshold signal. And then the correlation between X(t) and the subthreshold signal becomes weak again. And with increasing of D again to 0.04, X(t) can also generate periodic activities, as presented in Fig. 5(f). The period of this activity is also nearly T_{e}. And for very large D, e.g., D = 0.1, noise plays a dominant role and X(t) becomes disordered, as shown in Fig. 5(g). Therefore, as noise intensity D increases from zero, the neuronal system could successfully detect the subthreshold signal three times, which results in three local maxima of Q. And similar as the results presented in Fig. 3, the periodic activities of X(t) corresponding to these three local maxima of Q are different from each other. For D = 0.001, X(t) generates period-1 firing activity [see also Fig. 5(b)]. For D = 0.018, X(t) generates period-2 firing activity, i.e., there are two contiguous spikes in one period [see also Fig. 5(d)]. For D = 0.04, X(t) generates period-3 firing activity, i.e., there are three contiguous spikes in one period [see also Fig. 5(f)].
With the obtained results of this subsection, an interesting phenomenon—stochastic multiresonance—has been revealed in coupled FHN neuronal network. And, we also know that when period T_{e} of the subthreshold signal changes, the neuronal system could generate different stochastic multiresonances. For instance, the neuronal system can generate stochastic bi-resonance for T_{e} = 9 and stochastic tri-resonance for T_{e} = 14. In Subsection III B, we will try to give some explanations of the occurrence of observed stochastic multiresonance.
B. Phenomenon explanation of stochastic multiresonance
Based on the above obtained results, we conject that occurrence of the observed stochastic bi-resonance or tri-resonance maybe have close relationship with the noise-induced internal time scale of the neuronal network T_{0} and the period of subthreshold signal T_{e}. It has been revealed that noise could induce an excitable neuronal system to generate coherent firing activities in the absence of subthreshold signal, which is named as coherence resonance (CR) [60]. Here, we name the period of noise-induced coherent firing activities of the neuronal system as noise-induced internal time scale of the neuronal network, labeled as T_{0}. It can be found that T_{0} is mainly determined by system parameter a.
In the following, we take T_{e} = 14 as an example to check the conjecture. In order to have some deep understandings of noise-induced stochastic tri-resonance, we will try to make clear why X(t) could generate period-1, period-2, and period-3 firing activities at the three optimal noise intensities D=0.001,0.018, and 0.04. Therefore, histograms of ISIs for the mean field X(t) at these three optimal noise intensities are shown in Fig. 6.
As shown in Fig. 6(a), ISIs are concentrated at ISI ≈14 for D = 0.001. It indicated that noise could induce the neuronal network to generate nearly periodic firing activity. And, the period of this noise-induced firing activity is approximately consistent with the period of subthreshold signal T_{e}. Thus, Q could reach the first local maximum as presented in Fig. 4. The reason for period-1 firing activity induced by noise is similar as the one for the occurrence of classical stochastic resonance. While in Figs. 6(b) and 6(c), ISIs are both concentrated at two different values. Different from Fig. 6(b), the number of ISIs around the small value is nearly twice the number of ISIs around the large one. Moreover, if we add the small value to the large one of ISIs in Fig. 6(b) and add twice the small value to the large value of ISIs in Fig. 6(c), we can get that the two sums are both equivalent to the period of subthreshold signal T_{e} = 14. Combined with the results exhibited in Figs. 5(d) and 5(f), we can get that there are two or three spikes induced by noise within the period T_{e}. Thus, Q could reach the second and third local maximum at D = 0.018 and D = 0.04, as shown in Fig. 4. And in this paper, we call these two periodic firing activity, shown in Figs. 5(d) and 5(f), period-2 and period-3 firing activities, respectively.
It is well known that neurons are usually triggered to generate much more spikes when noise intensity D increases, which has also been verified by the results shown in Figs. 5 and 6. However, spikes cannot be induced indiscriminately by increasing noise intensity. If we analyze the results obtained in Figs. 5 and 6 carefully, we reveal that within the period T_{e} additional contiguous spikes appear not randomly but with a time lag being approximately equal to the noise-induced internal time scale T_{0}. T_{0} is approximately 3.8 for a = 1.1, see the Appendix for details. Thus, for D = 0.018 and D = 0.04, much more spikes could be induced by noise than the case for D = 0.001, but the interspike intervals between two successive spikes cannot be smaller than T_{0}. Therefore, when T_{e} = 14, period-2 and period-3 firing activities can be induced by noise.
Now an interesting question that may have popped into your mind is “whether period-4 firing activities can be further induced or whether the fourth time of stochastic resonance could induced by noise for T_{e} = 14?.” The answer is “No.” So why? We have mentioned that additional contiguous spikes appear with a time lag being approximately equal to T_{0}. If noise could induce the period-4 firing activity for T_{e} = 14, it will lead to an ISI being approximately equal to T_{e}−3×T_{0}≈2.4, which is smaller than T_{0}. It contradicts with our observation. Therefore, noise just could induce stochastic tri-resonance for T_{e} = 14.
According to these analysis, we can conclude that noise could induce stochastic resonance M (M is an positive integer) times when the period of subthreshold signal T_{e} falls into the interval (M×T_{0},(M+1)×T_{0}). In order to make the above conclusion more persuasive, let us review the case for T_{e} = 9. Based on this conclusion, we can infer that noise could induce stochastic bi-resonance for T_{e} = 9, which coincides with the manifestation of firing activities and variation of Q with respect to D, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3.
With the above explanations, it can be seen that stochastic multiresonance has close relationship with the period of subthreshold signal T_{e} and the noise-induce internal time scale T_{0}. As mentioned in the above contents, T_{0} is mainly determined by the system parameter a. Thus, in Subsections III C and III D, we will devote for studying the influence of T_{e} and a on noise-induced stochastic multiresonance.
C. Influence of subthreshold signal periods
In Subsection III A, we have known that noise could induce stochastic biresonance for T_{e} = 9 and stochastic triresonance for T_{e} = 14. It implies that the period of subthreshold signal T_{e} has great influence on the occurrence of stochastic multiresonance. Thus, in this subsection, we will discuss the influence of T_{e} on noise-induced SMR. As presented in Fig. 1, with the increasing of T_{e}, the amplitude threshold A_{th} is also varied. In this paper, we just consider subthreshold signal. Therefore, when T_{e} increases from 5 to 20, A is set as A_{th}−0.01 accordingly in order to guarantee the external signal being subthreshold.
With the explanation given in the former subsection, we can see that noise could induce stochastic resonance for M (M is an positive integer) times when M×3.8<T_{e}<(M+1)×3.8. As illustrated in Fig. 7, when T_{e} is small, the neuronal system exhibits classical stochastic resonance, at which there is one notable peak of Q with noise intensity D increasing. The inset graph of Fig. 7 shows an example of classical stochastic resonance for T_{e} = 6. When T_{e} increases but not larger than 11.4, then noise could induce stochastic biresonance, as indicated by two peaks in the variation curve of Q with respect to D, refer to the case that T_{e} = 9, as shown in Fig. 2. And when T_{e} increases further, but not larger than 15.2, then noise could induce stochastic triresonance, as indicated by three peaks in the variation curve of Q with respect to D, refer to the case that T_{e} = 14, as shown in Fig. 4. However, as exhibited in Fig. 7, stochastic multiresonance becomes unobvious if T_{e} is too large, refer to the case that T_{e} = 18 as shown in Fig. 7. If T_{e} is too large, the frequency of the subthreshold signal will be too low. Then, it will be more difficult to detect it. Therefore, stochastic resonance is not apparent for much larger T_{e}.
D. Influence of parameter a in FHN model
As shown in the former subsections, the intervals between two contiguous spikes in one signal period are approximately equal to the noise-induced internal time scale T_{0}. T_{0} has close relationship with the system parameter a, as shown in Fig. 8(a). In Fig. 8(a), dependence of T_{0} with respect to a is depicted at its corresponding optimal noise intensity D. From this figure, we can see that T_{0} increases with a. For example, T_{0} is nearly 4.8 for a = 1.17 as shown in Fig. 8(a).
Now, we choose two different values of a, a = 1.1 and a = 1.17, respectively, and fix subthreshold signal period and amplitude T_{e}=7.5 and A = 0.12. The dependence of Fourier coefficient Q on noise intensity D for a = 1.1 and a = 1.17 is depicted in Fig. 8(b). When a = 1.1, Q has two peaks with D increasing. While a = 1.17, there is only one maximum of Q. It indicates that noise could induce stochastic bi-resonance for a = 1.1 and classical stochastic resonance for a = 1.17, respectively.
With the explanations presented in Sec. III B, we can understand the obtained results shown in Fig. 8(b) very well. As shown in Fig. 8(a), noise-induced internal time scale T_{0} approximates 3.8 and 4.8 for a = 1.1 and a = 1.17, respectively. Because T_{e}=7.5 falls into the interval between 2×3.8 and (2+1)×3.8, stochastic bi-resonance could be induced by noise when a = 1.1. While T_{e}=7.5 falls into the interval between 1×4.8 and (1+1)×4.8, so neuronal network just exhibits classical stochastic resonance when a = 1.17.
IV. DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSION
Up to now, noise-induced stochastic multiresonance is discussed in a small-world neuronal network. In fact, this result can also be generalize into regular network, random network, and small-world networks with different rewiring probabilities p and k. With the same parameters taken in Fig. 2, stochastic bi-resonance still occurs with different values of k and rewiring probability p, as shown in Fig. 9. It indicates that noise induced stochastic bi-resonance is robust to the parameters of k and p when the network is set as a small-world network. To check whether noise could also induce stochastic multiresonance in other kinds of networks, the dependence of Q with respect to D for regular and random network is considered. Here, the regular network is constructed by connecting each neuron to its 20 nearest neighbors and the random network is gotten by connecting each pair of neurons with probability 0.1. And both networks contain N = 200 neurons. As shown in Fig. 10, noise-induced stochastic bi-resonance is also robust to network topology.
In the whole paper, we focus on the stochastic multiresonance in neuronal networks, while whether a single neuron system can generate stochastic multiresonance is to be demonstrated. Figure 11(a) illustrates that a single neuron can only generate one resonance to the external signal, namely, classical stochastic resonance. At the peak, time series of the neuron is shown in Fig. 11(b). The neuron fires regularly by the signal period T_{e} = 9, which is period-1 firing. While D is larger than the peak, the number of triggered spikes is more than that of period-1 firing. But the time series is always not regular, rather than the regular period-2 firing in small-world network. In Fig. 11(c), it is shown as one case of the irregular firings. So, we can draw a conclusion that network effect is necessary to generate multiresonance.
To sum up, we numerically revealed that noise could induce stochastic multiresonance in Watts-Strogatz small world neuronal networks. If we denote the noise-induced internal time scale of firing activity of the neuronal network as T_{0}, we find that the occurrence of stochastic multiresonance has close relationship with T_{0} and the period of subthreshold signal T_{e}. As presented in this paper, when the period of subthreshold signal T_{e} is not very large, then the neuronal network could generate stochastic resonance for M (M=1,2,3,…) times with T_{e} falling into the interval M×T_{0}<T_{e}<(M+1)×T_{0}. Because system parameter a determines the noise-induced internal time scale T_{0}, it is revealed that both the period T_{e} of subthreshold signal and the system parameter a have great influence on noise-induced stochastic multiresonance.
Generally, stochastic resonance is used for detecting weak external signal. Our results show that there exist several optimal values of noise intensity at which the mean field of membrane potential of the neuronal network has high correlation with the subthreshold signal. That is to say, it is possible to detect an external subthreshold signal at different values of noise intensity but not only at one particular value as reported in the former works. Detection of subthreshold signal is very meaningful in realistic neuronal systems; therefore, the obtained results in this paper could give some important implications on the topic in neuroscience—how to detect the subthreshold signal in the cortex.
In sensory neuronal networks, signal detection is significant as it facilitates subsequent information propagation and information coding. And physiological experiments have reported that the detection of weak signal occurs when stochastic resonance (SR) phenomenon is strengthen by the optimal noise stimulation. This provides the experimental evidences for theoretical research. In this paper, we study stochastic resonance in neuronal networks from the perspective of numerical simulation. The local dynamics of the neuronal network is described by FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) neuronal model and the network structure is set to be a small-world neuronal network. Here, we adopt Fourier coefficient of the mean field of the membrane potential in the system to measure the strength of stochastic resonance. The main results show that noise could induce the system to generate stochastic multiresonance (SMR). Namely, there exist more than one values of noise intensity at which the subthreshold signal can be detected efficiently.
Noise exists everywhere in nonlinear dynamical systems and is always considered to be destructive. However, in the past, it is found that noise could also play constructive roles [1,2]. One of the most famous examples is the stochastic resonance (SR) phenomenon [3,4]. SR phenomenon manifests that feeble input information (such as a weak signal) can be amplified by optimal intensity of additive noise. In other words, weak signal can be detected with the aid of some appropriate noise level. Due to its potential applications in different fields [5], stochastic resonance has attracted continuous attention both theoretically [6–8] and experimentally [9–11] over the past decades. Theoretical research of SR starts from discrete two-state model [12] to continuous bistable systems [13–15]. Afterwards, experimental studies on SR are more widespread in optical systems [16], electronic and magnetic systems [17,18], and neural systems.
Especially in neuronal systems, neuronal firing dynamics has a characteristic of bistability, so that SR phenomenon could be induced by noise and has been widely investigated [19–21]. Many physiological experiments have been shown that the ability of sensory neurons to process weak input signals can be significantly enhanced by adding noise to the system [22–25]. In addition, mathematical models have been also established to study the effect of time-delay or hybrid synapse on SR [26–29]. Furthermore, SR phenomenon can be used for understanding the weak signal detection and information propagation [30–32].
Moreover, Vilar and Rubí astonishingly revealed that response of a single element model stimulated by subthreshold periodic signals may be enhanced at multiple values of the noise level [33]. They referred this phenomenon as stochastic multiresonance (SMR). After that, SMR has been reported in several models and systems, for example, Landau-Lifschitz equation [34], system with hopping energy levels [35], single-mode laser model [36–38], hepatocyte model [39], bistable system [40,41], etc. Moreover, dynamical features of nonlinear system are also found to have great influences on the occurrence of SMR. For example, it is found that the hepatocyte model can generate an extra resonance peak in the relative smaller noise intensity and exhibit stochastic biresonance (SBR) when the dynamical parameters are extremely closed to the Hopf-bifurcation point [39]. Besides single element model, SMR has also be found in networks, such as one dimension chain [42,43], scale-free network coupling with Ising models [44], and hierarchical network consisting of threshold elements [45].
Remarkably, the system manifesting SMR has better capacity for detecting and propagating signals [46,47], since there exists several optimal noise intensities at which the subthreshold signal can be detected efficiently. Therefore, more and more researchers are inspired to study SMR [48–55]. However, stochastic multiresonance in excitable neuronal networks is still not deeply studied [56]. In this paper, we devote for studying stochastic multiresonance in a small-world neuronal network, which is locally modelled by FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) neuronal model. And besides additive noise, each single neuron is also stimulated by a weak sinusoid weak signal. We will reveal that this neuronal network could exhibit stochastic bi-resonance or stochastic tri-resonance (STR) with regard to different values of the period of subthreshold signal. And with further analysis, we show that the occurrence of SMR is affected by two factors—the period of subthreshold signal T_{e} and the system parameter a.
Finally, the organizational structure of this paper is given as follows: In Sec. II, each neuron of the small-world neuronal network is stimulated by a subthreshold signal and an additive independent noise. Meanwhile, Fourier coefficient of the mean field of membrane potential in the neuronal system is introduced to quantify the correlation between the system response and the subthreshold signal. In Sec. III, effects of noise on the neuronal network are studied in detail. The obtained results will show that noise could induce the studied neuronal network to generate stochastic bi-resonance or tri-resonance. That is to say, in this section, we will see that noise could induce stochastic multiresonance. Moreover, some explanations are presented to try to make the occurrence of noise-induced SMR be understood much easily. Finally, a brief discussion and conclusion are drawn in Sec. IV.
The FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model [57,58] is used to describe the local single neuron, and equations of the neuronal network are presented as follows:
where x_{i} represents the action potential and is fast variable of the i–th neuron, and y_{i} represents the slow recovery variable, i=1,2,…,N. N is the total number of neurons contained in the network. The fast and slow variables are separated by the small parameter ε, which is set as 0.01. Depending on the system parameter a, each individual neuron exhibits either oscillatory (|a|<1.0) or excitable (|a|>1.0) behavior. In this work, we fix that all units are in excitable regime with a = 1.1 without special demonstration. Thus, each neuron in the neuronal network is in a resting state, unless there are some external stimuli. One of the stimuli is channel noise that is caused by the random flow of ions passing through ion channels and the random open/close of ion channels. In neuronal model, channel noise ξ_{i}(t) is usually introduced into slow variables and is set to be Gaussian noise with ⟨ξ_{i}(t)⟩=0 and ⟨ξ_{i}(t)ξ_{j}(t′)⟩=δ_{ij}δ(t−t′). D is the noise intensity. Asin(2πT_{e}t) is a subthreshold signal with period T_{e}. In other words, without noise ξ_{i}(t), signal Asin(2πT_{e}t) is not capable of triggering neurons to generate any spikes. The threshold of amplitude A_{th} for different period T_{e} is shown in Fig. 1. As shown in Fig. 1, Asin(2πT_{e}t) is a subthreshold signal when (T_{e},A) is located in the gray area. For example, when the signal period T_{e} = 9, the amplitude A can be set as 0.13 to make Asin(2πT_{e}t) be a subthreshold signal.
In this paper, the neuronal network is considered as a small-world network with N = 200 neurons. To obtain a small-world neuronal network, we follow the random rewiring procedure proposed by Watts and Strogatz [59]. Starting from a ringlike network with regular connectivity, where each unit is connected to its k = 20 nearest neighbors, we rewire each edge randomly with the probability p. By increasing the probability p, the architecture of network is tuned between two extremes: regular (p = 0) and random (p = 1) networks. For 0<p<1, the resulting networks show small-world property. In the following, the rewiring probability is set as p = 0.15 without specified. J=(J_{ij}) is a connection matrix: J_{ij}=J_{ji}=1 if neuron i is connected to neuron j, J_{ij} = 0 otherwise, and J_{ii} = 0. And the coupling strength g is set as 0.015 throughout the paper.
In the followings, stochastic Euler algorithm is applied to numerically solve equations of the neuronal network with a fixed time step of 0.001. Meanwhile, the initial values are set as x_{i}(0)=0,y_{i}(0)=0.
To quantitatively characterize stochastic resonance phenomenon, we calculate the Fourier coefficient Q. It reflects the correlation of temporal output series of X(t) with subthreshold signal Asin(2πT_{e}t), which is defined as
where [0,T] is the integral interval. And X(t)=1N∑i=1Nx_{i}(t) is the mean field of membrane potential of neurons inside the network. Large Q indicates both resonance of the entire neuronal network and the strong capability of detecting signal. In most of the instances, the system's response to subthreshold signal exhibits SR phenomenon, which was sufficiently discussed in Ref [3]. In this paper, the classical stochastic resonance (SR) phenomenon happens if the Fourier coefficient Q has a local maximum with increasing of noise intensity D, seeing the inset of Fig. 7 for a reference. And if the Fourier coefficient Q has several local maxima with increasing of noise intensity D, then it indicates the occurrence of SMR. In Secs. III A–III D, to calculate Q, the time span T for recording membrane potentials x_{i}(t)(i=1,…,N) is set as 500. And the final results (except the figure of time series of one arbitrary neuron) are obtained by averaging over 10 independent runs to warrant appropriate statistical accuracy with respect to the small-world network generation and numerical stimulation of the Gaussian noise.
In addition, inter-spike interval (ISI), which can describe the important feature of time series X(t), is depicted by the time interval between two contiguous firings. Suppose the k−th firing moment of the i−th neuron is denoted by t_{i}(k) when membrane voltage x_{i}(t) increases from negative to positive, then ISIs of the i−th neuron can be calculated by ΔT_{i}(k)=t_{i}(k+1)−t_{i}(k) with k≥1 being an integer. In the following of the paper, distribution of ISIs is adopted to explain the occurrence of SMR.
In this section, we will exhibit the results of stochastic multiresonance (SMR) phenomenon in coupled excitable FHN systems. At first, stochastic multiresonance is discovered by calculating the Fourier coefficient Q with respect to noise intensity D. And in order to show detailed information of noise-induced stochastic multiresonance, time series of mean field X(t) is also depicted for some values of D. Then, we try to give some explanations of the noise-induced SMR through analyzing inter-spike intervals (ISIs) of the neuronal networks. Afterwards, we investigate the effects of period T_{e} of the subthreshold signal and system parameter a on this phenomenon in Subsections III C and III D.
In this subsection, for the purpose of discovering noise-induced stochastic multiresonance, we will focus on investigating effects of noise intensity D on the Fourier coefficient Q under the subthreshold signal Asin(2πT_{e}t) for two values of period T_{e}. One is T_{e} = 9, and the other is T_{e} = 14. In the following, we will show that noise could induce stochastic bi-resonance when T_{e} = 9 and tri-resonance when T_{e} = 14, respectively.
Dependence of Q with respect to D is calculated for T_{e} = 9 at first, as shown in Fig. 2. Here, as depicted in Fig. 1, the amplitude A is set as 0.13 for T_{e} = 9 in order to ensure the signal being subthreshold (the threshold is 0.136). From Fig. 2, we can see that with increasing D, there exist two optimal values of noise intensity D at which the Fourier coefficient Q reaches to local maximum, one is at relatively small noise intensity D = 0.005 and the other is at relatively large noise intensity D = 0.04. That means, the neuronal system exhibits stochastic bi-resonance. At these two values of noise intensity D, correlation between the mean field X(t) and the subthreshold signal Asin(2πT_{e}t) becomes stronger, and detecting the weak signal by the neuronal network is more efficient. Moreover, as exhibited in Fig. 2, a wider range of noise intensity D around D = 0.04 is available for detecting the external subthreshold signal.
Furthermore, corresponding to Fig. 2, the mean field X(t) for five different values of D is depicted to illustrate noise-induced bi-resonance much more clearly, as shown in Fig. 3. When D = 0, there is no noise in the system. Because all neurons are excitable and the external signal is subthreshold, all neurons could not generate any spikes. Thus, X(t) just oscillates around resting potential slightly, as exhibited in Fig. 3(a). When D increases to D = 0.005, around which Q reaches to the first local maximum, mean field X(t) generates periodic firing activities, as presented in Fig. 3(b). Here, the period of X(t) is nearly equal to the period of subthreshold signal T_{e} = 9. Namely, under the noise intensity around 0.005, mean field X(t) has strong correlation with the subthreshold signal. Therefore, Q reaches local maximum and the subthreshold signal can be detected effectively. Then, noise intensity D is increased further to 0.02, and X(t) becomes irregular [see also Fig. 3(c)], which results in the weak correlation between X(t) and the external subthreshold signal. However, once we increase D further to nearly 0.04, a surprising phenomenon appears—Q reaches another local maximum. With time series of X(t) at D = 0.04 exhibited in Fig. 3(d), it can be seen that X(t) becomes periodic again. And the period of X(t) is again approximately equal to the period of subthreshold signal T_{e}. Then, the subthreshold signal can also be detected effectively at this noise intensity. However, different from Fig. 3(b), there are two contiguous spikes in one period instead of one. In this paper, we call it as period-2 firing activity. Mean field of the system is totally turbulent when D increases to much large values, as shown in Fig. 3(e). It means that the system fails to detect subthreshold signal with large enough noise intensity.
Next, dependence of Q with respect to D is presented for T_{e} = 14, as shown in Fig. 4. Here, in order to ensure that the external signal being subthreshold, the amplitude A is set as 0.14 for T_{e} = 14 (the threshold is 0.144 for T_{e} = 14, as depicted in Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 4, Q could reach three local maxima with the increasing of D. It indicated that noise could induce the considered neuronal system to generate stochastic resonance three times, which is called as stochastic tri-resonance. And the three optimal values of D, which correspond to the three local maxima of Q, are approximately 0.001, 0.018, and 0.04, respectively. Similar as the case for T_{e} = 9, around D = 0.04, Q could stay at large values in a wide range of noise intensity D.
Corresponding to Fig. 4, time series of the mean field X(t) for seven different values of D are exhibited in Fig. 5. In Fig. 5(a), X(t) just oscillates slightly around resting potential when D = 0. When D increases a little to 0.001, X(t) generates periodic activities. And the period of X(t) is nearly equal to T_{e} = 14, as shown in Fig. 5(b). It indicates that the subthreshold signal can be detected effectively under this noisy condition. With increasing D further to D = 0.004, X(t) becomes irregular, i.e., correlation between X(t) and the subthreshold signal Asin(2πT_{e}t) becomes weak. Thus, detecting subthreshold signal becomes difficult. Moreover, when D increases to 0.018, X(t) generates periodic behavior again, as exhibited in Fig. 5(d). And the period of X(t) is also approximately T_{e}. In this case, the subthreshold signal can be detected successfully. However, when D increases again to 0.024, then X(t) fails to generate periodic activities, which results in the failure of detecting subthreshold signal. And then the correlation between X(t) and the subthreshold signal becomes weak again. And with increasing of D again to 0.04, X(t) can also generate periodic activities, as presented in Fig. 5(f). The period of this activity is also nearly T_{e}. And for very large D, e.g., D = 0.1, noise plays a dominant role and X(t) becomes disordered, as shown in Fig. 5(g). Therefore, as noise intensity D increases from zero, the neuronal system could successfully detect the subthreshold signal three times, which results in three local maxima of Q. And similar as the results presented in Fig. 3, the periodic activities of X(t) corresponding to these three local maxima of Q are different from each other. For D = 0.001, X(t) generates period-1 firing activity [see also Fig. 5(b)]. For D = 0.018, X(t) generates period-2 firing activity, i.e., there are two contiguous spikes in one period [see also Fig. 5(d)]. For D = 0.04, X(t) generates period-3 firing activity, i.e., there are three contiguous spikes in one period [see also Fig. 5(f)].
With the obtained results of this subsection, an interesting phenomenon—stochastic multiresonance—has been revealed in coupled FHN neuronal network. And, we also know that when period T_{e} of the subthreshold signal changes, the neuronal system could generate different stochastic multiresonances. For instance, the neuronal system can generate stochastic bi-resonance for T_{e} = 9 and stochastic tri-resonance for T_{e} = 14. In Subsection III B, we will try to give some explanations of the occurrence of observed stochastic multiresonance.
Based on the above obtained results, we conject that occurrence of the observed stochastic bi-resonance or tri-resonance maybe have close relationship with the noise-induced internal time scale of the neuronal network T_{0} and the period of subthreshold signal T_{e}. It has been revealed that noise could induce an excitable neuronal system to generate coherent firing activities in the absence of subthreshold signal, which is named as coherence resonance (CR) [60]. Here, we name the period of noise-induced coherent firing activities of the neuronal system as noise-induced internal time scale of the neuronal network, labeled as T_{0}. It can be found that T_{0} is mainly determined by system parameter a.
In the following, we take T_{e} = 14 as an example to check the conjecture. In order to have some deep understandings of noise-induced stochastic tri-resonance, we will try to make clear why X(t) could generate period-1, period-2, and period-3 firing activities at the three optimal noise intensities D=0.001,0.018, and 0.04. Therefore, histograms of ISIs for the mean field X(t) at these three optimal noise intensities are shown in Fig. 6.
As shown in Fig. 6(a), ISIs are concentrated at ISI ≈14 for D = 0.001. It indicated that noise could induce the neuronal network to generate nearly periodic firing activity. And, the period of this noise-induced firing activity is approximately consistent with the period of subthreshold signal T_{e}. Thus, Q could reach the first local maximum as presented in Fig. 4. The reason for period-1 firing activity induced by noise is similar as the one for the occurrence of classical stochastic resonance. While in Figs. 6(b) and 6(c), ISIs are both concentrated at two different values. Different from Fig. 6(b), the number of ISIs around the small value is nearly twice the number of ISIs around the large one. Moreover, if we add the small value to the large one of ISIs in Fig. 6(b) and add twice the small value to the large value of ISIs in Fig. 6(c), we can get that the two sums are both equivalent to the period of subthreshold signal T_{e} = 14. Combined with the results exhibited in Figs. 5(d) and 5(f), we can get that there are two or three spikes induced by noise within the period T_{e}. Thus, Q could reach the second and third local maximum at D = 0.018 and D = 0.04, as shown in Fig. 4. And in this paper, we call these two periodic firing activity, shown in Figs. 5(d) and 5(f), period-2 and period-3 firing activities, respectively.
It is well known that neurons are usually triggered to generate much more spikes when noise intensity D increases, which has also been verified by the results shown in Figs. 5 and 6. However, spikes cannot be induced indiscriminately by increasing noise intensity. If we analyze the results obtained in Figs. 5 and 6 carefully, we reveal that within the period T_{e} additional contiguous spikes appear not randomly but with a time lag being approximately equal to the noise-induced internal time scale T_{0}. T_{0} is approximately 3.8 for a = 1.1, see the Appendix for details. Thus, for D = 0.018 and D = 0.04, much more spikes could be induced by noise than the case for D = 0.001, but the interspike intervals between two successive spikes cannot be smaller than T_{0}. Therefore, when T_{e} = 14, period-2 and period-3 firing activities can be induced by noise.
Now an interesting question that may have popped into your mind is “whether period-4 firing activities can be further induced or whether the fourth time of stochastic resonance could induced by noise for T_{e} = 14?.” The answer is “No.” So why? We have mentioned that additional contiguous spikes appear with a time lag being approximately equal to T_{0}. If noise could induce the period-4 firing activity for T_{e} = 14, it will lead to an ISI being approximately equal to T_{e}−3×T_{0}≈2.4, which is smaller than T_{0}. It contradicts with our observation. Therefore, noise just could induce stochastic tri-resonance for T_{e} = 14.
According to these analysis, we can conclude that noise could induce stochastic resonance M (M is an positive integer) times when the period of subthreshold signal T_{e} falls into the interval (M×T_{0},(M+1)×T_{0}). In order to make the above conclusion more persuasive, let us review the case for T_{e} = 9. Based on this conclusion, we can infer that noise could induce stochastic bi-resonance for T_{e} = 9, which coincides with the manifestation of firing activities and variation of Q with respect to D, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3.
With the above explanations, it can be seen that stochastic multiresonance has close relationship with the period of subthreshold signal T_{e} and the noise-induce internal time scale T_{0}. As mentioned in the above contents, T_{0} is mainly determined by the system parameter a. Thus, in Subsections III C and III D, we will devote for studying the influence of T_{e} and a on noise-induced stochastic multiresonance.
In Subsection III A, we have known that noise could induce stochastic biresonance for T_{e} = 9 and stochastic triresonance for T_{e} = 14. It implies that the period of subthreshold signal T_{e} has great influence on the occurrence of stochastic multiresonance. Thus, in this subsection, we will discuss the influence of T_{e} on noise-induced SMR. As presented in Fig. 1, with the increasing of T_{e}, the amplitude threshold A_{th} is also varied. In this paper, we just consider subthreshold signal. Therefore, when T_{e} increases from 5 to 20, A is set as A_{th}−0.01 accordingly in order to guarantee the external signal being subthreshold.
With the explanation given in the former subsection, we can see that noise could induce stochastic resonance for M (M is an positive integer) times when M×3.8<T_{e}<(M+1)×3.8. As illustrated in Fig. 7, when T_{e} is small, the neuronal system exhibits classical stochastic resonance, at which there is one notable peak of Q with noise intensity D increasing. The inset graph of Fig. 7 shows an example of classical stochastic resonance for T_{e} = 6. When T_{e} increases but not larger than 11.4, then noise could induce stochastic biresonance, as indicated by two peaks in the variation curve of Q with respect to D, refer to the case that T_{e} = 9, as shown in Fig. 2. And when T_{e} increases further, but not larger than 15.2, then noise could induce stochastic triresonance, as indicated by three peaks in the variation curve of Q with respect to D, refer to the case that T_{e} = 14, as shown in Fig. 4. However, as exhibited in Fig. 7, stochastic multiresonance becomes unobvious if T_{e} is too large, refer to the case that T_{e} = 18 as shown in Fig. 7. If T_{e} is too large, the frequency of the subthreshold signal will be too low. Then, it will be more difficult to detect it. Therefore, stochastic resonance is not apparent for much larger T_{e}.
As shown in the former subsections, the intervals between two contiguous spikes in one signal period are approximately equal to the noise-induced internal time scale T_{0}. T_{0} has close relationship with the system parameter a, as shown in Fig. 8(a). In Fig. 8(a), dependence of T_{0} with respect to a is depicted at its corresponding optimal noise intensity D. From this figure, we can see that T_{0} increases with a. For example, T_{0} is nearly 4.8 for a = 1.17 as shown in Fig. 8(a).
Now, we choose two different values of a, a = 1.1 and a = 1.17, respectively, and fix subthreshold signal period and amplitude T_{e}=7.5 and A = 0.12. The dependence of Fourier coefficient Q on noise intensity D for a = 1.1 and a = 1.17 is depicted in Fig. 8(b). When a = 1.1, Q has two peaks with D increasing. While a = 1.17, there is only one maximum of Q. It indicates that noise could induce stochastic bi-resonance for a = 1.1 and classical stochastic resonance for a = 1.17, respectively.
With the explanations presented in Sec. III B, we can understand the obtained results shown in Fig. 8(b) very well. As shown in Fig. 8(a), noise-induced internal time scale T_{0} approximates 3.8 and 4.8 for a = 1.1 and a = 1.17, respectively. Because T_{e}=7.5 falls into the interval between 2×3.8 and (2+1)×3.8, stochastic bi-resonance could be induced by noise when a = 1.1. While T_{e}=7.5 falls into the interval between 1×4.8 and (1+1)×4.8, so neuronal network just exhibits classical stochastic resonance when a = 1.17.
Up to now, noise-induced stochastic multiresonance is discussed in a small-world neuronal network. In fact, this result can also be generalize into regular network, random network, and small-world networks with different rewiring probabilities p and k. With the same parameters taken in Fig. 2, stochastic bi-resonance still occurs with different values of k and rewiring probability p, as shown in Fig. 9. It indicates that noise induced stochastic bi-resonance is robust to the parameters of k and p when the network is set as a small-world network. To check whether noise could also induce stochastic multiresonance in other kinds of networks, the dependence of Q with respect to D for regular and random network is considered. Here, the regular network is constructed by connecting each neuron to its 20 nearest neighbors and the random network is gotten by connecting each pair of neurons with probability 0.1. And both networks contain N = 200 neurons. As shown in Fig. 10, noise-induced stochastic bi-resonance is also robust to network topology.
In the whole paper, we focus on the stochastic multiresonance in neuronal networks, while whether a single neuron system can generate stochastic multiresonance is to be demonstrated. Figure 11(a) illustrates that a single neuron can only generate one resonance to the external signal, namely, classical stochastic resonance. At the peak, time series of the neuron is shown in Fig. 11(b). The neuron fires regularly by the signal period T_{e} = 9, which is period-1 firing. While D is larger than the peak, the number of triggered spikes is more than that of period-1 firing. But the time series is always not regular, rather than the regular period-2 firing in small-world network. In Fig. 11(c), it is shown as one case of the irregular firings. So, we can draw a conclusion that network effect is necessary to generate multiresonance.
To sum up, we numerically revealed that noise could induce stochastic multiresonance in Watts-Strogatz small world neuronal networks. If we denote the noise-induced internal time scale of firing activity of the neuronal network as T_{0}, we find that the occurrence of stochastic multiresonance has close relationship with T_{0} and the period of subthreshold signal T_{e}. As presented in this paper, when the period of subthreshold signal T_{e} is not very large, then the neuronal network could generate stochastic resonance for M (M=1,2,3,…) times with T_{e} falling into the interval M×T_{0}<T_{e}<(M+1)×T_{0}. Because system parameter a determines the noise-induced internal time scale T_{0}, it is revealed that both the period T_{e} of subthreshold signal and the system parameter a have great influence on noise-induced stochastic multiresonance.
Generally, stochastic resonance is used for detecting weak external signal. Our results show that there exist several optimal values of noise intensity at which the mean field of membrane potential of the neuronal network has high correlation with the subthreshold signal. That is to say, it is possible to detect an external subthreshold signal at different values of noise intensity but not only at one particular value as reported in the former works. Detection of subthreshold signal is very meaningful in realistic neuronal systems; therefore, the obtained results in this paper could give some important implications on the topic in neuroscience—how to detect the subthreshold signal in the cortex.
APPENDIX: NOISE-INDUCED INTERNAL TIME SCALE T_{0} OF THE NEURONAL NETWORK
If the neuronal network is not affected by the external subthreshold signal, noise could induce neuronal network to generate a coherent firing activity. This phenomenon is called as coherence resonance (CR). Here, a coherent measure is introduced and defined as
Here, λ_{i} is the reciprocal of the coefficient of variation and is formulated as
where ⟨ΔT_{i}(k)⟩ and ⟨ΔT_{i}(k){2}⟩ denote the mean and the mean squared ISIs, respectively. λ_{i} can quantify the regularity of spike timing in a neuron. Larger λ_{i} indicates regular ISIs of the neuron. Thus, larger λ indicates higher spiking regularity of the entire neuronal network.
Here, system parameter a is taken as 1.1. As Fig. 12(a) shown, λ has an optimal value with increasing of the noise intensity D, which indicates the appearance of CR. The optimal value of D is around 0.04. Time series of X(t) at D = 0.04 is given in Fig. 12(b). As shown in Fig. 12(b), the mean field X(t) is regular and nearly periodic. And histogram of ISIs of all neurons inside the neuronal network within a fixed time interval at D = 0.04 is presented in Fig. 12(c). As depicted in Fig. 12(c), ISIs are distributed in a small range and the central value is around 3.8. Here, we call the central values of ISIs as noise-induced internal time scale and denote it as T_{0} in this paper. Then, with the presented parameters, noise-induced internal time scale T_{0}≈3.8.
