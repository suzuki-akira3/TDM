Hydrodynamic relaxations in dissipative particle dynamics
This paper studies the dynamics of relaxation phenomena in the standard dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) model [R. D. Groot and P. B. Warren, J. Chem. Phys. 107, 4423 (1997)]. Using fluctuating hydrodynamics as the framework of the investigation, we focus on the collective transverse and longitudinal dynamics. It is shown that classical hydrodynamic theory predicts the transverse dynamics at relatively low temperatures very well when compared to simulation data; however, the theory predictions are, on the same length scale, less accurate for higher temperatures. The agreement with hydrodynamics depends on the definition of the viscosity, and here we find that the transverse dynamics are independent of the dissipative and random shear force contributions to the stress. For high temperatures, the spectrum for the longitudinal dynamics is dominated by the Brillouin peak for large length scales and the relaxation is therefore governed by sound wave propagation and is athermal. This contrasts the results at lower temperatures and small length scale, where the thermal process is clearly present in the spectra. The DPD model, at least qualitatively, re-captures the underlying hydrodynamical mechanisms, and quantitative agreement is excellent at intermediate temperatures for the transverse dynamics.
I. INTRODUCTION
The dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) method [1,2] is widely used to perform mesoscale computer simulations of, e.g., polymer solutions [3], spinodal decomposition [4], fluid flows in micro- and nanopores [5,6], and cell membrane damage [7], just to name a few examples. A standard DPD simulation involves a set of point particles interacting by three different forces: A conservative force, a dissipative force, and a random force in such a manner that momentum is conserved. The DPD particle can be thought of as a collection of molecules moving in a coherent fashion [8]. The forces are often tweaked to mimic specific fluidic systems, e.g., the particles can be connected with spring forces to simulate polymer solutions and melts; see also the review by Moeendarbary et_al [9] Importantly, the interparticle conservative force is weak and usually without a strong repulsive core; in fact, the conservative force is not necessary in order to obtain hydrodynamic behavior [10,11].
In the DPD model by Groot and Warren [12], the conservative force is linear with respect to the distance between the two point masses. This model is simple and very appealing; however, it yields an unrealistic equation of state which is quadratic in density [12]. Also, the dissipative force depends only on the position and velocity differences of the two interacting particles and neglects shear forces [13]. Nevertheless, the parameter space for this model is quite large and the physical interpretation of the parameters is not always straightforward. For example, the particle density can be chosen as a free parameter for a given system, and from this choice, the conservative force parameter can be estimated using the compressibility [12]. Interestingly, this so-called adaptive parameter approach leads to a decreasing viscosity for decreasing temperature [5], which characterizes a gas [14]. This gaseous behavior is also manifested by a Schmidt number of order unity [12], where the Schmidt number is defined as the ratio between the kinematic viscosity and the diffusion coefficient. Bocquet and Charlaix [15] conjectured that classical hydrodynamics is valid for wavevectors k fulfilling k<k_{max}=2πρ/η_{0}τ_{s}, where ρ is the density, η_{0} is the shear viscosity, and τ_{s} is the relaxation time given by the shear stress relaxation [16]. From this criterion, one can argue that in the low density limit (low Schmidt number), the classical hydrodynamic theory will break down even at large length scales as the viscosity and relaxation time are only functions of temperature in this limit, and one has k_{max}∝ρ→0asρ→0. Note that Jiang et_al [17] found that DPD polymer model systems perform hydrodynamically at Schmidt numbers in the order of unity. Also, Peters [18] argues that the Schmidt number is ill defined for coarse grained models, where the molecular self-diffusion coefficient is not readily found.
The hydrodynamic properties for the DPD technique have been thoroughly investigated in the past, see, for example, Refs [10] and  [11]. However, as the DPD model is widely used by the simulation community [5,19–21] at low Schmidt number, we believe it is important to investigate the properties of the model by Groot and Warren under conditions where the Schmidt number varies from unity to higher values typically characterizing liquids like the model Lennard-Jones liquid used in classical molecular dynamics.
It has been noted by several authors [10,22] that the energy is not conserved in the standard DPD model, and that it cannot be applied to study systems characterized by a sustained temperature gradient on the macroscopic time scales. However, the model does feature fast energy relaxations and, as also concluded by Marsh et_al [10], it can indeed be applied to investigate these relaxations. We wish to include this here as it will provide a valuable insight into the underlying mechanisms of the DPD method in general.
We base our investigation on Onsager’s regression hypothesis, which states that the regression of microscopically induced fluctuations in equilibrium follows the macroscopic laws of small non-equilibrium disturbances [23], i.e., thermally induced perturbations relax according to hydrodynamics. Typically, these (fast) relaxations do not refer to hydrodynamic quantities like density and momentum directly, but instead to the decay of the associated correlation functions [24], as predicted by the hydrodynamic theory. We derive these correlation functions from basic fluctuating hydrodynamics theory as this may not be known to the reader; also, we present it in a slightly different form (albeit equivalent) from that of standard texts [25–27]. To make the study manageable, we focus on a limited part of the parameter space of the standard DPD model.
II. THE HYDRODYNAMIC RELAXATION FUNCTIONS
In general, one can write the balance equation for any hydrodynamic quantity per unit mass ϕ=ϕr,t at position r and time t as [28]
where u is the streaming velocity, σ^{ϕ} is the production term, and J^{ϕ} is the flux of ϕ. In the case σ^{ϕ} = 0, the quantity is locally conserved. The hydrodynamic quantities we study here are the mass density, ρ = ρ(r, t), the streaming velocity, u = u(r, t), and the excess kinetic energy per unit mass, e = e(r, t); the latter quantity is defined as the difference between the local and average kinetic energies per unit mass, me(r,t)=E_{kin}(r,t)−32k_{B}T, where m is the particle mass. Based on the microscopic hydrodynamic operator formalism [16], one can derive the following balance equations in the form of Eq. (1) in the absence of any external driving forces:
where J^{m} is the mass flux tensor due to density gradients, P is the pressure tensor, and J^{e} is the excess kinetic energy flux tensor. Importantly, the excess kinetic energy per unit mass, e(r, t), is not a conserved quantity; hence, a production term σ^{e} appears in Eq. (2c). Furthermore, for the mass balance equation, Eq. (2a), we have decomposed the mass flux into two parts: one due to thermal motion, J^{m}, and one due to the fluid advective motion, ρu.
The three quantities can be written as the sum of the constant average part and the fluctuating part, i.e., ρ = ρ_{av} + δρ, u = δu = (δu_{x}, δu_{y}, δu_{z}), and e = δe since the averages of the streaming velocity and excess kinetic energy are zero. To first order in the fluctuations, we have
Using the framework of fluctuating hydrodynamics [29], we now introduce the linear constitutive relations with stochastic forcing
where D is the mass flux diffusivity coefficient, p is the normal pressure, η_{v} and η_{0} are the bulk and shear viscosities, λ is the heat conductivity, c_{V} is the specific heat per unit mass at constant volume, and (∇u)os is the trace-less symmetric part of the strain rate tensor.
Equations (4b) and (4c) are just the constitutive relation for a Newtonian fluid and Fourier’s law of conduction [14] with added stochastic forcing. However, as we cannot in general ignore the cross-correlations effects on small time and length scale, it is noted that D is not the self-diffusion coefficient [30]. Since the mass density and excess kinetic energy are scalars, that is of the same parity, both fluxes in Eqs. (4a) and (4c) can depend on the gradients of ρ and e according to Courier’s principle [28]. Here we follow Alley and Alder [25] and model the cross coupling through the production term σ_{e} and the pressure p_{eq}.
In equilibrium, the stochastic forcing term has a zero average [29] and is uncorrelated with the hydrodynamic quantities, e.g., ⟨δJ^{m}(r, t)δu(r′, t′)⟩ = 0. Substituting Eqs. (3) and (4) into Eq. (2), we arrive at the stochastic dynamics. To first order in the fluctuations, this is
since the advective terms are of second order. More advanced stochastic descriptions have been developed in order to, for example, include elastic properties of the fluid [31,32]. For local thermodynamic equilibrium, the pressure fluctuations can be written as [26]
where χ_{T}=−1/V∂V/∂p{T} is the isothermal compressibility, β_{V}=∂p/∂T{ρ} is the thermal pressure coefficient, and δe = c_{V}δT. The DPD method both adds and removes energy in a stochastic uncorrelated manner to and from the system. In this classical treatment, we assume the characteristic time scales associated with these stochastic processes are fast compared to the time scales associated with changes in hydrodynamical variables and are not modeled explicitly but are included in the dependency of the transport properties and thermodynamical coefficients. Thus, the production term is given by Alley and Alder [25]
Defining the Fourier transform as
and then substituting Eqs. (6) and (7) into Eq. (5) give, in Fourier space,
If one makes a particularly simple choice for the wavevector, then the dynamics can be decomposed into transverse (normal) and longitudinal (parallel) dynamics with respect to this wavevector. For example, if we select k = (0, k, 0), then from Eq. (9) the transverse dynamics are given by the streaming velocity components δũ{x} and δũ{z} via
where ν_{0} = η_{0}/ρ_{av} is the kinematic viscosity. We will use both the dynamic viscosity, η_{0}, and kinematic viscosity, ν_{0}, whenever one is more convenient than the other. As expected, Eqs. (10a) and (10b) are identical with respect to the dynamics and the transverse dynamics are independent of the energy and density fluctuations. The longitudinal dynamics are given by
where ν_{l} = (η_{v} + 4η_{0}/3)/ρ_{av} is the longitudinal kinematic viscosity and κ = λ/(c_{V}ρ_{av}).
As mentioned above, one usually does not study the fluctuating quantities directly but rather the associated correlation functions. To this end, we define the equilibrium time-correlation function between quantities A and B as
where V is the system volume. Thus, multiplying Eq. (10a) with δũ{x}(−k,0) and taking the ensemble average over initial conditions lead to
for the transverse relaxation. Here Cuu⊥=⟨δũ{x}(k,t)δũ{x}(−k,0)⟩/V is the transverse velocity autocorrelation function, and we have used that the stochastic forcing term is uncorrelated with the fluctuating quantities. The solution to Eq. (13) is
where the initial value Cuu⊥(k,0)=k_{B}T/ρ_{av} is found from equipartition [14].
From Eq. (11), one can form nine coupled correlation functions for the longitudinal dynamics. For example, dynamic equations for C_{ρρ}, C_{ρu}, and C_{ρe} are formed by multiplying Eq. (11a) with δρ̃(−k,0),δũ(−k,0) and δẽ(−k,0), respectively, and taking the ensemble average. In matrix notation, using the definition in Eq. (12) yields the following coupled linear differential equation system:
The coefficient matrix is referred to as the hydrodynamic matrix [26]. By performing the matrix multiplication in Eq. (15), it is seen that the longitudinal dynamics can be divided into three sets of co-dependent correlation functions, for example, Ċ_{ρρ} = A_{1}(C_{ρρ}, C_{uρ}), Ċ_{uρ} = A_{2}(C_{ρρ}, C_{uρ}, C_{eρ}), and Ċ_{eρ} = A_{3}(C_{ρρ}, C_{uρ}, C_{eρ}), where A_{1}, A_{2}, and A_{3} are linear functions represented by the hydrodynamic matrix. The three sets are written as triplets
and each set of coupled differential equations can be solved from the hydrodynamic matrix. Up to second order in the wavevector, the solution for any of the nine correlation functions has the form
where
are the thermal diffusivity and sound attenuation, respectively, and c_{s} defined as
is the adiabatic speed of sound. The three integrating factors K_{1}, K_{2}, and K_{3} are found from the initial conditions and are, in fact, not independent. Now, C_{AB} is either a real or purely imaginary valued function, which means that if K_{3} = 0, then in general K_{2} ≠ 0 and K_{1} ≠ 0 while if K_{3} ≠ 0 then K_{2} = K_{1} = 0. In the case where C_{AB} is real, the normalized correlation function is written in the form
Thus, the longitudinal dynamics are governed by three fundamental processes with frequencies D_{T}k^{2}, Γk^{2}, and c_{s}k. From Eq. (18), one sees that D_{T} pertains to the thermal processes and that the sound attenuation Γ dampens the wave propagation with speed c_{s}; the magnitude of this damping is governed by all three diffusive processes, i.e., by D, ν_{l}, and κ. Equations (14) and (20) form the framework for this hydrodynamics study.
III. SIMULATION METHODOLOGY
The standard DPD model by Groot and Warren is composed of a single type of point particle. The particle position, r_{i}, and momentum, p_{i}, follow Newton’s equation of motion,
The total force, F_{i}, is composed of the conservative force, FiC, due to the interaction between the particles, a random force, FiR, simulating the coarse graining of many degrees of freedom, and a dissipative force, FiD, removing the viscous heating generated from the random force. Thus F_{i}=FiC+FiR+FiD. As is common practice, we use reduced units such that the characteristic mass and length scales are set to unity. Also, temperature, T, is in units of k_{B}/ϵ, where ϵ is the characteristic energy scale. In reduced units the conservative force is
where a_{ij} is a parameter that quantifies the repulsion between particles i and j, r_{ij} is the vector of separation r_{i} − r_{j}, r_{ij} = |r_{ij}|, r^{ij}=r_{ij}/r_{ij}. Here we use a_{ij} = 25 and the interactions are ignored when r_{ij} > 1 = r_{c}. Following Groot and Warren [12], the random and dissipative forces are
where σ is the random force amplitude, ζ_{ij} is a uniformly distributed random number with zero mean and unit variance, w(r_{ij}) is a weighing function given by w(r_{ij}) = 1 − r_{ij}, v_{i} is the velocity of particle i, and Δt = 0.02 is the time step used in the integrator. In all simulations, the amplitude σ is set to 3.0 except for one simulation run where the effect of this parameter is discussed. The equations of motion are integrated using the standard velocity Verlet algorithm by Groot and Warren [12]. The system size is 5000 particles at density ρ_{av} = 3.0, and temperatures (in reduced units) in the range 0.1 ≤ T ≤ 1.0 are simulated.
Español and Serrano [33] studied the DPD model in terms of dimensionless parameters, namely, friction, Ω=σ^{2}r_{c}/(6v_{T}k_{B}Tm) where v_{T}=k_{B}T/m, an overlap parameter, s = r_{c}ρ^{1/3}, and system length scale, μ = L_{box}/r_{c}. For relatively large friction and overlap, the particle dynamics are affected by the surrounding fluid, that is, one would expect strong collective hydrodynamics. On the other hand, for low friction and small overlap, the dynamics are characterized by single particle properties described by what Español and Serrano call kinetic theory [33]. In the simulations carried out here, we only vary the temperature giving 1.5 ≤ Ω ≤ 14.7, s ≈ 1.4, and μ ≈ 6.9, and we span both the kinetic (high T) and hydrodynamic regime (low T).
During the simulations, all ten correlation functions are evaluated from the microscopic definition of the hydrodynamic variables, which to first order in fluctuations are
The viscosity at zero wavevector and frequency is also evaluated. Recently, based on generic projection methods [34,35], Jung and Schmid [36] argued that the correct Green-Kubo integral is
where the double index αβ runs over the xy, xz, and yz components of the pressure tensor; superscript II on η distinguishes it from a viscosity defined by Groot and Warren [12] and used below. PαβC are the three off-diagonal elements of the Irving-Kirkwood pressure tensor [37]
and PαβD and PαβR are the dissipative and random off-diagonal components of the tensors
Other authors have evaluated the viscosity based on the Irving-Kirkwood pressure only
We will compare the predictions from the hydrodynamic theory using both definitions, Eqs. (25) and (28). The complex viscosity is calculated from the Irving-Kirkwood pressure tensor, i.e.,
Finally, the self-diffusivity coefficient, D_{s}, is evaluated from the Green-Kubo integral of the single particle velocity autocorrelation function. We find that this leads to lower statistical uncertainties compared to evaluating D_{s} using the particle mean-square displacements.
In a few cases, the dynamics of the DPD model are compared to a liquid-phase Lennard-Jones system at the state-point (ρ, T) = (0.85, 1.121) in units of σ^{3} and k_{B}/ϵ. The Lennard-Jones particles interact through the standard shifted 12-6 potential [38] using a cutoff distance at r/σ = 2.5. The system size is N = 1000, and the equations of motion are integrated using the leap-frog method [39]. To control the temperature, the Nose-Hoover thermostat [40,41] is used. The dynamic properties are calculated as explained above.
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
It is informative to study the fluid structure for the different state points investigated. Figure 1(a) plots the radial distribution functions for three state points, namely, T = 1.00, 0.40, and 0.10; recall the density is always ρ_{av} = 3.0. The structure can be compared to the corresponding transport properties in Table I. First, one sees that the Schmidt number Sc = ν_{0}/D_{s} is around 1 for T > 0.6 and that the viscosity decreases for decreasing temperature in the range 0.8 ≤ T ≤ 1.0, which is the well-known gas-like behavior [14] and also reported by Boromand et_al [5] In agreement with this, the radial distribution function shows very little fluid structure in this temperature region.
At the lowest temperature T = 0.10, there is a clear fluid structure and the Schmidt number is of order 10^{2}. There are no indications that the system is crystalline for this temperature; for example, the mean square displacement does not feature any long time plateau, indicating no caging of the particles, and a fluidic diffusive behavior is observed after a short time, see Fig. 1(b). For reference, the Lennard-Jones liquid state point is characterized by Sc ≈ 50. It is interesting that for T = 0.40, a clear fluid structure is also absent in agreement with a Schmidt number of unity and a viscosity of η0I=0.778±0.004 and η0II=1.00±0.01, close to that of T = 1.0.
To study the mechanical properties further, we evaluate the shear modulus G* = G′ + iG″ = iωη*; the loss modulus is plotted in Fig. 2 for T = 1.00, 0.20 and 0.10. Data are compared to a single-element Maxwell model
where the Maxwell relaxation time, τ_{M}, is found from the peak frequency in the data and using amplitude G_{0} as fitting parameter. The instantaneous shear modulus (infinite-frequency complex shear modulus), G_{∞}, can then be found from the relation η_{0}/τ_{M} = G_{∞}. Both τ_{M} and G_{∞} are listed in Table I. From Fig. 2(a), it is seen that for T = 1.00 and ω < 20, the DPD model is Maxwellian, or equivalently, that the shear relaxation follows a simple exponential decay for t > π/10. For T = 0.10, the single-element Maxwell model breaks down at around ω = 0.4. As the temperature decreases, τ_{M} increases; thus, the shear relaxation slows down as expected. We also test for time-temperature superposition (TTS) in Fig. 2(b). Here the frequency is scaled by a factor a_{T} = η_{0}(T)/η_{0}(T_{ref}) and the magnitude of G* by b_{T} = T_{ref}/T [42], where the reference temperature is T_{ref} = 1.00. TTS applies for sufficiently low frequencies but fails around ω ≈ 1/τ_{M}. The shift factor a_{T} increases by a factor of ∼6 as temperature decreases by an order of magnitude.
Next, we turn to the non-zero wavevector regime. We plot in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) the transverse velocity autocorrelation for different wavevectors at temperatures T = 1.00 and 0.40. It is clearly seen that the hydrodynamical theory, Eq. (14), predicts the transverse relaxation dynamics very well in the low vector regime using the Irving-Kirkwood definition of the pressure tensor. Applying the Jung-Schmid definition gives too fast a relaxation, which indicates that this particular dynamical mode is not dependent on the random and dissipative shear forces. More quantitatively, the theory predicts the half-life as t_{1/2} = ln(2)/(ν_{0}k^{2}), i.e., for T = 0.4 we have t_{1/2} = 9.5 using η0I=0.78 and t_{1/2} = 7.4, using η0II=1.00. This can be compared to the simulation result t_{1/2} = 9.5. For very short times, the theory fails to predict the relaxation; this is to be expected as the viscosity is in general both frequency and wavevector dependent; hence, for sufficiently short times, the time dependence of the viscosity is important.
Interestingly, the agreement is less satisfactory for T = 1.0; here the Irving-Kirkwood definition yields t_{1/2} = 10.4 versus the simulation result t_{1/2} = 11.2. In Fig. 4, we plot the mean square deviation
where Cuu⊥(k,t_{i}) is the predictions from the theory and Cuu,k,t_{i}⊥ simulation data. To avoid this parameter being affected by the large noise-to-signal ratio at very long times, we only sum over the N_{s} times with data points Cuu⊥(k,t)/Cuu⊥(k,0)≥0.1. Clearly, the minimum deviation is found within the temperature region 0.3 ≤ T ≤ 0.7. In this region, the Schmidt number is of the order of unity; hence, we here reach the same conclusion as Jiang et_al [17] For higher temperatures, the agreement is not as satisfactory; here we approach the kinetic regime as defined by Español and Serrano [33], that is, low friction and overlap parameters mentioned above. For low temperatures, one observes a quite large deviation, especially pronounced for larger wavevectors. This, we argue, is due to the large characteristic frequency, ω = ν_{0}k^{2}, which is outside the classical hydrodynamic regime. For T = 0.1, this hydrodynamic regime is never reached because of the limitations on the wavevector k_{min} = 2π/L_{box}.
Fourier-Laplace transformation of Eq. (14) leads to
which gives a peak in the imaginary part of the spectrum at ω_{peak} = ν_{0}k^{2}. This peak frequency found from the simulations is plotted in Fig. 5(a) for T = 1.00 and T = 0.40 together with the hydrodynamic predictions. For low wavevectors, the peak frequency follows the predictions: ω_{peak} is proportional to k^{2} and the relaxation is governed by the diffusion of momentum. The prediction fails for larger wavevectors; at lower temperature, the deviation is significant for relatively lower wavevectors compared to high temperature. Again, we attribute this to the large characteristic frequency at low temperature and large wavevector. The frequency and wavevector dependent shear viscosity can be defined by re-arranging Eq. (32),
This result can also be derived from first principles by including the position and time dependence of the transport coefficient in Eqs. (4). In the zero frequency limit, we have the viscosity kernel η̃(k)=k_{B}T/k^{2}C^uu⊥(k,0). Figure 5(b) shows this viscosity kernel at zero frequency for T = 1.00, 0.40, and T = 0.20. The zero wavevector viscosity is also indicated using η0I from Table I. It is interesting to see that for k less than unity, the wavevector-dependent viscosity reaches η_{0}, i.e., the local Newtonian law of viscosity holds for k < 1.0. This is observed (in appropriate reduced units) for many different fluids [16]. We also note that Ripoll et_al [11] studied the kernel for zero conservative force.
Rather than approaching the deviation between theory and simulation through wavevector dependent transport coefficients, one can generalize the stochastic forcing and assume δJ^{m}, δP, and δJ^{e} to be correlated with hydrodynamic quantities. In this case, the transverse dynamics are governed by the equation
where
Applying a Fourier-Laplace transform gives the correlation between forcing and the transverse velocity in terms of wavevector and frequency as
Because the theoretical predictions are relatively large for higher temperatures, the contribution from ε is larger for all wavevectors compared to the intermediate temperatures.
We now turn to the longitudinal relaxation dynamics and focus first on the density autocorrelation function, C_{ρρ}. It is worth noting that this is related to the coherent intermediate scattering function, F(k, t), by C_{ρρ}(k, t) = ρ_{av}F(k, t). The density autocorrelation function is a real-valued function and, hence, it relaxes according to Eq. (20); it is plotted in Fig. 6(a) for T = 1.00 at wavevectors k = 0.53, 2.12, and 5.30. The dashed line is the best fit of Eq. (20) to data using K_{ρρ}, D_{T}, Γ, and c_{s} as fitting parameters. The damped oscillations predicted from hydrodynamics are evident, indicating sound waves that are dampened by the sound attenuation coefficient, Γ. The existence of the thermal process is less clear. To study this in more detail, we investigate the corresponding spectra. The Fourier-Laplace transform of Eq. (20) is
Again, note the two different contributions to the relaxation. The real part of C^ρρN is symmetric about ω = 0 and we therefore only discuss the behavior for ω ≥ 0. The first term relates to the thermal process and gives rise to the Rayleigh peak at ω = 0; this process is only present at low frequencies and the half-width of the Rayleigh peak is D_{T}k^{2}. The second term has a peak at frequency ω_{peak} = c_{s}k; the maximum is identified as the Brillouin peak and has half width 2Γk^{2}. Inspired by Hansen and McDonald [26], the peaks and their widths are illustrated in Fig. 6(c). Figures 6(b) and 6(c) show the real part of the spectrum of the density autocorrelation function for wavevectors k = 0.53 and k = 5.30, the highest wavevector studied. Using the fitted values obtained in Fig. 6(a), we plot the predicted spectra together with the transformed data. The agreement is not perfect as the local minimum predicted by the theory (at ω ≈ 4 for k = 5.3) is not found in the spectrum of the data. Fitting to Eq. (37) did not improve this. For T = 1.0 and relatively small wavevectors, Fig. 6(b), the thermal process is almost completely absent and the relaxation is athermal. However, for large wavevector, Fig. 6(c), the process is indeed observed in the spectrum.
The ratio of the two processes is quantified from the Landau-Placzek ratio [43], that is, the ratio between the Rayleigh and Brillouin integral regions, or intensities, I_{R}/2I_{B} = γ − 1, where γ itself is the ratio between the heat capacities at constant pressure and volume, γ = C_{P}/C_{v}. The integral regions are also illustrated in Fig. 6(c). In Fig. 7(a), we plot the dispersion relation for γ for different temperatures. It is clear that the thermal process intensity increases as we decrease the temperature and wavelength. For reference, the Lennard-Jones liquid features 1.6 ≤ γ ≤ 2.6 for 0.46 ≤ k ≤ 5.9, see also Bryk et_al [44] In this region, the Lennard-Jones system also shows a clear de Gennes narrowing [26]; we have not observed this narrowing for the wavevectors and temperatures studied here. From Fig. 6(c), it is seen that the frequencies of two processes overlap, indicating that the processes are coupled; this coupling is only present on relatively small length scales. That is, for typical simulation setups, these two processes are decoupled and, furthermore, the thermal process only accounts for a small fraction of the hydrodynamic relaxation. However, for T = 0.10, the coupling is relatively large even on longer length scales and may affect the response considerably.
The dispersion relation for the Brillouin peak frequency, ω_{peak}, is plotted in Fig. 7(b); it is seen that the oscillatory frequencies are roughly the same for the different temperatures at sufficiently small wavevector, which means that the speed of sound is to a good approximation independent of temperature on these length scales. For larger wavevectors, the discrepancy between T = 0.10 and T > 0.10 is pronounced; the underlying mechanical reason for this is not well known, but likely due to the different local liquid structure on these small scales, see, for example, Ref [45], but also the coupling of the longitudinal processes can be important. It is worth noting that the maxima seen in Fig. 7(b) are also observed in the Lennard-Jones liquid. From the simulation data, we cannot conclude if the DPD model features positive or negative dispersion [44,45].
In Fig. 8(a), we plot the density-density, density-energy, and energy-energy correlation functions at T = 0.10 for two different wavevectors. It is seen that these three different correlation functions have the same characteristics as discussed above, in agreement with the hydrodynamic predictions. That is, the standard DPD system includes the cross coupling between the longitudinal quantities hydrodynamically, at least qualitatively. As mentioned above, the speed of sound c_{s}, sound attenuation Γ, and thermal diffusion coefficient D_{T} entering the hydrodynamic relaxation functions depend on the DPD parameters. To show this, we plot the density-density correlation function in Fig. 8(b) for σ = 6.0 and T = 0.10 for different wavevectors. These results can be compared with Fig. 8(a). Recall that increasing the random force amplitude and keeping all other parameters fixed correspond to increasing the dimensionless friction coefficient Ω, that is, increasing the interactions with the surrounding liquid. One can clearly observe that the Rayleigh integral region significantly increases relative to that of the Brillouin integral region. Also, the Brillouin peak is shifted to the right as the density waves propagate with higher speeds as a result of the increased DPD-particle interactions.
V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, the equilibrium relaxations of the standard dissipative particle dynamics model proposed by Groot and Warren [12] were investigated. First, the well-known results that the structure and dynamics at high temperatures (T ≥ 0.8) resemble those of a gas were recaptured; this region in phase space is accordingly denoted as the kinetic regime [33]. At lower temperatures, the viscosity increases with decreasing temperature and the Schmidt number approaches that of the model Lennard-Jones liquid. The DPD model features a single-element Maxwellian shear modulus relaxation behavior for sufficiently small frequencies that depends on the temperature; the lower the temperature, the smaller the frequencies are required to observe Maxwellian behavior. Also, the time-temperature superposition principle is applicable in the low frequency regime.
For nonzero wavevectors, the hydrodynamic prediction for the transverse velocity autocorrelation function is tested using the Jung-Schmid and the Irving-Kirkwood definitions of the viscosity; the former includes the random and dissipative shear force contributions, whereas the latter only includes the conservative and kinetic contributions. Using the Irving-Kirkwood viscosity, the hydrodynamic predictions are in excellent agreement with simulations results for temperatures 0.4 ≤ T ≤ 0.7 and k_{y} ≤ 2.12. Importantly, using the Jung-Schmid viscosity overestimates the relaxation, indicating that the transverse relaxation dynamics are independent of the dissipative and random shear forces. Also, for higher temperatures, the agreement is less satisfactory for a given wavevector, in accordance with the Bocquet-Chaix criterion.
A qualitative investigation into the longitudinal dynamics was also carried out. For the high temperature regime (T ≥ 0.8), the spectrum for the density autocorrelation function at low wavevectors is characterized by a single sharp Brillouin peak. This indicates that the longitudinal relaxation is athermal and dominated by propagating damped density waves. This mechanism is very different compared to a simple liquid, in which the thermal diffusion process dominates at low wavevector. In the low temperature range, the Rayleigh peak is more prominent: a fingerprint of the thermal diffusion process. Dispersion relations for the Landau-Placzek ratio show that the thermal process intensity increases compared to the wave propagation process as the length scale decreases; this is true for all temperatures and wavevectors studied and also the case for the Lennard-Jones liquid, even though the Landau-Placzek ratio is larger here. For the supercritical fluid Lennard-Jones model, there is a small increase in the speed-of-sound with respect to temperature [44]; however, for the DPD model, this is constant with respect to temperature for k < 2. Finally, the DPD model features the cross couplings predicted by the theory, at least qualitatively.
In conclusion, the thermal fluctuations in the standard coarse grained DPD model by Groot and Warren [12] preserve, at least qualitatively, the underlying mechanical processes predicted by the classical hydrodynamic theory. Therefore, the model can be used to study fluctuating hydrodynamics as stated by Español and Warren [13]. However, we suggest that one chooses parameter settings where the system is away from the kinetic (or gaseous) regime.
TABLE I. 
Table of the viscosities, η0I and η0II, the self-diffusivity, D_{s}, the Schmidt number, Sc, the Maxwell relaxation time, τ_{M}, and instantaneous shear modulus, G_{∞}. The two values for the Schmidt number are for η0I/(ρD_{s}) and η0II/(ρD_{s}). The uncertainties associated with the viscosities are the standard deviation of the mean calculated from five independent simulations. There are no statistical uncertainty on the digits for D_{s} and Sc. G_{∞} is calculated from the sample averages of η0I and τ_{M} with one significant decimal place.
