Multifunctional hybrid diode: Study of photoresponse, high responsivity, and charge injection mechanisms
A multifunctional hybrid heterojunction diode is developed on porous silicon and its current density-voltage characteristics reveal a good rectification ratio along with other superior parameters such as ideality factor, barrier height and series resistance. The diode also functions as an efficient photodiode to manifest high photosensitivity with high responsivity under illumination with broadband solar light, UV light, and green light. The diode is also carefully scrutinized for its sensitivity and repeatability over many cycles under UV and green light and is found to have a quick response and extremely fast recovery times. The notable responsivity is attributed to the generation of high density of excitons in the depletion region by the absorption of incident photons and their separation by an internal electric field besides an additional photocurrent due to the charging of polymer chains. The mechanisms of generation, injection and transport of charge carriers are explained by developing a schematic energy band diagram. The transport phenomenon of carriers is further investigated from room temperature down to a very low temperature of 10 K. An Arrhenius plot is made to determine the Richardson constant. Various diode parameters as mentioned above are also determined and the dominance of the transport mechanism of charge carriers in different temperature regimes such as diffusion across the junction and/or quantum tunneling through the barriers are explained. The developed multifunction heterojunction hybrid diodes have implications for highly sensitive photodiodes in the UV and visible range of electromagnetic spectrum that can be very promising for efficient optoelectronic devices.
I. INTRODUCTION
Organic-inorganic hybrid thin films provide a new approach for various technological applications in electronic, optoelectronic, and resistive switching memory devices [1–3]. Especially, their low cost, large area for mechanical flexibility, and high carrier mobility make them ideally suited for the fabrication of high frequency, low power, and flexible electronic devices [4,5]. Recently, various inorganic/organic based hybrid photodiodes have been made using a blend structure of an inorganic semiconductor and a conjugated polymer semiconductor [6,7]. Such hybrid devices have become innovative alternatives for next generation hybrid photodiodes [8] and hybrid solar cells [9], because they combine the advantages of two materials, like high electron mobility and photosensitivity of inorganic semiconductors and high hole mobility, photosensitivity and excellent optical properties of conjugated polymer semiconductors [9,10]. The charge carrier mobilities of polymer semiconductors on the order of 10^{−5} to 0.1 cm^{2}/V s have already been reported [11], which are much comparable to the mobility of amorphous silicon. The highest mobility of carriers in thin film electronic devices based on conducting polymer semiconductors can be obtained if the molecules recommence a predominate orientation such that the direction of intermolecular π-π stacking occurs parallel to the substrate [12]. Yuan et_al reported a simple photodiode based on well-aligned ZnO nanowire arrays and a regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) hybrid heterojunction, which exhibits a high rectification ratio (RR) 3211 at 2 V [8]. Such a high value of RR has been attributed to the high electron mobility of ZnO nanowires and the formation of a large intimate zinc oxide nanowire arrays (ZNAs)/P3HT interface of the hybrid device [13,14]. A hybrid solar cell has also been demonstrated by Ji et_al using a blended structure of nanocrystalline ZnO (nc-ZnO) and conjugated polymer regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as the active layer of the solar cell [15]. However, this device shows very low power conversion efficiency due to the poor interfacial junction between organic and inorganic materials, and a series of good attempts have been made for the improvement of the heterojunction between two materials [16–18]. Still, a better understanding of the transport of charge carriers in this field is necessary, especially of the interfacial junction properties and their charge transport characteristics. Therefore, in order to investigate the effect of the interfacial layers and trap states on the performance of a hybrid diode, temperature dependent studies of hybrid diode parameters have been analyzed using various transport models. The ideality factor and the barrier height determined from the forward bias current-voltage (I-V) characteristics are found to be a strong function of temperature as the linearity of a diode gets affected and the barrier height decreases with decreasing temperature [19]. There are numerous temperature dependent studies on organic semiconductor devices. In particular, polymer-metal Schottky barrier diodes have been investigated using different polymers. Such Schottky barrier diodes using poly(3-octylthiophene)/aluminium have been studied by Assadi et_al [20] They analyzed the temperature dependence of I-V in the range 170–370 K. They observed that at higher temperatures, the diffusion mechanism is dominant and for temperatures less than the room temperature tunneling is proposed to be the dominant current transport mechanism. Later, Li et_al found a large inhomogeneity in the Schottky barrier height in a temperature-dependent study on high-performance organic solar cells [21].
This work emphasizes on the effective design of a hybrid device with appropriate materials selection for future large-area, low cost and high sensitivity hybrid photodiode, photovoltaic, and low temperature hybrid optoelectronic devices using an economical viable ultrasonication cast technique. The present study reports the development of a Ag/ZnO:P3OT/porous silicon (PS)/p-Si/Al hybrid heterojunction diode that consists of nc-ZnO as an electron acceptor and poly(3-octylthiophene) organic conducting polymer as a hole conductor [22]. Further, for understanding the photophysics of hybrid devices, we proposed a schematic energy band diagram in terms of the HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) and LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital) levels on the basis of the existing literature. The performance of the resulting hybrid photodiode in the dark and under simulated solar light illumination was systematically investigated. The study of hybrid photodiodes in terms of photosensitivity and responsivity under solar illumination is discussed. Therefore, this manuscript emphasizes the effective design and the performance of the developed hybrid diode in terms of high photosensitivity and responsivity under UV, green, and solar light illumination along with an understanding of the photophysics. Furthermore, the temperature dependence of the current density-voltage (J-V) characteristics of this hybrid diode in the range from 300 K to 10 K was also studied. Particular emphasis is devoted to understanding the various diode parameters, and a solution for several controversial points and the dominance of the transport mechanisms of charge carriers in different temperature regimes such as diffusion across the junction and/or quantum tunneling through the barriers are explained.
II. EXPERIMENTAL
The Ag/ZnO:P3OT/PS/p-Si/Al hybrid heterojunction was fabricated by casting a hybrid thin film on porous silicon using economical viable ultrasonication cast technique, and the schematic of the device is shown in Fig. 1(a). PS was formed using a process of electrochemical anodization of a boron-doped polished Si [100] wafer with a low resistivity of ∼14–22 Ω cm. Anodization was carried out in a HF (48 %) and ethanol (98 %) based solution in a volumetric ratio of 1:1 with a constant current density of 90 mA/cm^{2} for 37 s. nc-ZnO was synthesized by a chemical route using a sol-gel process, as per details given previously by our group [9]. The blended structure of ZnO with P3OT is developed by ultrasonically mixing at constant temperature and environment on a PS layer. The well-dispersed nc-ZnO embedded in the P3OT chain structure forms an ample donor/acceptor interface. The morphology of ZnO:P3OT and the PS layer is determined using Field Emission-Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) and Energy Dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy, and the details are given in the supplementary material data. Al metal contact was formed on the entire backside of p-Si substrates using thermal evaporation technique and the top contact on the film was made using silver paste. The absorbance of the hybrid film was measured using a Hitachi spectrophotometer (UH4150). The photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of the hybrid film was recorded using an excitation source consisting of a He-Cd laser (KIMMON) at 442 nm (100 mW) and a spectrometer from Ocean Optics (HR4000). Raman spectroscopy (RS) measurements were performed under excitation of a 514.5 nm argon ion laser at 5 mW power using a Renishaw InVia Raman microscope. The current density-voltage (J-V) characteristics of the Ag/ZnO:P3OT/PS/p-Si/Al hybrid diode were studied in the dark and under simulated solar light illumination using a class AAA solar simulator from PET, USA equipped with a Keithley source meter, Model-2401 at IUAC, and the details of the system are elaborated by our group elsewhere [23]. The current-time (I-t) characteristics of the hybrid photodiode were also studied using a Keithley source meter, Model-2410 under UV (365 nm) and green (520 nm) light at Delhi University. Low temperature I-V measurements of the hybrid diode were performed in the wide temperature range of 300 K–10 K using a setup equipped with a Keithley source meter (2182 A), a Lakeshore temperature controller (321, sensitivity better than ±0.1 K) attached with a CTI cryogenic closed cycle refrigerator (CCR) cryostat under a vacuum of ∼ 10^{−3 }Torr at IUAC, New Delhi.
III. RESULTS
A. Structural and multi-functional device characteristics at room temperature
Figure 1(a) shows the schematic of the device structure of the Ag/ZnO:P3OT/PS/p-Si/Al hybrid heterojunction diode including a hybrid ZnO:P3OT layer on a porous silicon substrate. The bottom Al metal contact is made on the backside of p-type Si and the Ag contact is connected on the top of ZnO:P3OT for applying an external bias. The well-dispersed nc-ZnO embedded in the P3OT chain structure forms an ample donor/acceptor interface. Figure 1(b) shows the optical absorption and PL spectra of the hybrid thin film. It may be noted that for UV-visible light measurements, the hybrid thin film was deposited on a corning glass. It is observed that the hybrid film shows very high molecular absorption in the UV-visible range 350–650 nm. The hybrid film showed an absorption maximum peak around 520 nm with a weak shoulder around 600 nm. These absorptions are associated mainly due to the occurrence of π−π* electronic transitions of the benzenoid ring of P3OT polymer. The maximum peak at 520 nm is attributed to the electronic state transition of a P3OT molecule due to strong inter-chain interaction. The peak at 600 nm is correlated to the vibronic state transition of a P3OT molecule due to weak inter-chain interaction. The PL spectrum of the hybrid film is shown in Fig. 1(b), which exhibits one very high intensity and saturated peak around 455 nm and a very broad emission band around 660 nm. It may be noted that this emission around 455 nm is the excitation peak of the 442 nm laser line of the HeCd laser as we have not used any kind of notch or edge filter for suppressing the excitation line during the measurements. It is also known that when the high intensity laser line is detected by such sensitive spectrometers, it exhibits drifts in the position and an increase in the width of the line; as a matter of fact, the excitation line seems to be around 455 nm. The full spectrum is given in the supplementary materials. For further clarity, the PL emission band has been de-convoluted into three emission peaks (details are given in the supplementary material) at 660 nm, 711 nm and around 718 nm, respectively. The origin of these emission peaks is associated with the P3OT polymer [24]. The first peak (660 nm) is attributed to the radical oxidation of the side chain of thiophene rings and the second peak (711 nm) is due to the diffusion of molecular oxygen through the P3OT matrix, which is favorable to the formation of a charge transfer complex (CTC) between the electrons delocalized on the polymer backbones and oxygen radical anions [24]. The third peak at 718 nm can be correlated to the formation of aromatic and quinone segments [25,26]. The films were also well characterized for their structural properties using micro-Raman spectroscopy and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction technique, and details are given in the supplementary material.
Figure 2(a) shows the current density-voltage (J–V) characteristics of the Ag/ZnO:P3OT/PS/p-Si/Al heterojunction hybrid diode in the bias voltage range of ±3 V under dark and simulated solar light illumination conditions. Under dark conditions, it is clearly observed that the diode reveals a high rectification ratio with a maximum forward current density of ∼68 mA/cm^{2} and a reverse current density of ∼−4.6 μA/cm^{2} at +3 V and −3 V, respectively. The response of the rectification ratio is plotted in different ± voltage ranges as shown in Fig. 2(b), and is found to be ∼1.4×10^{4} from the ratio of forward to reverse current density at ±3 V, which is much larger as compared to the reported ZNAs/P3HT based hybrid photodiode in the literature [8]. The observed high value of rectification ratio may be attributed to the well-connected nc-ZnO with the P3OT polymer for making a continuous electrical pathway for electrons to reach the electrode, the high hole mobility of the P3OT polymer or the formation of a large intimate ZnO:P3OT/PS/p-Si interface in the device. See the supplementary materials for the analysis of J-V characteristic to determine various diode parameters.
The value of J_{s} is calculated and found to be ∼2.25 × 10^{−8} A/cm^{2}. Moreover, the values of the ideality factor and the barrier height are found to be 1.70 and 0.29 eV, respectively. Details are given online in supplementary materials.
A considerable deviation from linearity in the forward J-V characteristic of the hybrid diode generally comes from the effect of series resistance (R_{s}) due to the existence of interface defect states and the interfacial layer. This resistance plays a vital role in the current path at the heterojunction and provides a leakage pathway to minority charge carriers in the device. In addition, the value of R_{s} is also calculated using the Cheung relation [27] and can be written as
where the term JAR_{s} refers to the voltage drop across the series resistance of the hybrid heterojunction diode. Hence, the plot of dV/d (lnJ) vs J, shown in Fig. 2(c), is a straight line for the data for the downward curvature region of the forward bias, whose slope (AR_{s}) will give the series resistance (R_{s}) value, and the intercept (η.K_{B}T/q) of the plot will give the value of ideality factor (η). The values of R_{s} and η are observed to be 2.9 kΩ and 1.67, respectively. To find the value of Φ_{B}, we can define the H (J) as
where HJ can be written as HJ=JAR_{s}+ηϕ_{B}; using this relation, the value of η is calculated from Eq. (2); and a plot of H(J) vs J is shown in Fig. 2(d), which will also give a straight line with the y-axis intercept equal to ηΦ_{B}. R_{s} can be determined from the slope of this plot, which gives the second determination of R_{s} and provides the framework for this approach. The values of Φ_{B} and R_{s} are found to be ∼0.30 eV and ∼2.9 kΩ, respectively. The obtained value of R_{s} remains approximately the same for both plots H(J) vs. J and dV/d (lnJ) vs J. In addition, the values of η and Φ_{B} are also in agreement with the previously obtained values from the forward J-V curve.
The photoresponse of the hybrid diode under illumination of 100 mW/cm^{2} simulated solar light at +3 V to −3 V voltage reveals that the reverse current of the hybrid diode is increased by a factor of ∼1000. The photosensitivity (i.e., [J_{ill}−J_{dark}J_{dark}], is depicted in Fig. 3(a) as a function of bias voltage. The maximum value of photosensitivity is obtained around ∼4295 at −1.7 V. This is higher than the recently reported photosensitivity for the P3HT/CdS photodiode [28]. As expected, the photosensitivity for the forward bias voltage exceeding the open circuit voltage (V_{oc}) of about 120 mV is unity. For V > V_{oc}, the photocurrent becomes negligible as compared with dark forward current.
The responsivity (R) of the hybrid diode is calculated as the photocurrent density (J_{ph}) generated per unit incident light (E_{inc}) and can be defined as
Figure 3(b) shows the variation of responsivity as a function of reverse bias voltage. This responsivity of the hybrid diode increases from nearly zero at small bias to about ∼0.15 A/W at –3 V, which is much comparable to the previously observed responsivity based on an organic photodetector [29]. Therefore, one can say that this device has much improved responsivity under illumination of solar light, and it is attributed to the generation of high density of electron-hole pairs, i.e., excitons in the active region of the device by the absorption of photons and their separation by an induced internal electric field in the depletion region. In addition, the photocurrent under solar light illumination is also due to charging of the polymer chains. The photocurrent depends on photo-generated electron-hole pairs which are close to the junction region or in the range of diffusion length. This means that the hybrid film has absorption mostly in the 350–650 nm UV-visible range. It can be seen that the absorption coefficient values of the organic semiconductor and PS are very high in this region. Therefore, the photocurrent in the hybrid device will be observed at incident photon energies higher than the band gap of the P3OT polymer (hv > E_{g}^{P3OT}) (1.83 eV) and the band gap of PS (hv > E_{g}^{PS}) (1.82 eV). This result probably identified that the device operates under reverse bias conditions; hence, the width of the depletion region can be expected to get extended, which is responsible for the absorption of photons. The photo-generated electrons diffuse to the side of the ZnO:P3OT film and most of the holes are expected to diffuse to the backside of the p-Si substrate and collect by the back Al contact, as the interface of the ZnO:P3OT film has a high valence band barrier for them.
It is clear from J-V analysis that at zero applied bias, the photocurrent density is low ∼6 × 10^{−2}μA/cm^{2} and at a higher applied reverse bias, the photocurrent density value is much higher ∼15 mA/cm^{2} at −3 V. However, it is not certain that materials are responsible for high photocurrent and responsivity, but absorbance results reveal that the nc-ZnO:P3OT layer has strong absorption in the wavelength range of 350–650 nm as the absorption coefficient of organic semiconductors is very high in this region. Therefore, the photocurrent in the nc-ZnO:P3OT layer will be observed if the incident photons have higher energy than the band gap of the P3OT polymer (hv > E_{g}^{P3OT}) (1.83 eV). Here, it can also be noticed that nc-ZnO present in the P3OT polymer chain is also responsible for the absorption of UV range photons and the embedded nc-ZnO in P3OT will also absorb the scattered UV photons from the P3OT structure up to the UV photon penetration depth. This nc-ZnO also contributes to the photocurrent and provides the conduction path to enhance charge carrier conduction through the device. The remaining fraction of visible-near IR photons (∼680–1100 nm) may transmit through the PS layer (hv < E_{g}^{PS}, 1.82 eV) to the crystalline p-Si part, also contributing to the photocurrent. However, the large porosity of PS may lead to a maximum scattering loss of incoming photons. Therefore, the generation of charge carriers in the nc-ZnO:P3OT layer is much more than at the PS interface. In the present case, nc-ZnO will provide the continuous conduction pathway to diffuse photo-generated electrons to collect at Ag contact. Moreover, photo-generated holes are expected to diffuse to the backside of the p-Si side and collect at the Al contact, as the interface of ZnO:P3OT represents a high valence band barrier for them. Thus, it may be concluded that responsivity ∼0.15 A/W and photocurrent are mainly due to the generation of high density of excitons in the hybrid film upon the absorption of UV-visible photons.
The current-time (I-t) characteristics of the hybrid photodiode under UV (365 nm @ power density of 100 μW/cm^{2}) and green light (520 nm @ power density of 4.4 μW/cm^{2}) at an applied voltage of −1.7 V are studied as shown in Fig. 4(a). The results clearly reveal that the hybrid photodiode exhibits very good repeatability over many cycles as evident from on/off cycles. The on/off ratio is observed to be <100, <10 for UV and green light, respectively. The rise time under UV light is found to be 8.9 s as shown in Fig. 4(b) and is attributed to the relatively high resistance at the interface of the hybrid diode. This effectively affects the electron-hole separation and deteriorates carrier transport at the interface. However, photocurrent exhibits a relatively very fast recovery time of 190 ms as shown in Fig. 4(c) and can be understood by the inherent fast recombination of electrons-holes at the interface. From these experimental data, one can say that the responsivity is also determined under UV light illumination as discussed previously in this section and is found to be 1.04 A/W, which is very high as compared to the reported data on such organic based hybrid photodiodes [29]. Furthermore, the time response under green light exhibits rise and recovery times of 9.8 s and 90 ms, respectively. Interestingly, the responsivity is also calculated to be 3.08 A/W and claimed to be extremely high under green light illumination compared to the similar investigations in the literature for P3HT based hybrid photodiodes with different structures in visible and near infrared regions such as P3HT/ZnO nanowires, 310 mA/W at −2 V [30], P3HT/(PCBM), 180 mA/W at −6 V [31], PbS-QDs:P3HT:PCBM BH, 130–500 mA/W at −5 V [32], P3HT/F8TBT, 100 mA/W at −0.5 V [33], (PEDOT:PSS)/P3HT:PCBM 360 mA/W at −5 V [34]. The results of the UV-visible absorption spectrum confirmed that the hybrid film exhibits maximum absorption in the visible region. Therefore, the width of the depletion region for photogenerated electron-hole pairs by absorption of green photons is considered to be larger as compared to UV photons due to the larger penetration depth of green photons, leading to remarkable high responsivity.
The photo-induced generation of electron-hole pairs and their effective separation in the Ag/ZnO:P3OT/PS/p-Si/Al heterojunction hybrid diode are understood by a schematic energy band diagram under equilibrium at zero bias and under illumination at −3 V applied bias voltage as shown in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b). Here, E_{g} shows the band gap values for ZnO (3.3 eV), P3OT (1.83 eV), PS (1.82 eV), and Si (1.1 eV), respectively. The work function (eΦ_{m}) values of 4.5 eV and 4.3 eV for Ag and Al are used. The electron affinity (eχ) values are obtained for ZnO (∼4.1 eV), P3OT (∼3.76 eV), PS (∼4.04 eV), and p-Si (∼4.05 eV), respectively. The conduction band offset (ΔE_{c}) and valence band offsets (ΔE_{v}) can be calculated as ΔEc=χ_{ZnO}−χ_{P3OT}=0.34eV,ΔEc=χ_{P3OT}−χ_{PS}=0.28eV,andΔEc=χ_{PS}−χ_{Si}=0.01eVandΔEv=E_{g,ZnO}−E_{g,P3OT}+ΔE{c}=1.81eV,ΔEv=E_{g,P3OT}−E_{g,PS}+ΔE{c}=0.30eV,andΔEv=E_{g,PS}−E_{g,Si}+ΔE{c}=0.72eV respectively. The low ΔE{c} and high ΔEv values reveal that the energetic barrier for electrons is much less than that for holes. Therefore, injected electrons can easily move across the barrier. Under equilibrium and in the absence of bias voltage, the Fermi level is uniform throughout the structure and band bending upward in ZnO, P3OT polymer and PS and downward in the p-Si semiconductor near the interface.
Under illumination and a reverse bias, the Fermi level of ZnO moves towards conduction, whereas the Fermi level of P3OT moves towards the LUMO level and for PS and p-Si, it moves towards the valence band and remains constant throughout the hybrid structure. The curvature and tails at each junction get affected with the applied bias, the conduction band of ZnO bend towards the Fermi level, while the conduction band of rest moves away from the Fermi level and the transport of charge carriers under light illumination and a reverse bias are also shown in diagram. In the present hybrid device, nc-ZnO works as an electron acceptor making a continuous network pathway with the P3OT polymer which works as an electron donor. The light conversion into current under solar light illumination in a reverse bias happened in four consecutive fundamental processes. First, there is absorption of light in the active region of hybrid heterojunctions. Second, there is a formation of excited states and generation of electron hole pairs, i.e., excitons. Third, the exciton diffuses into a region where dissociation may occur into free charge, i.e., into electrons and holes separately. Fourth, transfer of the electrons and holes to the respective electrodes and the charge extraction take place. A schematic energy band diagram demonstrates that photo-generated electrons of the exciton drift from the LUMO of P3OT (electron donor) to nc-ZnO (electron acceptor) under a reverse bias and are collected by Ag contact. On the other hand, holes of ZnO move toward the HOMO of P3OT and are collected by Al contact.
The pre-coated Al metal contact on the PS/Si back side and the Ag contact on the ZnO:P3OT hybrid layer are used for collecting the generated and injected charge carriers. The p-Si substrate of 14–22 Ω cm resistivity reveals a low carrier concentration. Therefore, band bending is downward near the Al-Si interface and exhibits the formation of Schottky contact. The band bending is upward near the Ag-ZnO:P3OT interface, constituting another Schottky contact formation in the hybrid device. Under illumination and in a reverse bias, the depletion region at the Al-Si interface may not participate significantly in the generation of electron-hole pairs, because incident photons will not directly reach the Al-Si interface due to the less penetration depth of photons with an energy more than 1.82 eV. Similarly, the Ag-ZnO:P3OT interface may also not contribute significantly to the generation of electron-hole pairs, because the depletion width at the Ag-ZnO:P3OT interface is assumed to be very narrow and only provide the conduction path for electrons that can easily overcome the barrier. In hybrid heterojunction diodes, blending of nc-ZnO in the P3OT polymer provides the conduction path to charge carriers and enhanced the stability of polymer chains as well. Therefore, hybrid heterojunctions are beneficial to develop large-area, low cost and high quality hybrid photodiodes.
B. Diode characteristics at low temperatures
In this section, we study the temperature dependence of the J-V characteristic of the hybrid diode in the range from 300 K to 10 K shown in Figs. 6(a) and 6(b). The diode parameters are also calculated and variations of diode parameters with temperature are cited in Table I. The forward and reverse current show a strong dependence on temperature as forward current increases and reverse current decreases upon cooling down to lower temperatures. At a low bias voltage, the hybrid diode exhibits a linear behavior, but the considerable deviation at low temperatures from linearity in forward lnJ-V characteristic comes at a sufficiently higher bias voltage which is attributed to the effect of series resistance. As the linear region of the lnJ-V plot is reduced, the accuracy in the determination of the values of the ideality factor and the barrier height becomes poorer.
The ideality factor and the barrier height are determined from the forward J-V characteristics and plotted in Fig. 7(a). It is observed that the ideality factor reveals an increase with decreasing temperature, whereas the barrier height decreases with decreasing temperature. Such a phenomenon should be depicted with the Gaussian distribution of the barrier height [21,35]. Therefore, barrier height lowering and an increase in the ideality factor with decreasing measurement temperature reveal that barrier inhomogeneity exists at the hybrid interface and consists of inhomogeneous patches of different barrier heights [36]. It can be imagined that at low temperatures, the density of carriers will decrease and carriers are only able to surmount the lower barriers, so that the charge carriers prefer to go across the inhomogeneous lower barrier height patches, which is concluded by an apparent lower barrier height and as a result, the ideality factors show an increase at low temperatures. However, the density of carriers will increase with increasing temperature, and the amount of lower barrier height patches is limited; so, carriers having sufficient energy begin to overcome the lower barrier height, as a result, the extracted barrier height increases. For the temperature dependent barrier height in the forward bias region, we have used the Richardson plot of the saturation current density, and Eq. (2) (supplementary material) can be rewritten as
Therefore, the plot of ln(J_{s}/T^{2}) vs 1/T shown in the inset of Fig. 7(a) should give a straight line and using the best linear region and the intercept of this curve will give the value of Richardson constant. In our measurements, the calculated value of A^{*} is ∼1.912 × 10^{−8 }A/cm^{2} K^{2}, which is much smaller than the Richardson constant for free electrons (120 A/cm^{2} K^{2}), indicating that the diffusion mechanism is dominating as expected.
The series resistance values at different temperatures are calculated using the Cheung relation, and their variation with temperature are shown in Fig. 7(b). Moreover, Fig. 7(b) also shows the response of saturation current density (J_{s}) as a function of temperature. The results reveal that the R_{s} value increases continuously up to very high value with decreasing temperature ∼7283 kΩ (at 150 K), and it becomes unable to calculate (utc) further at low temperatures. It is because at lower temperatures 125 K, 80 K and 10 K, the downward curvature region of the plot dV/d(lnJ) vs J is not able to fit by the straight line. Thus, the values of R_{s} are unable to calculate for these temperatures. Interestingly, it is observed that below 250 K, the forward current density increases and it may be attributed to the fact that freezing out of trap states or the tunneling mechanism is much more pronounced at lower temperatures. This is purely assigned that at 300 K, the value of J_{s} is quite high where shunt effects are already almost insignificant. On decreasing the temperature, J_{s} gets considerably reduced and is ascribed to the fact that the shunt resistance effect at low temperatures becomes significant. For temperatures less than 150 K, the value of J_{s} becomes extremely low and this is attributed to the freezing out of traps/surface states present in the hybrid diode. Furthermore, at lower temperatures, the reverse current also starts decreasing, which is attributed to the fact that the diffusion mechanism becomes weaker and the tunneling mechanism of carriers is enhanced [20,37].
In order to get further in-depth information about the dominant conduction mechanisms with varying temperature, we further analyzed forward J-V characteristics. The forward J-V characteristics of the hybrid diode at low temperatures exhibit three conduction path regions [Fig. 6(b)]. Normally, conduction in polymer based hybrid devices is assumed to arise by hole polarons [20]. Above 250 K, in the first region, the diode exhibits low mobility of charge carriers, and we expect that current transport of charge carriers at the junction follow the diffusion theory. In the second region, at a higher bias voltage, the conduction path corresponds to the two proposed possibilities of tunneling mechanisms, such as the polaron of P3OT is first excited to form a hole in the valence band and then holes tunnel to the inorganic semiconductor and lastly a hole leaves the polaron and tunnels directly from P3OT to the ZnO semiconductor. Thus, these three conduction mechanisms in different regions are expected to govern the transport of carriers in such hybrid diodes.
IV. CONCLUSION
In summary, a hybrid film of ZnO-P3OT polymer composite was fabricated on PS using ultrasonication cast technique for developing a Ag/ZnO:P3OT/PS/p-Si/Al hybrid heterojunction photodiode. The dark J-V characteristics of the diode exhibit very good rectification ratio and are observed to be ∼1.4×10^{4} at ±3 V with a forward current density of ∼68 mA/cm^{2} at 3 V. The hybrid diode showed good photodiode behavior under solar light illumination with a high photosensitivity of ∼4295 at around −1.7 V and behaved ideally in a forward bias including the high responsivity of ∼0.15 A/W at −3 V. The diode also exhibits very good responsivities of 1.04 A/W and 3.08 A/W for UV and green light, respectively. This diode shows noteworthy rise and recovery times as well. Also, a study of the temperature dependence of J-V characteristics has been carried out, and it shows that the ideality factor increases upon decreasing temperature. This is attributed to the tunneling current transport mechanism. The results further suggest that the barrier height increases with increasing temperature. The obtained results show that hybrid heterojunction diodes are beneficial to developing large-area, low cost and high quality hybrid photodiodes including photovoltaic devices for advanced future technology.

FIG. 1. 
(a) Schematic diagram of the hybrid device structure. (b) Absorption and photoluminescence spectra of the hybrid film.
FIG. 2. 
(a) Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the Ag/ZnO/P3OT/PS/p-Si/Al hybrid heterojunction diode under dark conditions and under solar light illumination in a ±3 V bias range. (b) The rectification ratio of the hybrid diode with respective ± bias voltages in the dark. Series resistance is calculated using the Cheung relation with plots of (c) dV/d (lnJ) vs J and (d) plot H(J) vs J whose slopes give the values of series resistance.
FIG. 3. 
(a) Photosensitivity variation of the hybrid photodiode as a function of bias voltage under solar light illumination. (b) The responsivity of the hybrid photodiode in reverse bias voltage.
FIG. 4. 
(a) Current vs time (I-t) measurement of the hybrid photodiode under UV (365 nm @ 100 μW/cm^{2}) and green light (520 nm @ 4.4 μW/cm^{2}) for the applied voltage of 1.7 V; while (b) and (c) show the rise and recovery time determination under UV illumination, respectively.
FIG. 5. 
(a) Schematic energy band diagram at equilibrium under zero bias and (b) under simulated solar light illumination in a reverse bias for the carrier transport of nc-ZnO/P3OT/PS/p-Si across interfaces.
FIG. 6. 
(a) Current density-voltage (J-V) characteristic of the hybrid diode in the temperature range from 300 K to 10 K. (b) Forward bias J-V characteristics of the hybrid diode in the same temperature range.
FIG. 7. 
(a) Temperature dependence of the ideality factor and the barrier height of the hybrid diode in the temperature range 10 K to 300 K. Inset shows the Richardson plot. (b) Variation of saturation current density and series resistance in the temperature range 10–300 K.
