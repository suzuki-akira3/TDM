Visible-blind and solar-blind detection induced by defects in AlGaN high electron mobility transistors
Visible- and solar-blind detection was demonstrated using Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}N/Al_{0.30}Ga_{0.70}N and Al_{0.85}Ga_{0.25}N/Al_{0.70}Ga_{0.30}N high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs), respectively. Peak responsivities (S) of 3.9 × 10^{6} A/W in the saturation mode and 6.2 × 10^{4} A/W in the pinch-off mode were observed for the visible-blind Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}N/Al_{0.30}Ga_{0.70}N HEMT, and a peak S of 4.9 × 10^{4} A/W was observed for the solar-blind Al_{0.85}Ga_{0.15}N/Al_{0.70}Ga_{0.30}N HEMT in the saturation mode. Spectrally resolved photocurrent investigation indicated that sub-bandgap absorption by defect states was the primary origin of the HEMTs' photoresponse. Defect-mediated responsivity caused slow photocurrent rise and fall times, but electrical pulsing was used to improve the bandwidth at the cost of optical gain. Operating HEMTs in this dynamic mode achieved a 25 Hz bandwidth with S = 2.9 × 10^{5} A/W in accumulation and S = 2.0 × 10^{4} A/W in pinch-off for visible-blind detection and S = 5.1 × 10^{3} A/W for solar-blind detection.
I. INTRODUCTION
Visible-blind and solar-blind photodetection is useful for a variety of applications. Visible-blind detectors enable indoor non-line-of-sight communication, and solar-blind detectors find use for flame detection, bio-chemical pathogen detection, and outdoor non-line-of-sight communication [1]. Avalanche-mode photodetectors, such as silicon avalanche photodiodes (APDs) or photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), are often used for visible- or solar-blind applications. However, these technologies have important shortcomings. Photomultiplier tubes operate at high voltage, and the attendant power supplies make them heavy and bulky. Silicon APDs can be challenging to the field because they require cooling to achieve high detectivity. Also, Si APDs require fragile and expensive optical filters to achieve a high visible rejection ratio (VRR) or a solar rejection ratio (SRR) because Si naturally absorbs in the visible and UV spectral regions. In general, APDs also suffer from the high dark count rate [1], which undercuts a photodetector's value in threat detection applications, such as bio-chemical or flame sensing, due to the potential for frequent false alarms.
A variety of other visible- and solar-blind detection technologies have been investigated to overcome these issues. Examples include SiC APDs [2] and AlGaN APDs [3–5], yet dark count rates remain >5 kHz. Non-avalanche approaches such as photodiodes based on InGaN quantum well detectors [6] and AlGaN [7,8],β-Ga_{2}O_{3} [9], and II-VI [10] materials have shown promise, but their optical responsivities remain low because it is difficult to realize large optical gain in these types of devices. GaN [11–14] and AlGaN [15–17] phototransistors are appealing for visible- and solar-blind applications, respectively, because they have the potential for low dark current, low dark count rate, fast temporal response, and high optical gain and can be made inherently visible- or solar-blind by tuning the (Al)GaN bandgap between 3.4 and 6.2 eV. However, achieving both large optical responsivity and fast temporal response in (Al)GaN phototransistors has been challenging. For example, responsivities of >10^{8} A/W have been demonstrated in GaN metal-semiconductor field effect transistor (MESFETs) [18] using 470 nm light to increase the drain current by exciting trapped carriers out of deep level defect states, yet the temporal response was so slow that the devices were not practical for photodetection. Recently, an AlGaN MESFET was shown to produce a solar-blind responsivity of >10^{6} A/W [15], but the operating bandwidth was not experimentally investigated. On the other hand, GaN- [11–14] and AlGaN-based [16,17] high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) have exhibited visible-blind and solar-blind photodetection with ms response times, yet their responsivities to monochromatic illumination were less than 10^{5} A/W.
Understanding the physical process giving rise to strong photosensitivity in AlGaN-based phototransistors will help to design devices that can achieve both high responsivity and high bandwidth. However, mechanisms for large optical gain in AlGaN transistors remain unclear. Optical gain in AlGaN MESFETs has been attributed to the capture of photo-generated free holes into defect states, giving rise to an increase in the steady-state electron density in the channel [15]. For (Al)GaN HEMTs, optical gain has been described as arising from free hole generation in the barrier layer, causing an enhancement of the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) [13] or collection of free carriers generated in the channel layer by the depletion region under the gate [16]. Additionally, sub-bandgap absorption by either the barrier or the channel layer has also been observed to produce strong thresholds in optical responsivity in (Al)GaN HEMTs [12,16], suggesting that deep level defects can have a role in the photoresponse. In this study, Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}N/Al_{0.30}Ga_{0.70}N and Al_{0.85}Ga_{0.70}N/Al_{0.75}Ga_{0.25}N HEMTs were used as high gain visible-blind and solar-blind photodetectors, respectively. Bias-dependent detection modes were investigated, and defects were determined to be the origin of high responsivity. This unambiguous demonstration of the mechanism for photodetection in these AlGaN photo-transistors is important because such an understanding enables rational design of future devices for improved performance. The defect-mediated temporal characteristics of the photocurrent were examined, and it was demonstrated that high responsivity can be achieved with a detection bandwidth sufficient for imaging applications.
II. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS
Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}N/Al_{0.30}Ga_{0.70}N and Al_{0.85}Ga_{0.70}N/Al_{0.75}Ga_{0.25}N HEMTs were grown by metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) in a Veeco D-125 system at 75 Torr using conventional precursors, including trimethylgallium (TMGa), trimethylaluminum (TMAl), and ammonia. The Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}N/Al_{0.30}Ga_{0.70}N HEMT was grown at 1050 °C on a 3.9 μm-thick, unintentionally doped (UID) Al_{0.30}Ga_{0.70}N epilayer upon a 1.6 μm-thick AlN template grown on (0001) c-plane sapphire substrates mis-oriented 0.2° toward the m-plane. The Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}N/Al_{0.30}Ga_{0.70}N HEMT had a buffer and channel thickness of 250 nm and a barrier thickness of 50 nm. The heterostructure had a sheet resistance (R_{sh}) of 3200 Ω/sq determined by contactless sheet resistance measurements. A two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) sheet density (n_{s}) of 4.5 × 10^{12} cm^{−2} was measured by Hg probe capacitance-voltage measurements, indicating a channel mobility (μ) of 430 cm^{2}/V s. This electron mobility compares well against previous Al_{0.30}Ga_{0.70}N channel heterostructures with μ = 265 cm^{2}/V s [19]. The Al_{0.85}Ga_{0.15}N/Al_{0.70}Ga_{0.30}N HEMT was grown at 1050 °C on a template consisting of 2.9 μm-thick AlN on c-plane sapphire mis-oriented 0.2° toward the m-plane. The Al_{0.85}Ga_{0.15}N/Al_{0.70}Ga_{0.30}N HEMT consisted of a 50 nm AlGaN layer linearly graded from AlN to the channel composition, with a channel thickness of 400 nm and a barrier thickness of 25 nm. The channel for the Al_{0.85}Ga_{0.15}N/Al_{0.70}Ga_{0.30}N HEMT had R_{sh} = 2500 Ω/sq, n_{s} = 8.0 × 10^{12} cm^{−2}, and μ = 310 cm^{2}/V s. The channel mobility for these transistors is similar to that of the recently reported Al_{0.85}Ga_{0.15}N/Al_{0.65}Ga_{0.35}N AlGaN HEMTs, μ = 284 cm^{2}/V s [20]. The threading dislocation density for both the Al_{0.30}Ga_{0.70}N and Al_{0.70}Ga_{0.30}N epilayers was in the range of 2–3 × 10^{9} cm^{−2}, as determined by x-ray diffraction. The contactless sheet resistance using a Lehighton 1510 measured sheet resistances >100 kΩ/sq for each, and Hg-probe capacitance-voltage measurements on similar UID-AlGaN indicated fully depleted layers.
Circular HEMT devices were fabricated for photocurrent measurements. The gate length was 2 μm, and the gate widths were 314 μm and 628 μm for the Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}N/Al_{0.30}Ga_{0.70}N and Al_{0.85}Ga_{0.15}N/Al_{0.70}Ga_{0.30}N HEMTs, respectively. The source-to-gate and gate-to-drain spacing was 4 μm. Ohmic contacts were formed by e-beam evaporation of a Ti/Al/Ni/Au stack and subsequent annealing up to 950 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere for the Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}N/Al_{0.30}Ga_{0.70}N HEMT and a Nb/Ti/Al/Mo/Au stack and subsequent annealing at up to 1000 °C for 30 s in a nitrogen atmosphere for the Al_{0.85}Ga_{0.15}N/Al_{0.70}Ga_{0.30}N HEMT. An optical micrograph of the device geometry can be found in Ref [21]. Circular transmission line measurements determined specific contact resistivities of 1 × 10^{−5} and 2 × 10^{−2} Ω cm^{2} for the Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}N/Al_{0.30}Ga_{0.70}N and Al_{0.85}Ga_{0.15}N/Al_{0.70}Ga_{0.30}N HEMTs, respectively. A Ni/Au stack was used for the Schottky gate, deposited into an opening in silicon nitride dielectric, defining the HEMT gate dimension. The gate metal overlaps the SiN_{x} opening by 1 μm, resulting in a field plate geometry normally intended to enhance breakdown voltage. The Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}N/Al_{0.30}Ga_{0.70}N HEMTs showed good uniformity over much of the ¼ of 2 in. wafers used for this study. The current density of the Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}N/Al_{0.30}Ga_{0.70}N and Al_{0.85}Ga_{0.15}N/Al_{0.70}Ga_{0.30}N devices had a standard deviation of 3% and 8%, respectively, over the regions that yielded the best devices.
Schottky barrier diodes, hereafter termed the Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}N/Al_{0.30}Ga_{0.70}N Schottky, were fabricated for steady-state photocapacitance (SSPC) measurements from another Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}N/Al_{0.30}Ga_{0.70}N wafer that was grown under nominally identical growth conditions as for the Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}N/Al_{0.30}Ga_{0.70}N HEMT. Semi-transparent Schottky contacts were formed by depositing Ni layers of 9 nm thickness with a 300 × 300 μm^{2} geometry. At this thickness, optical transmission is 99% for a photon energy (hν) of < 3.50 eV and 63% for hν > 4.00 eV [22]. Ti/Al/Ni/Au layers were deposited by e-beam evaporation on the Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}N surface and subsequently annealed at 850 °C for 30 s to form Ohmic contacts.
The photocurrent spectra of the HEMTs were measured to understand the influence of illumination on HEMT operation as a function of bias, and photocapacitance was measured to assess the role of defects in the photocurrent response. Photocurrent and photocapacitance measurements were performed at 297 K using a Xe arc lamp source filtered through a ¼ m monochromator with mode-sorting filters to achieve monochromatic illumination from 1.20 to 6.00 eV. The focused beam size was approximately 1 × 5 mm^{2} and overfilled the devices. For optical responsivity (S) measurements, i.e., the increase in drain current (I_{ds}) per incident optical power, the width of the monochromator entrance and exits slits was adjusted to maintain a uniform photon flux (ϕ) of 10^{16} cm^{−2} s^{−1} between hν = 1.20 and 4.60 eV. To examine the response to low intensity illumination, a calibrated neutral density filter was used to reduce the incident optical power ∼100×, producing an optical intensity of ∼60 μW/cm^{2} incident upon the HEMT between the source and drain. For hν = 4.60–6.00 eV, ϕ varied between 10^{15} and 10^{14} cm^{−2} s^{−1}, and the incident optical intensity was reduced by ∼6× to ∼60 μW/cm^{2} using a calibrated neutral density filter. Two Keithley 2400 source measurement units with their commons grounded to the source were used to apply gate and drain biases and to measure I_{ds} as a function of time. The SSPC of the Schottky diode was measured using a Boonton 7200B capacitance meter using the same optical system without neutral density filters. SSPC measures the change in gate capacitance (ΔC) relative to the equilibrium capacitance in the dark (C_{0}) due to an increase in space-charge following the photoemission of an electron from a deep level defect located in the depletion region under the gate [23]. An inflection point occurs in the SSPC spectrum when hν is just large enough to promote an electron to the conduction band. Thus, the qualitative shape of the SSPC spectrum provides information about the energetic location of defect levels in the bandgap.
III. VISIBLE-BLIND DEVICE RESULTS
A. Influence of bias on photodetection
Figure 1(a) shows the I_{ds}-V_{gs} characteristics of the Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}N/Al_{0.30}Ga_{0.70}N HEMT with and without illumination for V_{ds} = 5 V, which was just past the knee voltage and into the saturation mode at V_{gs} = +3 V. When operated in the dark, the Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}N/Al_{0.30}Ga_{0.70}N HEMT has an abrupt pinch-off at a threshold voltage (V_{th}) of −2.5 V with low source-to-drain leakage. The HEMT achieved a maximum I_{ds} of 70 mA/mm. Detailed discussion of the Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}N/Al_{0.30}Ga_{0.70}N HEMT electrical characterization is given elsewhere [21]. The I_{ds}-V_{gs} characteristics under illumination exhibit strong visible-blind photodetection. Illumination with 3.05 eV (405 nm) light produced very little change in I_{ds} at any bias, whereas 4.40 eV illumination produced a significant increase in I_{ds} in both pinch-off and saturation. Figure 1(b) shows the responsivity at 4.40 eV and dissipated dc power as a function of V_{gs}. Three modes of photodetector operation are evident from Fig. 1: saturation, pinch-off, and partial pinch-off. When the HEMT is biased in saturation (V_{gs} > −1 V), a large absolute increase in I_{ds} can be achieved, leading to a large S but coming at the cost of significant dissipated dc power current because I_{ds} is also large. When the HEMT is in the pinch-off mode (V_{gs} < −2.5 V), the dark current is very low, producing low power dissipation and a large relative increase in I_{ds}. However, the absolute change in I_{ds} is lower, and so, S will be lower as well. A similar observation has been made previously for GaN HEMT-based photodetectors, where the pinch-off operating condition was achieved using a p-GaN cap rather than electrical bias [12]. In the partial pinch-off regime (−2.5 V < V_{gs} < −1 V), S can be large, while the dc power is kept low.
Spectrally resolved photocurrent measurements were performed for the Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}N/Al_{0.30}Ga_{0.70}N HEMT to quantify S and the visible-rejection ratio for the saturation and partial pinch-off modes where large S can be achieved. Figure 2 presents the S spectrum for the HEMT biased at V_{gs} = +2 V and V_{ds} = 5 V, where S is defined as
where ΔI is the increase in drain current with illumination and A is the device area defined as the gate width multiplied by the source-to-drain spacing. It was observed that temporal response ΔI(t) had time constants that were strongly dependent on hν, where the photoresponse to infrared and visible illumination was much slower than for ultraviolet illumination. A measurement time was set to 1.6 s to characterize the infrared and visible responsivity of the detector. The influence of measurement time on the spectral response of S utility of the HEMTs as practical detectors is discussed below in Sec. III C.
The responsivity peaked at 3.9 × 10^{6} A/W for hν = 4.40 eV with a visible-blind rejection ratio (VBRR) of 3.1 × 10^{3}. Two sub-bandgap absorption bands starting at 3.05 eV and 3.85 eV were evident, and an additional increase in the photo-response was observed at the bandgap energy (E_{g}) of 4.10 eV (determined by SSPC, as described below). The majority of the total photo-response occurred for sub-bandgap absorption, which indicates that the optical generation of electron-hole pairs with above-bandgap light produced only a minor contribution to photocurrent gain. The S spectrum of the same device biased in partial pinch-off with V_{gs} = −2 V and V_{ds} = 5 V is shown in Fig. 3. The spectral response is qualitatively similar, except that sub-bandgap absorption is suppressed until 3.55 eV, the peak responsivity S = 6.2 × 10^{4} A/W, and the VBRR = 1.2 × 10^{4}. The blue-shift of the absorption tail at pinch-off is likely due to a decreased sensitivity to defects located near the channel as the depletion region extends farther into the underlying buffer [24]. The benefits and drawbacks of saturation and partial pinch-off mode operation can now be quantified. Operation in saturation delivers 60× larger peak responsivity but comes at the cost of a 4× reduction in VBRR relative to operation in partial pinch-off. Furthermore, the dc power dissipation is 2500× greater for the saturation (∼100 mW) compared to partial pinch-off (∼40 μW). Thus, a trade-off exists between maximizing responsivity, maximizing VBRR, and minimizing dc power dissipation that can be optimized for a given application.
B. Role of defects to produce photoresponse
The comparatively weak sensitivity of the Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}N/Al_{0.30}Ga_{0.70}N HEMT to above-bandgap optical excitation relative to sub-bandgap illumination raises the question as to the physical origin of the strong photocurrent response. The photovoltaic response of the Schottky gate to above bandgap illumination, shown in the inset of Fig. 1(b), indicates an external quantum efficiency of ∼10% at −10 V, whereas the photoresponse of the HEMT channel to sub-bandgap illumination indicates external quantum efficiency much greater than unity. Photocurrent response to sub-bandgap illumination is often attributed to photoemission of carriers from deep level defect states. For GaN HEMTs, in particular sub-bandgap absorption, i.e., deep level defect photoemission, can dramatically alter the electrostatics of the surface, barrier, and buffer regions, giving rise to a decrease (more negative shift) in V_{th} and attendant large ΔI [25]. A detailed review of these dynamics including energy band diagrams of deep level photoemission processes in GaN transistors is provided in Ref [25], and a similar effect is expected for AlGaN HEMTs. SSPC measurements were undertaken to examine the role of deep level defects in the responsivity of the Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}N/Al_{0.30}Ga_{0.70}N HEMT.
Figure 4 shows the SSPC spectrum of the Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}N/Al_{0.30}Ga_{0.70}N Schottky diode that presents strong evidence that the Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}N/Al_{0.30}Ga_{0.70}N HEMT responsivity results from defect absorption rather than band-to-band processes. The important spectral features are the major thresholds in the photocapacitance at 3.00 eV and 3.80 eV and the photocapacitance shoulder at 4.10 eV. The positive inflection points in the SSPC spectrum become more apparent in the differential SSPC spectrum in the inset of Fig. 4, and they indicate two defect states that begin to strongly absorb at hν = 3.00 eV and at hν = 3.80 eV. These energy thresholds for defect absorption coincide closely with the two absorption thresholds in the Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}N/Al_{0.30}Ga_{0.70}N HEMT responsivity spectrum for operation in the saturation mode. This observation supports the assignment of deep level defects as the source for the photoresponse of the Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}N/Al_{0.30}Ga_{0.70}N HEMT. The SSPC spectrum of Fig. 4 is characteristic of AlGaN. Previous photocapacitance studies of deep level defects as a function of Al the mole fraction [26,27] for AlGaN grown in the same MOVPE reactor used in this study also found two dominant defect states in the lower half of the bandgap. Based on those previous studies, the defect level closer to mid-bandgap was ascribed to being related to the group-III vacancy, while the defect level closer to the valence band could be related to substitutional impurities such as carbon or magnesium.
The shoulder at 4.10 eV in the SSPC spectrum demarcates E_{g} of the Al_{0.30}Ga_{0.70}N layer. Generally, a decrease in SSPC occurs at hν = E_{g} due to incident light having sufficient energy to stimulate band-to-band absorption, which generates electron-hole pairs rather than contributing to photocapacitance due to defect absorption. Referring to Figs. 2 and 3, S is already near its maximum value at hν = 4.10 eV, and so, optical electron-hole pair generation has a comparatively weak contribution to the photoresponse of the Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}N/Al_{0.30}Ga_{0.70}N HEMT. This observation reinforces the attribution of visible-blind responsivity to defect photoemission.
A simple estimate of the influence of optical electron-hole-pair creation on the photo-response of the Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}N/Al_{0.30}Ga_{0.70}N HEMT provides further support for the predominance of defect-mediated processes. Neither collection of photo-generated electron-hole-pairs nor the electrostatic influence of electron-hole-pairs can explain the large photo-response of the Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}N/Al_{0.30}Ga_{0.70}N HEMT in either saturation or partial pinch-off. An upper bound for the influence of free carrier generation can be estimated by assuming 100% photon absorption within the HEMT 300 nm barrier/channel/buffer active region and 100% carrier collection efficiency. In this case, the number of electron-hole pairs generated per second is ϕA to produce only ∼0.5 nA of current, which is well below the photocurrent observed at V_{gs} = −2 V or +3 V in Fig. 1. The steady-state areal density of photo-generated electron-hole pairs is also very small relative to the areal defect density. Assuming a generous non-radiation lifetime (τ_{nr}) of 10 ns compared to 45 ns for commercial GaN light emitting diodes [28] and ignoring any electron-hole-pair collection by the gate or drain electrodes, the areal electron-hole pair concentration in the HEMT is at most ϕτ_{nr} ∼1 × 10^{7} cm^{−2}. The areal defect density can be estimated as the 2DEG density multiplied by ΔI/I_{0} [29], which is ∼1.4 × 10^{12} cm^{−2}. Thus, the areal defect density is >10^{5} times larger than that of electron-hole-pairs, and so, the electrostatics of charges trapped at defects dominates those associated with optically generated free carriers.
The processes by which large responsivity arises in the Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}N/Al_{0.30}Ga_{0.70}N HEMTs for their different modes of operation are now considered in light of the importance of defects to the photoresponse of the Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}N/Al_{0.30}Ga_{0.70}N HEMT. In saturation, defect photoemission increases the space-charge in the depleted barrier or buffer regions, and I_{ds} increases because the more positively charged defects reduce the surface and/or barrier potentials. These space-charge and I_{ds} adjustments comport with the decrease in V_{th} of ∼0.5 V under 4.40 eV illumination seen in Fig. 1. However, the on/off ratio for hν = 4.40 eV illumination is > 100× smaller relative to dark operation. This photo-generated I_{ds} “leakage” current does not pinch off for V_{gs} up to −4 V. In this case, a possible explanation for the large relative increase in I_{ds} for partial pinch-off operation is that photoemission from defects located in the Al_{0.30}Ga_{0.70}N buffer causes the buffer to transition from a highly resistive (∼30 nA/mm) to a weakly conductive (∼30 μA/mm) state. It is interesting to note that the similarities between the S and SSPC spectra indicate that the defects producing large responsivity in the Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}N/Al_{0.30}Ga_{0.70}N HEMT are not associated with the Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}N barrier surface. This conclusion follows from the sensitivity of SSPC to defects in the depletion region under the Schottky metal, which excludes defects related to the semiconductor surface.
C. Dynamic performance of defect-mediated photodetection
The temporal response of defect-induced responsivity can be a concern. The optical emission rate of a defect is proportional to ϕ, which is typically very low for applications involving UV emitters, resulting in a potentially slow rise time. Furthermore, the decay time constant is also typically long because the defects that induce an increase in HEMT I_{ds} are located in depleted regions, where it is hard to capture carriers and return to the initial (dark) state. Such slow rise and fall times for the photocurrent limit the detector bandwidth, and so, it is important to examine these issues directly to assess the technological utility of these HEMTs as photodetectors. The insets of Figs. 2 and 3 show the time-resolved response of the Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}N/Al_{0.30}Ga_{0.70}N HEMT to 4.40 eV illumination for an optical intensity of ∼60 μW/cm^{2} and operation in the saturation and partial pinch-off regimes, respectively. For both cases, the rise time constant is on the order of 50 ms and fall times are on the order of several seconds. Such slow decay times are not useful for most applications, and so, a method of device operation to achieve a higher bandwidth was evaluated.
The faster decay time was achieved by applying an electrical fill pulse of V_{gs} = +3 V and V_{ds} = 15 V following illumination to repopulate defects by hot carrier escape from the channel into the barrier and/or buffer [25]. The duration of the fill pulses was ∼200 ms. The fill pulses were applied manually, and so, there was some variation in total duration. The rapid reduction of I_{ds} prepared the device for another detection event; however, I_{ds} was not fully reset to its dark value. Thus, the responsivity of the Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}N/Al_{0.30}Ga_{0.70}N HEMT was reduced when using an electrical fill pulse to increase the detection bandwidth. The dynamic S when using an electrical fill pulse was quantified with a least-squares fit of the rise time characteristics with a bi-exponential function. The fits are shown in the insets of Figs. 2 and 3 as solid lines. The shorter fitted time constant was 45 ms and 60 ms for saturation and pinch-off operation, respectively. The increase in I_{ds} at t = 40 ms after the beginning of illumination was taken from the transients to determine S at 25 Hz detection that is useful for imaging. The dynamic S at 25 Hz for 4.40 eV illumination was 2.9 × 10^{5} A/W in saturation and 1.6 × 10^{4} A/W in partial pinch-off for the Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}N/Al_{0.30}Ga_{0.70}N HEMT. Choosing a 40 ms time window significantly reduced S because it allowed the photocurrent only one time constant of rise time, but this restriction enables quantitative assessment of the technological usefulness of the Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}N/Al_{0.30}Ga_{0.70}N HEMT as a detector.
Figure 5 shows the spectrally resolved photoresponse of the Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}N/Al_{0.30}Ga_{0.70}N HEMT in partial pinch-off but using a shorter measurement time of 40 ms for the photocurrent rise and using V_{gs} = +3 V, V_{ds} = 15 V, and a fill pulse of 2 ms duration to reset the device after illumination at each photon energy. Reducing the measurement time to increase the operation bandwidth to 25 Hz resulted in the expected reduction of peak S = 2.0 × 10^{4} A/W and produced a blue shift in the absorption edge to 4.00 eV for the Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}N/Al_{0.30}Ga_{0.70}N HEMT relative to the spectrum in Fig. 3 with a 1 s measurement time. The shift in absorption was due to reduced sensitivity to the defect levels absorbing at hv < 4.00 eV, which produced photocurrent transients with time constants significantly longer than 40 ms.
The responsivity under partial pinch-off conditions is comparable to the previous report by Iwaya et_al [12] for a p-GaN/Al_{0.21}Ga_{0.79}N/GaN HEMT photodetector that was operated in pinch-off by way of the p-GaN layer acting as a floating gate that depleted the 2DEG below. Iwaya et_al achieved visible-blind detection under monochromatic illumination with S = 4 × 10^{4} A/W when considering only the area of the optical gate, which corresponds to S = 1 × 10^{4} A/W using the convention of this study to consider the entire device area between the source and drain. The responsivity spectrum for the p-GaN/Al_{0.21}Ga_{0.79}N/GaN HEMT in Ref [12] also suggests that photocurrent originates from sub-bandgap absorption by defects, similar to the Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}N/Al_{0.30}Ga_{0.70}N HEMT. The HEMT in Ref [12] had a single abrupt optical absorption threshold at 3.2 eV, which is consistent with the energy level of the Mg acceptor dopant relative to the conduction band, and its responsivity saturated at the GaN band edge of 3.40 eV, which indicated little contribution to S by electron-hole pair generation. However, the visible-blind HEMT photodetector in Ref [12] had a larger VBRR of 5800, a larger effective bandwidth of ∼200 Hz, and much sharper spectral transition from visible rejection to peak S compared to the Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}N/Al_{0.30}Ga_{0.70}N HEMT in this study. Faster temporal response and improved visible rejection can be explained by photocurrent generated by a defect level energetically located near an energy band edge, such as the p-type Mg dopant in GaN. Defect levels near an energy band edge typically have much larger optical cross-sections for absorption than mid-bandgap levels [30], i.e., faster photocurrent rise times, and a thermal re-capture of an electron into a photo-neutralized Mg acceptor level near the valence band can happen very quickly in an n-type semiconductor at room temperature, leading to fast decay times.
IV. SOLAR-BLIND DEVICE PERFORMANCE
Increasing the Al composition in III-Nitride HEMTs can shift the detection range from visible-blind to solar-blind. Yoshikawa et_al [17] demonstrated this by transitioning from a p-GaN/Al_{0.21}Ga_{0.79}N/GaN HEMT to a p-GaN/Al_{0.6}Ga_{0.4}N/Al_{0.5}Ga_{0.5}N HEMT. We achieved solar-blind detection by transitioning from the Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}N/Al_{0.30}Ga_{0.70}N HEMT to the Al_{0.85}Ga_{0.15}N/Al_{0.70}Ga_{0.30}N HEMT. Figure 6 shows the transfer characteristics for V_{ds} = 5 V of the Al_{0.85}Ga_{0.15}N/Al_{0.70}Ga_{0.30}N HEMT in the dark and under illumination. There was effectively no photocurrent generated for hν < 4.40 eV, indicating good solar-blind rejection for any bias condition, and substantial photocurrent was generated only with the device biased into saturation. Figure 7 shows the S spectrum for the Al_{0.85}Ga_{0.15}N/Al_{0.70}Ga_{0.30}N HEMT for V_{gs} = +3 V and V_{ds} = 5 V and with an intensity of ∼20 μW/cm^{2} between the source and drain measured with the device biased in saturation. The responsivity spectrum of the Al_{0.85}Ga_{0.15}N/Al_{0.70}Ga_{0.30}N HEMT shows sub-bandgap absorption beginning at 4.50 eV, an abrupt increase at 4.90 eV, and a plateau at Al_{0.70}Ga_{0.30}N E_{g} = 5.10 eV. A recent SSPC study of n-type Al_{0.70}Ga_{0.30}N epilayers grown in the same reactor as this HEMT observed a deep level defect at 0.15 eV above the valence band [27], and so, it is concluded that deep level defects were the main contributor to the photocurrent for the Al_{0.85}Ga_{0.15}N/Al_{0.70}Ga_{0.30}N HEMT similar to case for the Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}N/Al_{0.30}Ga_{0.70}N HEMT. The second step in the S spectrum occurring at 5.45 eV, which is near E_{g} for the Al_{0.85}Ga_{0.15}N layer, suggests that band-to-band absorption in the barrier did produce an additional contribution to HEMT photoresponse. The Al_{0.85}Ga_{0.15}N/Al_{0.70}Ga_{0.30}N HEMT exhibited a peak S of 4.9 × 10^{4} A/W and a solar-blind rejection ratio (SBRR) of ∼500.
The inset in Fig. 7 shows the temporal response at hν = 5.10 eV illumination, where a +3 V_{gs}, 15 V V_{ds} electrical fill pulse was again used to reset the HEMT following illumination. A least-squares fit to a bi-exponential was used to quantify the rise time of the photocurrent, which is shown as the solid line in the inset of Fig. 7. The increase in I_{ds} after 40 ms of illumination corresponded to S = 5.1 × 10^{3} A/W for an operating bandwidth of 25 Hz. This compares favorably to the work of Yoshikawa et_al [17] which demonstrated a solar-blind peak S = 3 × 10^{3} A/W at 4.96 eV illumination using a device type [12] that has demonstrated an effect bandwidth of ∼200 Hz when considering only the area of the optical gate, which corresponds to S = 7.5 × 10^{2} A/W using the convention of this study to consider the entire device area between the source and drain. The SBRR was significantly larger at 10^{4}, and the dark current was significantly lower at 50 pA for the p-GaN/Al_{0.6}Ga_{0.4}N/Al_{0.5}Ga_{0.5}N HEMT [17] compared to the Al_{0.85}Ga_{0.15}N/Al_{0.70}Ga_{0.30}N HEMT discussed here. The work of Muhtadi et_al [15] employed an Al_{0.5}Ga_{0.5}N metal-semiconductor field effect transistor to achieve a very high solar-blind peak S = 1.2 × 10^{6} A/W under broad-band UV excitation with an SBRR of ∼150; however, the lack of temporal characterization of the device means that its bandwidth was not determined experimentally.
V. IMPLICATIONS OF DEFECT-MEDIATED PHOTODETECTION ON DETECTOR PERFORMANCE
Sections III B and III C, respectively, explain how defects can produce large responsivity and useful bandwidth for HEMT-based photodetectors; however, defect-mediated photodetection could present potential complications in device operation. Detector non-linearity could certainly be a concern, especially as a function of bias. For the case of operation in saturation where V_{ds} is not far from the knee voltage, the photocurrent is expected to be linear with respect to incident optical power due to the linearity of drain current and 2DEG density. A similar result was found for GaN MESFETs [31]. When operated in partial pinch-off, the photocurrent might not be proportional to the incident optical power because the transconductance is not flat. In this case, application-specific calibration might be required to achieve the desired device operation. Defect-mediated photodetection will also limit the dynamic range and maximum photocurrent when the incident optical power is sufficient to saturate the defects in the device. Thus, such devices are best suited for detection of low power signals. Solar-blind detection is such an application due to the low output power of solid-state UV-C sources and strong atmospheric absorption of UV-C light. The incident power at which the photocurrent saturated was not determined for these devices, but the devices were observed to be saturated at 10 mW/cm^{2} of excitation.
Device reliability could also be a concern for defect-mediated photodetection due to inter-device variability, temperature sensitivity, and long-term instability. Responsivity was similar for devices in the same neighborhood on the wafers in this study. The inter-wafer variation in defect density could certainly lead the variation in device performance, but defect incorporation could be controlled, monitored, and even engineered in a production environment. The photoresponse of defect levels is dictated by their occupancy, which, in general, is a function of temperature. The effect of temperature was not examined, but it is not expected to have an impact on defect occupancy or device operation. The operative defect levels in study are much deeper than 1 eV below the conduction band, and so, they are expected to be stable at room temperature with thermal emission rates on the order of hours to days. The character or density of operative defects is not expected to change significantly over time. The devices operate at low voltage, low current, and low power, and so, defect creation due to electrical stress is not likely. Surface exposure to ambient or chemicals is also not expected to have a large effect on the device operation because the operative defects are likely related to the bulk and not the surface. This follows from the similarity between Schottky diode steady-state photocapacitance and transistor photocurrent.
VI. SUMMARY
In summary, visible- and solar-blind detection was demonstrated using Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}N/Al_{0.30}Ga_{0.70}N and Al_{0.85}Ga_{0.25}N/Al_{0.70}Ga_{0.30}N HEMTs, respectively. Peak S = 3.9 × 10^{6} A/W in the saturation mode and 6.2 × 10^{4} A/W in the partial pinch-off mode were observed for the visible-blind Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55 }N/Al_{0.30}Ga_{0.70}N HEMT, and a peak S = 4.9 × 10^{4} A/W was observed for the solar-blind Al_{0.85}Ga_{0.15}N/Al_{0.70}Ga_{0.30}N HEMT. Sub-bandgap absorption by defect states in the channel layer was found to be the primary origin to the HEMTs' photoresponse. Defect-mediated responsivity caused slow rise and fall times of the photocurrent for both HEMT types, but an electrical fill pulse was used to quickly reset HEMTs following illumination. Operating HEMTs in this dynamic mode indicates that the devices can achieve 25 Hz bandwidth with S = 2.9 × 10^{5} A/W in accumulation and S = 2.0 × 10^{4} A/W in partial pinch-off for visible-blind detection and S = 5.1 × 10^{3} A/W for solar-blind detection in accumulation.

After measuring the photoresponse at each photon energy, a 2 ms electrical fill pulse of +3 V V_{gs}, +15 V V_{ds} was used to quench the photocurrent. The shorter measurement time reduced the peak S relative to the spectrum in Fig. 3 and also increased the energy of the absorption edge due to the reduced sensitivity to slower photocurrent transients for hν < 4.00 eV.
