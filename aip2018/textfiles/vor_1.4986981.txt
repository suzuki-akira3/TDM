Synthesis of paramelaconite nanoparticles by laser ablation
Paramelaconite nanoparticles have been obtained by laser ablation from a copper target in propanol. Copper oxide nanoparticles were characterized by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. HR-TEM images demonstrated particle size in the range of 60–70 nm. It is observed that nanoparticle size depends on the wavelength and intensity of the laser. The results show that the stability of paramelaconite is affected by the high temperatures and oxidizing atmosphere, leading to a mixed phase of tenorite and paramelaconite.
I. INTRODUCTION
The application of laser irradiation to ablate materials from a target was first reported in early 1960s when the ruby lasers became available. Soon after, the pulsed laser ablation (PLA) technique of solid materials was developed. PLA has attracted intense attention because of its great potential in laser-based materials processing, including thin solid film preparation, nanocrystal growth, surface cleaning, and microelectronic device fabrication [1]. Nanoparticles present completely new and improved properties based on specific characteristics such as size, distribution, and morphology, which combine characteristics from both individual atoms/molecules and bulk solids [2,3].
Chemical methods for producing metallic nanoparticles are well known. However, application prospects might be restricted due to possible impurities resulting from the use of surfactants, chemical precursors, or reducing agents, which are difficult to separate from the precursor liquid solutions [4]. Laser ablation of solids contained in liquids is basically free from this limitation, because nanoparticles in this case are produced by the interaction of the high energy laser beam with the molten layer of the target surface [5]. Compared to laser ablation under vacuum conditions or in an inert atmosphere, the experimental setup for a laser ablation in a liquid environment is relatively simple. A solid target is placed in a confining liquid and it is exposed to laser radiation through the medium. Due to irradiation of the solid surface, the material is removed quickly and confined to the laser spot. The nanoparticles are ejected and remain in the liquid that surrounds the target, resulting in the formation of the colloidal solution [6]. In this process, irradiance is an important parameter that has strong influence on the amount of ablated mass and the particle size distribution. According to laser irradiance and the sample material, mass removal can occur through desorption, thermal evaporation, surface instability of molten mass, exfoliation, phase explosion, and other mechanisms. In a low irradiance region (<3 × 10^{8 }W/cm^{2}), desorption and thermal evaporation may dominate sample removal processes [7]. Numerous papers have been published which report on the formation of metal nanoparticles under laser ablation from corresponding bulk metals in liquids. Today, nanoparticles are widely implemented as functional elements in plastics, lacquers, and ceramic products. Novel applications are targeted on nanomedicine, sensing, electronics, optics, and biophotonics [4,8,9].
Copper is an important material due to its high electrical and thermal conductivity, in general, it is very reactive, and laser ablation of a metallic copper target in deionized water leads to the formation of copper oxide [10]. Copper forms two stable oxides, covalent CuO (monoclinic), and highly symmetric Cu_{2}O (cubic) [11], which are known as p-type semiconductors exhibiting band gaps of 1.2 and 2.2 eV, respectively. These copper oxides have been widely studied because of their solar-thermal conversion performances [12], photoelectrochemical properties [13], or their catalytic application [14]. However, this binary system also contains other oxides such as Cu_{3}O_{2} (Ref [15]) or Cu_{4}O_{3} (paramelaconite) [16]. Paramelaconite is a mineral that shows puzzling magnetic properties. Although it was discovered in mineral condition, pure Cu_{4}O_{3} has hardly been synthesized in bulk or nanoparticle form. First, Long and Petford [17] showed that microscopic quantities of Cu_{4}O_{3} are produced on decomposition of CuO in the beam of an electron microscope. In a typical synthesis process, copper foils are heated in the range of 200–1050 °C. It was noted that, in the temperature range of 1040–1050 °C, only one phase, cuprous oxide, existed, while in the temperature range of 200–950 °C, a mixture of cuprous and cupric oxide is observed [18]. The magnetic properties of a single crystal of paramelaconite Cu_{4}O_{3} have been reported to exhibit antiferromagnetic transition at low temperatures [19]. However, a conventional method for producing paramelaconite nanoparticles using laser ablation has not been reported, because paramelaconite is a metastable form and CuO or Cu_{2}O are more stable in bulk [7]. In this work, we report the synthesis of 6CuO·Cu_{2}O paramelaconite phase by laser ablation of a copper target immersed in propanol.
II. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS
The ablation of the copper target was carried out using a neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet laser with 680 mJ of output energy at a wavelength of 1064 nm, 5 ns pulse width, and repetition rate of 10 Hz. Colloidal copper particles were prepared by pulsed laser ablation of a bulk copper (99.99%) target. The solid sample was placed into a container filled with propanol, which was located on a stand 36 cm away from laser, as shown in Fig. 1. The samples were synthesized varying the ablation time and laser fluence and the conditions are displayed in Table I. The samples were labeled according to synthesis conditions (see Table I). The laser has a maximum energy of 680 mJ with the fluence of 1.07 J cm^{−2}; due to effects of the glass container and propanol, energy decays in average around 3%. The fluence values presented in the Table I take into account the aforementioned energy loss.
An ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometer was used to obtain the optical absorption spectra. The size distribution of the particles was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
Figure 2(a) shows the optical absorbance spectra of the colloidal copper solutions synthesized for 1 min at different laser fluence. The samples processed exhibited a weak plasmon resonance at 590 nm, approximately. It would be expected for the Cu-1–100 sample, performed at 1.04 J cm^{−2}, to have better definition of the absorption signal; however, the sample synthetized at 0.95 J cm^{−2} (Cu-1-90 sample) presented a well-defined peak, centered at 590 nm. The optical absorption spectra of samples obtained at 1.04 J cm^{−2} for different ablation times are shown in Fig. 2(b). The Cu-5-100 sample showed a very well defined plasmon resonance, with an absorption maximum at 587 nm. Pure Cu nanoparticles have a maximum absorption reported at 573 nm (Ref [20]) and, in general, the maximum could be between 540 and 640 nm [7].
Figure 3(a) presents a high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) image of the Cu-5-100 sample. Nanometer-sized copper particles with a spherical shape and surrounded possibly by organic material from propanol are observed. Figure 3(b) shows the transmission electron diffraction pattern of Cu-5-100 sample. From electron diffraction measurements, interplanar distance (d) was determined. The Cu-5-100 sample has a d of 2.66 Å; this result corresponds to 6CuO·Cu_{2}O phase and the diffraction plane is (202). The interplanar distance and the diffraction plane were identified using the powder diffraction files (PDF) #03-0879.
Figure 3(c) shows a HR-TEM image of the Cu-5-100 sample, which was used to determinate the interplanar distance and compare the result obtained from the electron diffraction pattern, a value of d = 2.034 Å was estimated, which corresponds to tetragonal paramelaconite phase (6CuO·Cu_{2}O), assigned to the diffraction plane (213) (PDF #03-0879). All the HR-TEM images analyzed exhibited an interplanar distance characteristic for paramelaconite phase (6CuO·Cu_{2}O). TEM images were analyzed to estimate the particles size with a Gaussian fit, and the average diameter calculated is between 60 and 70 nm (see Fig. 4). These particle sizes are in the order of those obtained by other authors [5,6,10,18].
In order to verify the crystalline structure of nanoparticles produced by laser ablation, X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed for an aliquot sample of the colloidal solution. Figure 5 shows the XRD patterns of samples obtained at 1.04 J cm^{−2}, the powder from Cu-1-100 sample was not enough to perform the measurement. The Cu-5-100 sample has two diffraction peaks belonging to the planes (112) of paramelaconite phase and (111) of CuO single phase (tenorite phase). The sample obtained at 3 min has one peak corresponding to the plane (112) of paramelaconite phase (6CuO·Cu_{2}O).
To compare the effect of laser wavelength on properties of nanoparticles obtained by laser ablation, the ablation of copper was performed at 532 nm in propanol using 0.892 J cm^{−2} and varying time from 1 to 5 min. Figure 6(a) shows a HR-TEM image of sample synthetized at 5 min, which reveals nanometer-sized copper particles and the analysis of the images showed an average size between 10 and 12 nm. This sample showed a high instability and the colloidal solutions sedimented at the end of the day. The interplanar distance was calculated from the electron diffraction pattern and HR-TEM images [see Figs. 6(b) and 6(c)]. Diffraction pattern revealed a d value of 2.07 Å, which corresponds to paramelaconite phase 6CuO·Cu_{2}O and the diffraction plane (213). The d value calculated from HR-TEM [Fig. 6(c)] was d = 3.16 Å, which is related to paramelaconite phase and the diffraction plane (112).
IV. CONCLUSIONS
Colloidal nanoparticles of copper oxide have been produced by laser ablation from a copper target in propanol at 1064 and 532 nm. The colloidal solution obtained at 1064 nm is very stable, while the nanoparticles obtained at 532 nm sediment in less than 24 h. Nanoparticles are spherical according with TEM images and have a size between 60 and 70 nm. According to the structural characterization, paramelaconite (6CuO·Cu_{2}O) phase can be produced in nanoparticles due to the high temperatures that the interaction between the laser and copper target produces by laser ablation, it is important to mention that paramelaconite is unstable as a bulk solid.
