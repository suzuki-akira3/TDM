Plasma parameters of the cathode spot explosive electron emission cell obtained from the model of liquid-metal jet tearing and electrical explosion
A model has been developed for the explosive electron emission cell pulse of a vacuum discharge cathode spot that describes the ignition and extinction of the explosive pulse. The pulse is initiated due to hydrodynamic tearing of a liquid-metal jet which propagates from the preceding cell crater boundary and draws the ion current from the plasma produced by the preceding explosion. Once the jet neck has been resistively heated to a critical temperature (∼1 eV), the plasma starts expanding and decreasing in density, which corresponds to the extinction phase. Numerical and analytical solutions have been obtained that describe both the time behavior of the pulse plasma parameters and their average values. For the cell plasma, the momentum per transferred charge has been estimated to be some tens of g cm/(s C), which is consistent with the known measurements of ion velocity, ion erosion rate, and specific recoil force. This supports the model of the pressure-gradient-driven plasma acceleration mechanism for the explosive cathode spot cells. The ohmic electric field within the explosive current-carrying plasma has been estimated to be some tens of kV/cm, which is consistent with the known experimental data on cathode potential fall and explosive cell plasma size. This supports the model that assumes the ohmic nature of the cathode potential fall in a vacuum discharge.
I. INTRODUCTION
A vacuum discharge develops in the current-carrying plasma formed from the electrode material due to the operation of cathode spots that emit electrons and plasma [1,2]. The essential features of the operation of vacuum discharge cathode spots are determined by the pulsed processes of explosive electron emission (EEE) [1–4]. Fast (ns) micrometer-size splashes of dense plasma occurring at the cathode spot due to electrical explosions produce large electron emission pulses named ectons. They are readily initiated at the surface contaminants or microirregularities and result in the formation of microcraters on the surface, plasma expansion from the cathode at a velocity of about 10^{6} cm/s, and liquid metal splashing from EEE cells at a velocity of about 10^{4} cm/s. The parameters of these pulsed processes determine the features of the cathode spot operation, thus being of considerable scientific interest.
Positive feedback between intense electron emission and resistive heating of microvolume is an essential feature of EEE processes resulting in electrical explosion. Pulse-periodic initiation of these pulses under the action of external plasma—including that remaining after preceding explosions provides operation of the cathode spots.
Recently, many detailed models have been developed in the context of the ecton theory that describes various properties of the EEE pulse generated by the cathode spot of a vacuum discharge. In particular, the ignition of an EEE pulse under the external plasma and power load was investigated [5–10], and the expansion of a cathode plasma flare was analyzed [11–14].
It was found that for an EEE pulse to be initiated at a “clean” surface, the energy flux must exceed a threshold of about 10^{8} W/cm^{2} (Refs [6–8]) and that easily eroding surface layers may substantially reduce the threshold [9,10]. The production of highly charged ions during a continuous metal-to-plasma transition and their acceleration in an expanding cathode plasma flare were described by the detailed numerical modeling [12–14].
Nevertheless, several fundamental questions still remain unanswered. In particular, why are the velocities of the ions emitted by cathode spot EEE-cells almost constant, varying weakly from about 5 to 20 km/s for all the elements irrespective of the conditions? What determines the cathode potential fall (correlating with cohesive energy) and the threshold current for an EEE cell?
Most of the approaches, in spite of their consistency and detailed results, require setting some external parameters, such as total current or its rise rate, potential, or external energy flux.
It is worth noting that all the parameters of a local EEE cell vary strongly and quickly in a cyclical manner. Furthermore, for a high current, a large number of cells operate simultaneously, resembling the process of boiling that intensifies due to intense evacuation of the matter above the surface. In this case, the EEE cells apparently interact, in particular, due to their “retrograde motion” in the magnetic field [14–16].
An adequate interpretation of the observations calls for a self-consistent model of a single EEE-cell pulse.
Typically, most of the approaches used for EEE pulse modeling consider either the ignition phase (ignition of an EEE center due to intensifying in the energy release) or the extinction phase (burning of the EEE center with decreasing energy release). Therefore, in particular, the time dependence of the emission current consistent with plasma formation dynamics throughout the EEE-cell pulse still remains unknown.
The aim of this work was to construct a simple but comprehensive model which would describe both of these phases.
The model implies taking into account the following phenomena: Joule electrical explosion, liquid-metal hydrodynamics, EEE pulse ignition by plasma action, matter properties under electrical explosion, and plasma acceleration that being combined in one consistent picture.
This makes it possible to obtain time dependences of the EEE pulse parameters and estimate their values averaged over the pulse that could be compared with the experimental observations.
II. ESTIMATIONS OF PLASMA PARAMETERS FROM AN AVERAGE CRITICAL STATE MODEL
Let us first estimate the basic parameters of the EEE plasma. Recently, a model has been proposed that takes into account the critical state of matter (where density ∼10^{22} cm^{−3} and temperature ∼1 eV, and cohesive energy vanishes) and the acceleration of the explosively generated plasma to describe the basic average characteristics of an EEE cell [17]. As was found by Tanberg [18], (i) there exists a specific recoil force that accelerates the cathode spot plasma and (ii) this force increases nearly linearly with the arc current: F/I ≈ ϑ (specific force ϑ was measured to be a few tens of dyne/A). For ϑ, a formula was proposed, ϑ = ½ v_{i} γ_{i}, where v_{i} is the velocity of ions (plasma) ejected from the cathode spot explosive cell and γ_{i} is the specific erosion rate (both are known from measurements) [19]. In the context of the ecton model [3], the specific recoil force can be attributed to the EEE-plasma momentum per transferred charge. Assuming that the state of the material during the explosion is nearly critical, we can estimate an average current density at the EEE cell j_{c} that corresponds to an average critical pressure, P_{cr}, as [17]
Formula (1) gives j_{c} of about 100 MA/cm^{2} for the majority of materials (Table I). We can make certain that this value is not over the thermal plasma current density by using the formula
which gives 270 MA/cm^{2} for the typical EEE plasma temperature and density, n = 10^{20} cm^{−3} and T_{e} = 1 eV [20–22].
Let us estimate the plasma parameters using this model. The ion current fraction in the accelerated plasma flare of a vacuum arc makes about 1/10 of the total arc current reaching the anode: I_{e} − I_{i}, namely, I_{i}/(I_{e} − I_{i})= α_{i} ∼ 0.1 [23,24]. The ion (plasma) velocity toward the anode, v_{i}, is known to be ∼10^{6} cm/s [18,25]. As the ion and electron space-charge densities are nearly equal, n_{e} ≈ Z n_{i}, we can estimate the electron drift velocity, v_{e}, from the relation
which gives v_{e} ∼ 10 v_{i} and v_{e} ∼ 10^{7} cm/s; this is close to the thermal drift velocity v_{1}_{th} = (T_{e}/2πm_{e})^{1/2} that is about 1.7 × 10^{7} cm/s for T_{e} = 1 eV. If v_{e} is greater than v_{1}_{th}, fast electrostatic two-stream (Buneman) instability may arise [26]. It can be verified that the electron drift velocity v_{e} ≈ v_{i}/α_{i} [see Eq. (3)] is close to (T_{cr}/2πm_{e})^{1/2} (see Table I).
The plasma density can be derived from (1) and (3) as
As can be seen from Table I, the plasma density determined by Eq. (4) is in the range (0.4–2.8) × 10^{20} cm^{−3} for the materials having both high and low T_{cr}. For such a plasma, the Debye length and field
are about 10^{−7 }cm and 10^{7} V/cm, respectively. Hence, for a plasma of density n = 10^{20} cm^{−3} at T_{e} = T_{cr} = 1 eV (corresponding to 11 594 K), we have L_{D} = 0.743 nm and E_{D} = 1.35 V/nm.
Thus, the average critical state model predicts the average basic EEE-plasma parameters that agree with the known values, and we can use it for general estimations for various materials.
III. LIQUID-METAL JET TEARING MODEL
The EEE pulse generally proceeds in two phases: the ignition (with increasing energy release) and the extinction (with plasma outward acceleration). Let us consider a simplified model of an exploding liquid-metal jet, which nevertheless takes into account both of the phases (Fig. 1), and let us treat the explosion per se as a transition through a critical state in accordance with the results of Sec. II and Refs [17] and  [28].
Recall that the liquid-metal jet electrical explosion is thought to be responsible for the sustainment of cathode spot explosive cells on a “clean” surface [1–4,19,29–31]. High EEE-plasma pressure extrudes the liquid metal from the crater. The melt splits into jets (emitting droplets) that, interacting with the remaining plasma, electrically explode by the current flowing through the jet (see Fig. 1).
Recently, many studies have been performed on EEE-cell liquid-metal hydrodynamics [32–36]. In particular, the formation of a liquid-metal crater with a fine rim was numerically simulated [32]. The latter model has an advantage over the previous one [37,38] in that it operates on a larger time scale, covering a substantial extrusion of the liquid metal from the crater and the formation of a fine liquid-metal rim.
It was found that the rim splits into jets due to Rayleigh–Taylor and Rayleigh–Plateau instabilities [39,40] [with short wavelengths (below μm) stabilized by surface tension [41]].
It is worth noting that a detailed modeling of the liquid-metal hydrodynamics performed in Refs [32–36] requires specifying both the spatial and the time dependence of the incident plasma flux. This obviously defines whether the consequent explosion of the liquid-metal microprotrusion arises or it being burned out by intense plasma load that has been indicated in Ref [34].
In addition, theoretical works on instabilities [39,40] imply (phenomenologically) conservation of the explosive plasma momentum.
Recall that this study was to construct a model which would make it possible to estimate both the time behavior of the explosive plasma parameters (e.g., momentum) and their average values.
The current density in a propagating liquid-metal jet increases for geometric reasons (see second item in Fig. 1). It should be noted that, in addition to the previous models [30,31], our approach takes into account that (i) for an extending and tearing liquid-metal jet, the current density geometrical enhancement intensifies with time and (ii) in the ignition phase, the initial current density may be low as the current is transferred mostly by ions. The jet tearing leads to rather high current densities, even if the explosion has occurred at a low initial current density.
It was found that during the EEE initiation under intense plasma and power loading, the surface is strongly cooled due to the electron emission that occurs with the external energy flux and emission current density lower than 10^{8} W/cm^{2} and 10^{8} A/cm^{2}, respectively [6,7], preventing EEE initiation on a “clean” surface [42]. It must be emphasized that in our case, explosive overheating of the liquid-metal droplet itself obtained in Refs [6–8] is not necessary for ignition of EEE-cell, as the explosion is initiated at the tearing neck of the jet. This extends our consideration into the conditions of ignition by action of more rarefied plasma (less than 10^{20} cm^{−3}).
A. Temperature and density evolution
Let us consider a simplified temperature evolution equation for the material of the tearing liquid-metal jet neck that changes from the liquid-metal to the plasma state during the electrical explosion [43]
The equation takes into account the Joule heating (j^{2}/σ) and cooling due to expansion (−pdivv) and disregards the heat conduction and ionization losses. [Here, C is the heat capacity, M_{i} is the (ion) mass, n is the density, j is the current density, σ is the conductivity, p is the pressure, and v is the velocity.]
Note that in dense non-ideal plasma, intense ionization may occur due to a decrease in ionization potential [4,44]. Estimating the latter as –e^{2}/L_{D} ≈ −1.44 eV nm/L_{D}, we obtain a decrease in a few electron-volts even for the average metal-plasma parameters from Table I and a tenfold decrease for the critical state (∼1 eV and ∼10^{22} cm^{−3}) [27], as expected for the explosive plasma.
In addition, the expected Joule heating term for the explosion [1,2] is about 10^{15} W/cm^{3} (as the current density and the conductivity are about 1 GA/cm^{2} and 1 kS/cm, respectively), which is greater than the heat conduction term divλgradT ∼ λ T z^{−2} ∼ 10^{12} W/cm^{3} (as the thermal conductivity λ, temperature T, and longitudinal dimension z are about 1 W cm^{−1} K^{−1}, 10 kK, and 1 μm, respectively).
The density of the current flowing through the liquid-metal-jet neck (see Fig. 1) is given by
Let us take into account that the neck radius dr/dt =v decreases with velocity v = −e_{r}v_{l}, where v_{l} = 10^{4} cm/s, until the temperature Eq. (7) reaches its critical value T_{cr} ∼ 1 eV. As soon as this occurs (at t_{ex}), the material, being in the plasma state, starts expanding freely, as the cohesive energy vanishes at the matter critical point. The plasma expansion velocity is v = +e_{r}v_{pl}, where v_{pl} = (T/M_{i})^{1/2} ≈ 10^{3}T^{1/2 }cm s^{−1} K^{−1/2}. So, the radius entering Eq. (8) varies with time as
Thus, the current density (8) increases as j = I π^{−1} (R_{0} − v_{l}t)^{−2} until the explosion occurs and decreases as j = I π^{−1} (r_{0min} + v_{pl} t)^{−2} after the explosion. Here, R_{0} = r(0) and r_{0min} = r(t_{ex}) are the initial and the minimal neck radius, respectively. Hence, we have, for the current density (8), the relations
The matter density varies in accordance with the continuity equation as
For the unexploded liquid metal, we may put divv = 0 (incompressible liquid, n =const). After the explosion, the plasma expands nearly spherically (see Refs [1–4]) and so, for the plasma produced from the jet neck (point source), we may put divv = 2 v/r. Thus, the varying plasma density can be written as
Note that we have specified the same dependence (∝r^{−2}) for the current density and plasma density decreasing after the explosion [Eqs. (8) and (10)].
The pressure is given by p = n T, which is acceptable for a nearly critical state of matter and the temperature nearly above critical isotherm T_{cr} (see Refs [17] and  [28]) like in the case under consideration.
B. Conductivity
The resistance of a metal increases with temperature. This results in a positive feedback between the temperature growth and the Joule heat release, giving rise to a thermal runaway. As for plasmas, on the contrary, the conductivity increases with temperature, as the Coulomb collision cross section of interacting charged particles decreases. Therefore, it is clear that during an electrical explosion, conditions for a minimum conductivity (maximum resistance) are provided when the metal-to-plasma transition occurs. According to the experiment [45], the plasma conductivity measured during an electrical explosion was a minimum of 10^{2}–10^{3} S/cm at a temperature of about 1 eV and a density making about 0.01 of the solid-state density (several 10^{20} cm^{−3}). Let us neglect the density dependence and consider simple conductivity dependence from temperature as follows:
where ς_{met}=10^{7}KΩ{−1}cm{−1}, ς_{pl}=100eV{−3/2}Ω{−1}cm{−1}, and Θ=8kK.
C. Initial conditions
The burning phase of the vacuum arc cathode spot EEE-cell operation is characterized by a large emission current and low voltage, whereas the initiation phase, on the contrary, by low current and large voltage [2,46]. In the initiation phase, the current is transferred mostly by the ions from the preceding EEE cell plasma, and the large voltage prevents the plasma electrons reaching the cathode. Thus, let us restrict ourselves for consideration of the ion flux of the Bohm current density
(where M_{p}/M_{i} is the proton-to-ion mass ratio) that is collected by a liquid-metal-jet droplet from the preceding explosion (see Fig. 1). For a metal plasma of temperature T_{e} ∼ 1 eV and density n_{pl} = 10^{18} cm^{−3} generated in a cathode spot, the total ion current collected by a droplet of radius R_{droplet} ∼ 1 μm (see Fig. 1) is about 1 mA. Recall that such (low-density) plasma provides conditions approaching the threshold for the initiation of a new EEE center on a “clean” surface where liquid-metal jets play the dominant part [6,7].
The initial neck radius is R_{0} = 0.1 μm (the tearing time is R_{0}/v_{l} = 1 ns) (see the experimental observations [3,46]) and the initial temperature is T_{0} = T_{cr}/5. C = 1 J g^{−1} K^{−1}, n_{0} = 4 × 10^{22} cm^{−3}, and n_{0}M_{i} = 10 g cm^{−3}. The (ion) current in Eq. (8) is I = 1 mA.
IV. NUMERICAL CALCULATION RESULTS
Numerical calculation results for the temporal evolution of the temperature, current density, transverse size, and conductivity for the jet-neck material for the set of critical temperatures T_{cr} = 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 kK are being presented at Figs. 2 and 3. As one can see from these temporal dependencies that the neck explosion pulse consists of (i) the ignition of the explosion phase that is mostly defined by the hydro-dynamical liquid-metal jet tearing and (ii) the phase of decay of the density of the plasma and current.
One may find from the numerical results that the current density exceeds a level of GA/cm^{2} for a short time at the tearing and that the temperature after the explosion remains nearly about critical one, i.e., ∼1 eV.
Now we can evaluate the average values of the EEE plasma parameters in the pulse. Let us specify the averaging interval as the period from the time at which the critical temperature is reached to the time at which the plasma density decreases down to the background level n_{pl} = 10^{18} cm^{−3}.
As can be seen from Fig. 4, the average density ⟨n⟩ is about 10^{20} cm^{−3} and the average temperature ⟨T⟩ is about 1 eV, both being in agreement with the known typical values [1–4]. This agreement generally validates our model.
The ratio ⟨p⟩/⟨j⟩ is some tens of g cm s^{−1} C^{−1}, which is close to the values predicted by the original phenomenological models and to the measurements (see Table I and Refs [17–19]). It should be noted however that these values depend on the averaging interval that can be taken arbitrarily. Let us evaluate this dependence as well as more general results by deriving and analyzing the analytic solutions for Eqs. (7)–(14).
V. ANALYTICAL DEPENDENCIES EVALUATION
Assuming for the liquid-metal jet that its resistance linearly increases with temperature: 1/σ = T/ς (up to T_{cr}), we can obtain a solution of the temperature evolution Eq. (7) with current density j = I π^{−1} (R_{0} − v_{l} t)^{−2}(10) and divv = 0 for the liquid-metal phase
where CM_{i}n_{0} = 10 J K^{−1 }cm^{−3} and ς = 10^{7} S cm^{−1} K.
Thus, the minimal jet neck radius r_{0min} at T = T_{cr} is determined as
and the corresponding maximal current density j_{max} as
As can be seen from Fig. 5, for the plasma density that varies in the range of 10^{18}–10^{20} cm^{−3} (for the ignition of the cathode spot EEE cells with the temperature equal to about 1 eV and the droplet radius equal to about 1 μm), the corresponding r_{0min} range is from 3 to 50 nm and j_{max} range is from 1 to 4 GA/cm^{2}.
For I = 1 mA, used in the numerical calculations above, we have r_{0min} = 2.75 nm and j_{max} = 4.3 GA/cm^{2}.
In the extinction phase (after reaching T_{cr} at t > t_{ex}), the plasma density decreases much more rapidly than the temperature (see the calculation results in Fig. 2). Hence, we may assume that the average temperature is nearly constant and approximately equal to T_{cr}, and take the corresponding plasma expansion velocity v_{pl} = 10^{5} cm/s. [Note that the plasma (ions) acceleration in the expanding cathode flare (from the EEE cell) results in a nearly tenfold increase in velocity (see Table I, where v_{i} ∼ 10 v_{pl}, and Refs [8–10] and  [47]).] Therefore, the decrease in density (12) can be found as
with r_{0min} defined by Eq. (16).
A. Average decay time, plasma, and current densities
From Eq. (18), it follows that the time it takes for the density to decrease from the initial level, n_{0} = 4 × 10^{22} cm^{−3}, down to the external (surrounding) plasma density, n_{pl} = 10^{18} cm^{−3}, is
The average plasma density over this time is
where n(t) is given by Eq. (18). We see that these values agree with the numerical results from Sec. IV.
As the current density j(8) varies with time in the same manner as the plasma density n [see Eqs. (12) and (18)], the average current density can be found as
where
is the electron current drift velocity. According to the estimates, it is about 0.7 × 10^{6} cm/s, which is not above the thermal velocity v_{1}_{Th} = (T_{e}/2πm_{e})^{1/2}. The ratio v_{1}_{e}/v_{1}_{Th} = j/j_{pl} = κ is some hundredths of unity (see Fig. 2). Hence, we can roughly estimate v_{1}_{e} to be close to the ion sound velocity (T_{e}/M_{i})^{1/2}. Note that when v_{1}_{e} is greater than the electron thermal velocity (T_{e}/2πm_{e})^{1/2}, a fast two-stream (Buneman) instability builds up [26], and when v_{1}_{e} is greater than the ion sound velocity (T_{e}/M_{i})^{1/2}, a (slower) ion-acoustic instability builds up [48]. The latter has been indicated in the recent numerical modeling [49,50]. Recall that we disregard the increase in current density due to the plasma formation.
One can clearly see from Eqs. (19)–(21) what is the dependence of the averaged values on the density level.
B. Average plasma momentum, ohmic electric field, and current
The ratio of pressure to current density averaged over the EEE pulse gives the EEE plasma momentum per transferred charge, μ. It should be emphasized that the ratio
does not depend on the plasma density, which rapidly decreases during the extinction phase. The momentum μ estimated using Eq. (23) gives a value of some tens of g cm s^{−1} C^{−1}, which is close to the measured specific recoil force [18] and to the experimentally evaluated momentum v_{i} × γ_{i} (see Table I). Note that Eq. (23) includes only the parameters of the material during the explosion.
This finding supports the model of the pressure-gradient driven plasma acceleration during the EEE cell pulse.
Another important quantity is the ohmic electric field within the EEE plasma, E = j/σ. The average ohmic electric field ⟨E⟩ = ⟨j/σ⟩ can be estimated assuming that the conductivity is nearly constant and equal to that value at T_{cr}: σ ≈ σ(T_{cr})
As the conductivity at the explosion, σ(T_{cr}), is in the range of 100–1000 Ω^{−1 }cm^{−1}, the electric field ⟨E⟩ corresponds to the range of 10–100 kV/cm. Similar values (tens of kV/cm) result from our calculations (see Fig. 4 and Ref [50]).
It should be noted that there are “two fields”: the “thermal” (Debye) electric field E_{D}(6), which is about 10 MV/cm, and the “macroscopic” ohmic electric field ⟨E⟩ = ⟨j/σ⟩, which is substantially (1000 times) lower (tens of kV/cm). The latter field provides necessary current flow through the dense explosion plasma, and, as supposed [2,3], produces the cathode fall potential U_{c}, which is some tens of V [4].
Using Eq. (24), we can estimate the specific spatial scale of the dense EEE plasma as
and obtain the fact that it ranges between 1 and 10 μm, which agrees with the known explosive plasma size.
The estimates obtained using Eqs. (24) and (25) support the model that assumes the ohmic nature of the cathode potential fall.
The proposed model considers only a local point of a tearing liquid-metal jet. However, the explosion region extends from the neck to the remaining liquid-metal jet (see Fig. 1), resulting in an increased total current. Assuming that the total current flowing through an exploding jet increases due to an increase in emitting surface area [from (r_{0min})^{2} to r_{0min}L_{pl}], we can estimate it as
As L_{pl} is several micrometers and r_{0min} is several nanometers, the total current may be up to 1000 times the initial (ion) current I, that is, I_{tot} ∼ 1 A.
Similarly to the boiling that intensifies at a high material extraction rate (at a low surrounding pressure), the number of the EEE pulses produced by exploding jets increases with the total current transferred through the discharge plasma.
Let us evaluate a set of certain values using Eqs. (24)–(26). Let us specify σ(T_{cr}) = 400 S/cm and U_{c} = 22 V. As a result, we obtain ⟨E⟩ = 54 kV/cm, L_{pl} = 4 μm, and I_{tot} = 1.5 A.
VI. MAGNETIC FIELD INFLUENCE
It is of interest to estimate the influence of a magnetic field on the liquid-metal jet and plasma produced. As the jet neck narrows to a very small size, the current density through the jet increases to a high value. The small neck size and the high current density provide a strong magnetic field that can impede radial expansion of the plasma, resulting in its inward pinching.
However, simple estimates show that the magnetic field B = 2I/cr_{0min} = 0.2 I/r_{0min} G cm/A = 727 G, for radius r_{0min} = 2.75 nm and current I = 1 mA, produces a pressure B^{2}/8π = 0.02 atm = 1.57 × 10^{16} eV/cm^{3}, which is substantially lower than the maximum plasma pressure n_{0}T_{cr} ∼ 10^{22} eV/cm^{3}.
Next, taking into account that the maximum current density is a fraction of the thermal electron current density [see Eq. (2)], j = κ j_{pl}, we can evaluate the total current flowing through a plasma column of radius R as
and the corresponding magnetic field at the radius R as
The plasma-to-magnetic pressure ratio β ≡ 8πnT/B^{2} can be then evaluated by formula
which (i) does not increases but decreases with density and (ii) does not contain the temperature explicitly—only by a current fraction: κ < 1.
The temperature dependence enters into the magnetization parameter ωτ [there ω = eB/m_{e}c is the cyclotron frequency, τ = m_{e}^{1/2}T_{e}^{3/2}/(πΛe^{4}n) is the collisional time, and Λ is the Coulomb logarithm]. With magnetic field (28), it reads
which does not depend on the plasma density.
Substituting m_{e}c^{2} = 0.511 MeV and e^{2} = 0.144 μeV cm in Eqs. (29) and (30) gives
These relations show that nearby the explosive cell (where n > 10^{18} cm^{−3}, R < 10 μm, T_{e} ∼ 1 eV, and Λ ∼ 1) these parameters: ωτ ≪ 1 ≪ β. This means no influence of the magnetic field on the EEE-cell plasma.
The regimes of β < 1 are possible for the plasmas of large size and low density: n R^{2} = 1.41 × 10^{13} β^{−1} κ^{−2 }cm^{−1} > 10^{14} cm^{−1}, e.g., of 10 cm and 10^{14} cm^{−3} typical for the plasma pinches. The regimes of ωτ > 1 arise for plasmas of large size and temperature: T_{e}^{2}R = 0.092 ωτ Λ κ^{−1} eV^{2} cm.
Additionally, one can take into account the current flowing outside the explosive cell (r > R) assuming spherical expansion of the plasma nr^{2} = const (12). Then, current I(r) for r > R becomes
where ζ is the fraction of the electron current emitted from the surface outside the center. The corresponding magnetic field will be larger. Thence, the anisotropy of particle motion (ωτ > 1) and the plasma compression (β < 1) may arise at a distance from the EEE cell.
VII. DISCUSSION
We have proposed a simple complete model of the EEE pulse generated by a cathode spot cell that involves both the pulse ignition due to the tearing and electrical explosion of the liquid-metal jet ejected by the cell and the pulse extinction due to the expansion of the explosion plasma.
Our model being, for instance, a first approach to treat a whole EEE pulse of a cathode spot cell.
We have taken into account the peculiarities of the EEE pulse ignition under the action of plasma and the plasma formation and acceleration during a continuous metal-to-plasma transition that are currently known from the previous modeling studies. In particular, the energy flux from the cell plasma, q, can be determined approximately as
This formula implies that it is easier to heat up the surface (to exceed the threshold value for a clean surface of about 100 MW/cm^{2}) by the incident plasma electron flux—at low potential difference U. However, when a secondary EEE cell is ignited in a vacuum arc cathode spot, the potential increases [1,2,46], reducing the electron flux to the surface. We have taken into account that as well as low plasma density—of about 10^{18} cm^{−3} that is being near the threshold for the ignition at clean surface [6,7].
The obtained analytical relations for the key parameters for EEE-plasma during the explosion [Eqs. (15)–(17)] indicate that (at an incident plasma density <10^{20} cm^{−3} and current I < 0.1 A, see Fig. 5) the minimum radius r_{0min} and the maximum current density j_{max} weakly vary with external plasma density n_{pl}, temperature T_{e}, and ion-collecting droplet radius R_{droplet}
whereas the ignition time t_{ex}, defined as
is mostly determined by the hydrodynamic tearing of the liquid-metal jet. Recall that the higher incident plasma densities (n_{pl} > 10^{20} cm^{−3}) and currents (I > 0.1 A) correspond to the well-known case of EEE cell pulse ignition under initially intense power load and initially high current density [3].
The resulting current density j(t) exceeds a level of a few GA/cm^{2} within a short time (see Fig. 2). It should, however, be emphasized that there is no issues of the emission limitation by the emitted electron space charge nor the cooling of surface by strong electron emission [6] as the current of this large density flows inside of the tearing liquid-metal jet.
The transverse size of the jet decreases down to some nanometers, and this should affect the properties of the material. However, it has been found that the general properties of a vacuum arc cathode spot remain unchanged even for burning at layers consist of nanometer-scale wires [9,15,51].
Note that the term π(R_{0} − v_{l}t)^{2} in Eq. (10) that describes the decreasing cross-sectional area of the jet neck was used for simplicity. It provides a tearing time of about 1 ns, which is in reasonable agreement with the observations. A somewhat more accurate approach can be proposed to describe the geometry of a tearing liquid jet. The cross-sectional area of the contact of a sphere (of radius R_{0}) taken out from the liquid (at velocity v_{l}) decreases approximately as π(R_{0}^{2} − v_{l}^{2}t^{2}). Hence, for the increase in current density in a tearing liquid-metal jet, we may use, instead of Eq. (10), the formula j = I π^{−1} (R_{0}^{2} − v_{l}^{2}t^{2})^{−1} that also results in analytical solution [52] for the temperature, and Eq. (15) then becomes
where x = v_{l}t/R_{0}. However, Eq. (35) does not yield such simple formulas for minimum radius and maximum current density as Eqs. (16) and (17). More accurate results can be obtained by numerical modeling using the method proposed in Ref [32]. Tearing jet geometry can be modelled in 2D approach used in Refs [32–36] by specifying of the hollow external plasma with central liquid-metal jet. It is worth to mention that there are many numerical models that have been developed recently to describe the liquid-metal hydrodynamics in the conditions of a vacuum discharge [32–36,53–57]. Besides the studies on the formation of explosive cells in a cathode spot that are pertinent to this results, there are several recent works on modeling the liquid-metal hydrodynamics for the anode of a high-current vacuum arc discharge [54–57].
One of the most important results of this study is the estimation of the time-dependent parameters of the EEE cell plasma throughout the pulse. In addition, the plasma parameters averaged over the pulse have been obtained. Both numerical solutions have been done and the analytical dependencies have been derived with corresponding agreement of the results.
In particular, the plasma basic parameters, density and temperature, are about 10^{20} cm^{−3} and 1 eV, respectively. These values agree with the known ones that generally validates our model. In addition, it is consistent with the new average-critical-state model [17] for which the EEE plasma parameters have been evaluated in Sec. II for a wide range of materials.
The EEE cell plasma momentum per transferred charge, μ, has been derived as the ratio of the average pressure to the average current density, ⟨p⟩/⟨j⟩ [see Eq. (23)]
where n_{0} is the metal density, T_{cr} is the critical temperature, and j_{max} [see Eq. (17)] is the maximum current density in a tearing liquid-metal jet. According to our estimates, j_{max} is a few GA/cm^{2} (see Fig. 5).
Taking into account that the electron drift velocity v_{1e} = j_{max}/en_{0} [Eq. (22)] has been found to be close to the ion acoustic velocity (T_{cr}/M_{i})^{1/2}, we can estimate the EEE plasma momentum μ as (M_{i}T_{cr})^{1/2}/e. Also, it is worth taking into account that most of the EEE plasma ions are multiply charged. In particular, the average ion charge state, Z, for Li, Cu, and W is above +1, +2, and +3, respectively [4]. Hence, we should replace e in Eqs. (21)–(23) by Ze, and this finally results in the following approximate formula for the EEE plasma momentum per transferred charge:
This formula yields μ of some tens of g cm/(s C), which complies with the measured specific recoil force and the EEE plasma flare momentum estimated as v_{i} × γ_{i}, the product of the measured ion velocity and erosion rate (see Table I).
This finding supports the model of the pressure-gradient-driven plasma acceleration during the EEE cell pulse. This also agrees with the recent observation of a nearly linear dependence of the charge states of the plasma ions on their kinetic energy [58]. The linearity may be accounted for by that both the ion charge state and the kinetic energy depend on the plasma internal energy during the EEE cell pulse.
To estimate the EEE cell parameters, the conservation of momentum is widely used for the cathode spot cell components (the plasma ions and the liquid-metal fraction splashed outwards) [3,17,19,39,40]. However, this was known previously only from the phenomenology. And we have derived here a theoretical formula for the EEE plasma momentum.
The average ohmic electric field ⟨E⟩ = ⟨j/σ⟩ has been found to be several tens of kV/cm. This field is responsible for the current transfer through the explosion plasma. For the known cathode fall potential, the corresponding plasma size is several micrometers. Such a plasma is formed after the explosion of the entire liquid-metal jet. These results support the model implying the ohmic nature of the cathode potential fall in a vacuum arc. In addition, the total current flowing through an exploding liquid-metal jet has been estimated to be several amperes, which nearly corresponds to the threshold current. The current can be estimated more accurately by taking into account the geometry of the liquid-metal jet (see Fig. 1) and assuming energy dissipation by heat conduction.
Recall that to estimate the ohmic electric field and the EEE plasma momentum requires averaging the time-dependent pressure, current density, and conductivity over the EEE pulse. This has been done in this study for the first time. These quantities are widely used as input parameters in relevant numerical simulations, and we have derived them as output parameters from our model.
Finally, a general expression of the plasma-to-magnetic pressure ratio β = 8πp/B^{2} has been derived for a current-carrying plasma column (β κ^{2}n R^{2} = 4m_{e}c^{2}/e^{2} = 1.41 × 10^{13} cm^{−1}, κ=j2πm_{e}T_{e}/en<1). This expression indicates that a plasma column compression by a magnetic field (β < 1) may occur only for large-scale low-density plasmas (n R^{2} > 10^{14} cm^{−1}), and this is the case of the explosion plasma formed at a distance from EEE cells. The required particle motion anisotropy ωτ > 1 also arises at a distance from the EEE cell or for plasmas of larger temperature.
VIII. CONCLUSION
A model has been developed for the explosive electron emission cell pulse of a vacuum discharge cathode spot that describes both the ignition and the extinction of the explosion pulse. The ignition is due to the hydrodynamic tearing of the liquid-metal jet propagating from the preceding cell crater boundary and collecting the ion current from the plasma of the preceding explosion. As the jet neck is heated due to Joule heat release to a critical temperature, plasma is generated and begins to expand with decreasing density; this is the extinction phase of the explosion pulse.
Numerical and analytical solutions have been obtained that describe both the time behavior of the plasma parameters and their pulse-averaged values.
The explosive cell plasma momentum per transferred charge has been estimated to be tens of g cm/(s C), which agrees with known results of measurements of the ion velocity, erosion rate, and specific recoil force. This supports the model of the pressure-gradient driven plasma acceleration for explosive cathode spot cells.
The ohmic electric field within the current-carrying explosion plasma has been estimated to be tens of kV/cm, which agrees with known experimental results on the cathode fall potential and explosive cell plasma size. This supports the model that implies the ohmic nature of cathode potential fall in a vacuum discharge.
