Coercivity enhancement of FePd thin films prepared by the post-annealing of off-stoichiometric magnetron-sputtered multilayers
Attainment of perpendicular coercivity higher than 900 Oe and accurate calculation of the degree of long-range order in an FePd alloy thin film is essential in the realization of the perpendicular magnetic recording media. Here, we prepared the off-stoichiometric FePd films through the multilayer growth of [Fe(2 nm)/Pd(2 nm)] × 30 deposited on MgO(001) substrates by magnetron sputtering. The effects of post-annealing these films at 700 °C for 1 and 10 h on their surface morphologies, and crystallographic and magnetic characteristics were investigated. The results show that, with increasing annealing time, the FePd thin films are predominantly (001)-oriented with a progressive increase of the grain size and surface roughness, as well as the improved crystallinity and reduced micro-strain. Accordingly, the perpendicular coercivity is significantly increased to the value of 1.5 kOe, and Pd loses its 4d electrons upon alloying. Furthermore, analysis of X-ray absorption data elucidates some structural details of the Fe scattering phase in addition to the dominant tetragonal FePd phase. We also present a way of determining the long-range order parameter for the FePd alloy thin film, using the combined information of the tetragonality ratio extracted from extended x-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy and the stoichiometric deviation of the thin film.
I. INTRODUCTION
L1_{0}-type ordered intermetallic magnetic alloys, such as FePd, FePt, and CoPt, have drawn intensive attention due to their large uniaxial magneto-crystalline anisotropy constants (K_{u}) [1] useful to maintain enough thermal stability for spin-based applications. FePd with K_{u} from 13 to 18 Merg/cm^{3} and perpendicular coercivity less than 8 kOe may be more preferred than its L1_{0} counterparts for fully functionalized magnetic recording media [2,3] or nanocomposite magnets [4,5]. Furthermore, an L1_{0}-ordered FePd thin film having a low Gilbert damping constant [6,7] is also promising for being used as the free layer in the magnetic tunnel junction [8] of a thermally assisted spin-transfer torque magnetic random access memory.
Over the years, extensive research has been devoted to studying the process of structure formation and the relationship between the structural and magnetic properties of L1_{0}-FePd thin films. It is known that the L1_{0}-FePd phase with perpendicular anisotropy can be induced on the MgO(001) substrate [2,3,9–15] by either performing deposition at an elevated temperature or post-annealing after initial deposition at a lower temperature [16]. For example, Wang et_al [17] previously prepared their samples using the co-evaporation method at an elevated temperature of 500 °C. In addition, Endo et_al [18] described the multilayers grown with the Fe layer thickness fixed at 2.50 nm and the nominal Pd layer thickness varied from 0.75 to 5.50 nm, for eight bilayers. The as-deposited Fe/Pd multilayers were subsequently annealed at a temperature ranging 573–973 K for 1 h under a vacuum pressure lower than 1.3×10^{−4}Pa. Despite their samples being powder-like without a preferred orientation, probably due to their choice of thicknesses of the individual layers, such exploit of multilayered Fe/Pd structures may accelerate the diffusivity of Fe and Pd atoms into the L1_{0} lattice in a similar manner to the atomic rearrangement in the unit cell [19–21]. This method also offers the easy control of the film composition by tuning the individual layer thickness of the multilayer [18]. The physics of “not co-deposition” and post-annealing could involve a series of nucleation growth under a longer distance of diffusion as compared to co-deposition. The coercivity value is therefore tunable by the multilayer process and post-annealing. Besides the information mentioned earlier, more recently, research studies are shifting to address some detailed features of FePd thin films, such as the redistribution of atoms when forming the L1_{0} alloy [22], their nanomechanical properties as a function of depth [1], or the role of stacking fault density in improving the coercivity of a thin film [3]. One of the remaining issues is that the perpendicular coercivity in most literature studies was reportedly lower than 900 Oe [23,24], and efforts are ongoing to achieve the practical values of 6–8 kOe [2,3,9]. An unconventional way of enhancing coercivity is to prepare the alloy film off-stoichiometrically. Additional Fe atoms could form precipitates in the inter-grain regions, or cause more defects, dislocations, or stacking faults which are possible to enhance coercivity [3].
An accurate determination of the degree of long-range order in the FePd alloy film, which may play an important role in the film's magnetic hardness, is indispensable. The square of the long-range order parameter (LROP) is usually deduced from the integrated intensities of the superlattice peak versus the fundamental peak acquired from powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments [9,11–13,25]. This method is commonly acceptable for the purpose of expeditious comparison of a series of samples altering only one parameter (such as temperature or concentration of doping, etc.) while other conditions remain unchanged. However, a precise measurement requires a full correction of intricate interplays of many factors: the structure, Lorentz polarization, absorption, temperature, etc [26]. The other method is based on the c/a ratio of the FePd unit cell [18,25] and therefore requires the determination of the lattice parameter a by an in-plane XRD measurement for a highly textural thin film. Nevertheless, quite often in the literature using in-house XRD equipment, the intensity is inadequate for this quantitative estimation method. In addition, the identity of that in-plane XRD peak is often inconclusive for a non-stoichiometric [17,18] and non-epitaxial thin film, leaving one reluctant to assign it as either the lattice parameter a of the L1_{0}–(001) phase or the c-axis of the L1_{0}-(100) and L1_{0}-(010) variants [15,27]. Recently, Braidy et_al [26] have proposed a method, taking into account both the compositional information of the alloy and bond lengths of the nearest neighbors. In the method, both bond lengths within and between [002] planes of the L1_{0}-structure were considered. Those local structures can be probed effectively by the extended x-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy (EXAFS), which we will describe in this work. However, the use of EXAFS on this material is scarce. In particular, Krupinski et_al [28] reported an EXAFS study at Fe K-edge on FePd and FePd:Cu, but the additional Fe phase was not considered, and statistical values for the fits were missing in that research.
In this article, post-annealing up to 10 h was applied to off-stoichiometric FePd multilayers on MgO(001) substrates. We investigate the influence of this process on the surface morphology, crystallographic structure, and magnetic property, following the FePd alloy formation. We show that the multilayer growth of 30 stacks of Fe(2 nm)/Pd(2 nm) at room temperature plus post-deposition annealing longer than 1 h (up to 10 h) leads to a highly textured FePd alloy thin film and is helpful for increasing the coercive field towards practical values. A thorough EXAFS analysis indicates existence of both the predominant FePd scattering phase and an additional short-ranged Fe scattering phase in our post-annealed films. Furthermore, we show a calculation method for the long-range order parameter, which employs the data derived from the stoichiometric deviation and the tetragonality ratio extracted from the fitted EXAFS results.
II. EXPERIMENTS
[Fe (2 nm)/Pd (2 nm)]×30 multilayers were prepared using dc magnetron sputtering onto polished MgO(001) single-crystal substrates (MaTeck GmbH, Juelich, Germany), each of which has an accuracy of ±0.5° and a surface roughness of less than 5 Å. The chamber was pumped to a background pressure lower than 45 μPa, and the substrate was outgassed for 30 min at ∼550 °C. Then, film growth was performed at room temperature and in an argon pressure of 0.67 Pa. The film thickness due to either Fe or Pd deposition was monitored using separate quartz crystal microbalances. The applied current for sputtering was 250 and 95 mA, respectively, for Fe and Pd targets of 99.99 at. % purity. Among the grown samples, two of them were subsequently annealed at 700 °C for 1 and 10 h under high vacuum condition.
The morphology of the films was observed using a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM; FEI Inspect-F, USA) operating at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV and a working distance of 15.4 mm. The elemental composition was obtained by an Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometer (EDS; JEOL JSM-6330F, JEOL, Japan) using a current of 10.5 μA, a potential of 15 kV, and a working distance of 15 mm. The surface roughness of these films was measured by atomic force microscopy under a tapping-mode (AFM, Veeco di Innova, USA). We used a silicon cantilever (OMCL-AC240TS-R3, Olympus, Japan) that has a resonance frequency of 70 kHz and a spring constant of 1.7 N/m.
Magnetic characterization was carried out at room temperature on a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM, Model 7407, Lakeshore cryotronics, Inc., USA). Longitudinal and perpendicular magnetization curves were recorded at fields up to 18 kOe. During the data collection, the magnetic field was varied by an increment of 200 Oe and a ramp rate of 20 Oe/s.
X-ray characterizations of the samples were performed at several beam-lines of the Taiwan Light Source, National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction was measured at the wiggler beamline BL-17B [29] using the wavelength λ=1.54208 Å, scanning step 0.01°, and cumulative time 1 s/step. X-ray reflectivity (XRR) measurements were performed to monitor the evolution of the sample transforming from a multilayer structure into a single layer after 1 h of annealing. X-ray absorption (XAS) spectra at Fe K-edge (7112 eV) and Pd L_{3}-edge (3604 eV) were recorded in fluorescence mode at room temperature using a Lytle detector and a Si (111) double-crystal monochromator on the BL01C and BL16A beamlines. Fe and Pd metallic foils were used for initial energy calibration. The sample was rotated 45° relative to the incident X-ray beam. The XAS data were acquired up to 17 Å^{−1} in k-space above the absorption edge with a constant step equal to Δk=0.05 Å^{−1} and a dwell time being changed increasingly from 4 to 8 s. The final absorption spectrum for each sample was obtained by aligning and merging at least three single scans. As the samples were sufficiently thin, any self-absorption effects on the data can, therefore, be neglected. The EXAFS structural analysis and fitting were performed using the Athena and Artemis programs included in the Demeter package [30].
III. DATA ANALYSIS
A. Micro-strain and grain-size analysis
The grain size and the micro-strain along the [001] direction are estimated from the Williamson-Hall analysis [31]. The integral width is written as β=1/D+2〈ε〉Q, where D in this case is the vertical coherence length and 〈ε〉=〈Δd〉/d is the micro-strain, d is the spacing between planes of atoms, Q=4πsinθ/λ, λ is the X-ray wavelength, and θ is the Bragg angle. The empirical peak shape function Pseudo Voigt was used to fit each peak found in Fig. 1 to determine the full width at half maximum and peak positions. Figure 2 shows Williamson-Hall plots of FePd multilayers with annealing time of 1 and 10 h, respectively.
B. EXAFS analysis
The EXAFS data analysis in the present study requires an unconventional approach for the inclusion of a dual scattering phase mixture in our sample: tetragonal FePd (t-FePd) and additional Fe (a-Fe). The EXAFS equation for a mixture of materials [32] contributing to the measured edge is written as
where, as Kelly et_al [33] explain, the wave number k is given by k^{2}=2m_{e}(E−E_{0j})/ℏ, the index j represents different constituents of the mixture, and the index i represents the neighbor atoms. E_{0j} is the energy threshold for 1s excitation. F_{ji}(k) and δ_{ji}(k) are the effective scattering amplitude and phase shift, respectively. λ(k) is the mean free path of the photoelectron, and N_{ji,pure} is the degeneracy of path. σji2 is the mean squared displacement about the equilibrium relative distance. R_{ji}=R_{0j}+ΔR_{j}; R_{0j} is the initial path length and ΔR_{j} is the change in half-path length. S0j2 is the fractional passive electron reduction factor, S0j2=X_{j}S02, and X_{j} is the fraction of the absorbing atoms present as constituent j such that ∑jX_{j}=1. Therefore, we have S02=S012+S022, where S012 is for the t-FePd scattering phase and S022 is for the a-FePd scattering phase.
Theoretical χ(k) was generated with the known structural parameters listed in Table I. We assumed the body centered cubic (bcc) unit cell of Fe crystal [34] as a close enough EXAFS model of a-Fe and considered the ordered FePd with the body centered tetragonal (bct) unit cell [35]. A larger FePd unit cell, illustrated in Fig. 3(a), is conventionally used in the literature for the face centered tetragonal (fct) structure [11,36]. Here, we refer the FePd alloy to a bct structure when explaining EXAFS data. Table II and Figs. 3(b) and 3(c) list and give a schematic illustration of four single scattering paths associated with the first shells of both phases. Fourier transforms of the experimental data were performed with a Hanning window and in the Δk range of 2–15.8 Å^{−1} for the photoelectron momentum k and the ΔR range of 1.4–3.2 Å for the uncorrected phase radial distance R. The relation N≈(2/π)ΔR×Δk provides approximately 16 independent parameters that can be extracted from the data analysis. We have parametrized 10 variables in total: 9 variables for ΔR_{j}, σji2, and ΔE0j (shown in Table II) plus 1 variable for the amplitude term S02. We note that variables with the same guessed values introduce no new variables. Accordingly, the variable for ΔR_{j} of the both paths of a-Fe phase is given as α×R_{eff}, where α accounts for an isotropic expansion of the bcc-like phase. We performed a series of fits iterating S02 from 0.7 to 1.1 with an increment of 0.02. For each set value of S02, we made the guess S012=S02 when setting S02=S012+S022 and fitted the data simultaneously with multiple k weightings from 1 to 3.
C. Determination of the long-range order parameter
Considering an ordered Fe_{0.5+δ}Pd_{0.5−δ} structure, where δ is the deviation from stoichiometry, a linear relationship between the square of the LROP and the c/a ratio is written according to the work of Braidy et_al [26] as
where θ(δ)=L^{−}4ℓ(δ), ℓ(δ)=14L^{+}+L^{−}δ^{2}, L^{−}=2R_{Fe0→Fe1.1}−2R_{Fe0→Pd1.1}, L^{+}=2R_{Fe0→Fe1.1}+2R_{Fe0→Pd1.1}, K=1+κ^{2}2, and κ=c/a_{fct}. The reference lengths R_{Fe0→Fe1.1} and R_{Fe0→Pd1.1} represent the optimal bond length of the first nearest-neighbor atom pairs within and between [002] planes in the fct-FePd structure. The above operators can be rewritten in terms of lattice parameters of a bct-FePd structure determined from EXAFS fitting results as L^{−}=2a_{bct}−2abct2+c^{2} and L^{+}=2a_{bct}+2abct2+c^{2}.
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of the samples measured using the wavelength λ = 1.54208 Å. For the as-deposited multilayers [Fe (2 nm)/Pd (2 nm)]×30 on the MgO(001) substrate, there is only a broad peak at q ≈ 3.3 Å^{−1} apart from the MgO peak in the spectrum. This observation indicates that the as-deposited sample is a multilayer thin film with each individual layer being amorphous-like, which was also verified by XRR. In contrast, both profiles of the samples annealed at 700 °C for 1 and 10 h reveal (001) and (003) superlattice peaks of the ordered t-FePd phase in addition to the (002) fundamental peak. As compared to diffraction peaks of L1_{0}-FePd in the bulk [35], the center position of peaks (001) and (002) of the annealed samples shifts towards lower 2θ, while the determination of the (003) peak position is less correct for a comparison. For the 1 h-annealed sample, the shifts are 0.72° and 1.54°, and those of the 10 h-annealed sample are 0.69° and 1.54°, respectively. These shifts may show the misfit strain due to the substrate and off-stoichiometry. If the peak shift is not closely related to the annealing, then it could be due to off-stoichiometry only. Only (00n) diffraction peaks that come into sight in the whole diffraction patterns signify the highly textured FePd films to the (001) planes. Furthermore, every (00n) peak of the 10 h annealed sample has a narrower width and a higher intensity, about one order of magnitude, than those in the 1 h case, implying improved crystallinity and larger grain sizes. This initial implication is further confirmed by the results (summarized in Table III) of coherent lengths and micro-strains obtained from the Williamson-Hall plots in Fig. 2. The above-mentioned results imply that although the t-FePd is easily induced by thermal annealing, an accumulative time up to 10 h is necessary for the promotion of a higher quality alloy. The following analyses will focus on the relevant properties in accord with these improvements of crystallinity. The long-range order parameter will be discussed below.
Figures 4 and 5 depict SEM and AFM images respectively, revealing the morphological evolution of the surface for the samples with the annealing process. The micrographs of the multilayers without annealing show a flat surface with a small roughness of R_{a} = 0.69 nm, where R_{a} is the arithmetic average of surface height deviations measured from the mean plane. Contrarily, the 1 and 10 h annealed films display rather rougher surfaces with the R_{a} of 4.56 nm and 4.53 nm, respectively. They also exhibit similar dense, homogeneous microstructures indicating condensation of the deposited materials on the MgO substrate albeit that the grain sizes increase with annealing time. On the one hand, the striking differences in morphology between the samples with and without annealing are attributed to the thermal energy that promotes the coalescence of the adjacent grains or nuclei into larger grains during the annealing process [1]. It can also be explained by strain energy due to the lattice mismatch of the films and the MgO substrate. The lattice mismatch is −7.6% between MgO and the first Pd layer of the room-temperature deposited sample, whereas theoretically −9.5% between L1_{0}-FePd and MgO. Therefore, the annealed samples must have strained further to match with the substrate lattice spacing, resulting in a transverse expansion of the lattice. On the other hand, the similarity on the particulate topology and surface roughness of the two annealed FePd thin films may suggest that 1 h of annealing is enough for macro-strain relief, and a longer annealing process mainly influences the refinement of the micro-strain.
Regarding the magnetic characteristics, Fig. 6 displays the magnetization-field (M-H) curves obtained by the VSM, applying magnetic fields both perpendicular and parallel to the film plane. We note that a maximum field of 18 kOe used here and in some previous works [6,9,11,15,27] is lower than the anisotropy field (∼33 kOe) of the equi-atomic bulk FePd. The saturation field for thin film samples in the literature depends inversely on the thickness of thin films, i.e., the saturation field of a thicker film is expected to be much lower than that of a several-tens-of nanometer sample. For example, the saturation field was observed by Clavero et_al [2] to be 15 kOe in the 3-nm-thick film and 7 kOe in the 22-nm-thick sample, which was explained to be due to the coalesce of nanoparticles with the film's increasing thickness. The magnetization of our off-stoichiometric samples with a thickness of about 120 nm might have approached saturation already. However, owing to our limitation of the maximum field of the VSM machine, we do not rule out the possibility of the existence of minor loops. Although this issue does not alter the conclusions presented in the following, it should be taken into account when optimizing the magnetic measurements for absolute values of coercive fields. The results clearly show a striking change in the width of the hysteresis loops: from being indiscernible in the as-deposited FePd multilayers, thus indicative of being magnetically soft, to slightly open-up after 1 h of annealing at 700 °C, and then further widened after 10 h of annealing. The enlargement of the M-H loops in the main figure shows an enhancement of coercivity values reported in the inset figure of Fig. 6. For more details, the room-temperature deposited FePd multilayers show small, but nonzero, coercive fields of about 20 Oe for both directions of external fields. Whereas the perpendicular and transverse coercivity values of the 1-h-annealed sample are 0.39 kOe and 0.11 kOe, those of the 10-h-annealed sample are 1.5 kOe and 0.85 kOe, respectively. As such, coercivity is improved with increasing annealing time, and the coercive fields for the perpendicular M-H loops are typically several times larger than those of the in-plane M-H loops. These results qualitatively hint that a strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy is closely related to the formation and growth of the FePd alloy as a consequence of the annealing process. Since coercivity depends principally on the domain wall pinning that impedes magnetization reversal, the possible rise of pinning centers [3,9,23] as concomitants of the increased t-FePd phase could be a reasonable explanation for the accretion of coercivity. Another fact worth mentioning is that for the sample with 10 h of annealing the perpendicular magnetization near the saturation field is less than the parallel one. Additionally, the slopes of the out-of-plane M-H curves are lower than those for the in-plane ones. We suspect that these could result from a demagnetizing effect, due to a coupling of FePd and a soft magnetic Fe phase, which favors the in-plane magnetization. The EXAFS analysis presented below will provide proof for this speculation.
The effect of alloying on the charge redistribution at the Pd and Fe sites was investigated using the x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) technique which is highly sensitive to changes in the unoccupied density of states at and above the Fermi level. Figures 7 and 8 show experimental XANES spectra at Pd L_{3}-edge and Fe K-edge of the FePd samples together with pure Pd and Fe metal foil references. Some information on d and p characters of Pd and Fe are revealed. Consistent with previous studies [37,38], the Pd L_{3}-edge XANES spectrum of the bulk Pd consists of a prominent white line–feature A–attributable to a 2p_{3/2} → 4d dipole allowed transition, peaks B-D arising from transitions to the hybridized 5p-4d states, and peak E resulting from an interaction of the 5d band with the 4f band. Regarding these constituents, three discernible attributes are worthy of attention when comparing the spectra of the studied samples in Fig. 7. First, it is conspicuously evident that the area under the white line increases monotonically as going from the Pd metal foil to the FePd multilayers, and then to the FePd-alloy thin films. This observation implies a decrease in the d-electron count at the Pd site in the alloy, thus proving that Pd loses d charge upon alloying with Fe. Second, a slight shift of the white line maximum toward higher energy is also noticeable, which likely indicates that Pd d densities of states may have moved away from the Fermi level. Third, after the edge, the oscillatory behavior of the spectra of the FePd alloy samples closely matches peak to peak with the spectrum of the Pd metal foil, but this resemblance does not exhibit in the case of the FePd multilayer sample. Rather, its spectrum is smooth without a distinct valley between peak B and peak C, in addition to the considerably diminished peak D. An identical situation occurs at Fe K-edge (Fig. 8) where the smoothness of the XANES spectrum of this sample is in contrast to some well-resolved features in the spectra of the other specimens. These aspects, again, support the fact that the as-deposited FePd multilayer sample is amorphous-like in each individual layer. The Fe K-edge XANES results also show an increasing trend in the intensity of the white line shifting to lower energy following the alloy formation. However, one should be skeptical about associating this observation with the common perspective that the Fe valence decreases, which will conflict with the electronegativity rule. More likely, the observation is related to a higher atomic number around Fe. A substantive explanation for the exact nature of the total net charge redistribution awaits more elaborate investigation.
Let us now compare our finding with previous results on the d-type charge at the Pd site found for some Pd-based bimetallic alloys, including Pd-Ti [39], Pd-Cu [40], and Pd-Ag [41]. For the Pd-Ti alloy system, Pd also loses 4d charge, and Ti gains d charge upon bond formation. However, the overall charge flow is still from Ti to Pd since the depletion of d-type charge at the Pd site is compensated by a gain in the sp-type conduction electrons. For the case of Pd-Cu, the d-occupancy at the Pd site increases upon alloy formation, which otherwise disagrees with the cases of Pd-Ti and Fe-Pd herein. Finally, it was found for the Pd-Ag alloy that when alloying, both Pd and Ag similarly gain d charge and lose non-d charge. Thus, while the change in d-orbital occupancies can be estimated experimentally from the white line area, in accordance with the electronegativity arguments, a charge compensation mechanism must be engaged to obtain a full interpretation of the observation.
In the remaining discussion, we limit our comments to the EXAFS data of the 10-h-annealed sample. It is worthwhile to mention that efforts to fit the data with the model including only a single scattering phase of L1_{0}-FePd or to fit the 1 h-annealed sample with the same model used here do not yield satisfactory results. It seems that the annealing process as long as 10 h is eventually sufficient for the formation of the only two dominant phases appropriate for the analysis presented in Sec. III B. The resulting R-factor, the reduced chi-square, and details of the fitted values shown in Table IV are of good statistical quality and make certain for S02=1. In addition, Fig. 9 shows a fit obviously right upon visual inspection for EXAFS data of the 10-h-annealed Fe/Pd multilayers: (a) Magnitude and (b) real part of Fourier transform from the corresponding EXAFSs in k-space processed with a k weighting of 3, k^{3}χ(k). We can deduce some properties. First, the EXAFS data validate the model of a dual-scattering-phase mixture: t-FePd and a-Fe. This finding is consistent with the previous Mössbauer study [21] asserting a long-term redistribution of Fe atoms for the formation of the equilibrium tetragonal phase. Second, that the σji2 values of a-Fe scattering phase are rather large suggests that the sample possesses more disorder about the a-Fe phase than in the model. Third, in the case of the a-Fe phase, the change of the radial distance found for Fe → Fe1.1 and Fe → Fe1.2 is −0.184 and −0.212 Å, respectively. On that account, such smaller volume may indicate that this phase is subject to a compressive force of the accumulative t-FePd phase. Fourth, for the t-FePd phase, the σji2 value of the path Fe0 → Fe1.1 is 0.003 Å^{2}, which means that the relative displacement is well ordered. In comparison with that, the path Fe0 → Pd1.1 shows a higher disorder. We attribute this difference mostly to the multilayer deposition method that may facilitate a higher inter-atomic correlation between two Fe atoms in the same material layer than that of an Fe atom with a Pd atom as a consequence of diffusion. Fifth, using the formulas demonstrated in Sec. III C, we obtain the LROP of ∼1 for t-FePd phase of the 10 h-annealed sample with δ=0.12 determined from the EDS measurement. For the LROP calculation, we assume that the sample is a homogeneous mixture of Fe and Pd with a uniform composition throughout. Most of the additional Fe was dissolved into FePd alloy and into the grain boundary to hinder the magnetic domain size, create micro-strain, and enhance coercivity. Ultimately, the XRD and EXAFS analyses together provide us with a picture illustrated in Fig. 10. Accordingly, the multilayers of Fe and Pd at the as-deposited state transform into t-FePd clusters with a (001)-textured-grain size of ∼9.4 nm and then ∼21.1 nm after 1 and 10 h of annealing at 700 °C. The well-annealed thin film includes the t-FePd phase, with the LROP of ∼1, embedded in the disordered matrix. The LROP of ∼1 herein accounts for the off-stoichiometric t-FePd phase with a deviation of stoichiometry of 0.12 and the c/a_{fct} ratio of 0.854 which is much smaller than the value 0.965 of the bulk equi-atomic L1_{0}-FePd structure.
V. CONCLUSIONS
We have investigated a handful of physical properties on the FePd alloy, which is formed by annealing the room-temperature deposited multilayers of [Fe (2 nm)/Pd (2 nm)]×30 on MgO(001) substrates. The results show that as subject to post-annealing at 700 °C up to 10 h, the FePd thin films become highly (001)-textured with a larger grain size, enhanced crystallinity, reduced micro-strain, and increased perpendicular coercivity to 1.5 kOe. Besides, the L_{3}-edge XANES data confirm the depletion of d charge at the Pd site upon alloying. Furthermore, the EXAFS analysis reveals some local structural details of the additional Fe scattering phase in addition to the dominant FePd phase. Consequently, our current research poses the significance of an annealing process in raising the coercivity of an FePd thin film prepared by multilayer deposition and sheds some light on the additional Fe phase that might undermine the performance of the deposited tetragonal FePd phase. Finally, the method for determination of the long-range order herein can be generalized to other L1_{0}-type materials.
