Acoustic wave propagation in a temporal evolving shear-layer for low-Mach number perturbations
We study wave packets with the small perturbation/gradient Mach number interacting with a smooth shear-layer in the linear regime of small amplitude perturbations. In particular, we investigate the temporal evolution of wave packets in shear-layers with locally curved regions of variable size using non-modal linear analysis and direct numerical simulations of the two-dimensional gas-dynamical equations. Depending on the wavenumber of the initially imposed wave packet, three different types of behavior are observed: (i) The wave packet passes through the shear-layer and constantly transfers energy back to the mean flow. (ii) It is turned around (or reflected) within the sheared region and extracts energy from the base flow. (iii) It is split into two oppositely propagating packages when reaching the upper boundary of the linearly sheared region. The conducted direct numerical simulations confirm that non-modal linear stability analysis is able to predict the wave packet dynamics, even in the presence of non-linearly sheared regions. In the light of existing studies in this area, we conclude that the sheared regions are responsible for the highly directed propagation of linearly generated acoustic waves when there is a dominating source, as it is the case for jet flows.
I. INTRODUCTION
The propagation of acoustic waves is a central problem and of practical importance, e.g., for the design of modern turbo machinery. We investigate the problem of aerodynamic sound propagation in a free plane shear flow with a non-constant shear rate in the light of the breakthrough achieved by the hydrodynamic stability community in the 1990s. In particular, the mathematical specificity of shear flow systems was revealed and rigorously proven (see, e.g., Refs [1–5] and references therein); when applying modal analysis, the appearing operators are non-normal (non-self-adjoint) and, consequently, the corresponding eigenmodes are non-orthogonal [3–7]. Due to this non-orthogonality, the eigenmodes interfere strongly, which is why a suitable approach needs to be applied in order to fully analyze this behavior. In the framework of the classical spectral, so-called modal approach that focuses on the asymptotic stability of flows, little attention is paid to any particular initial value or finite time period of the dynamics. Consequently, the transient behavior, the main feature of shear flows dynamics, is regarded as having no significance and is left for speculation. By discarding the modal analysis and adopting the so-called non-modal approach, these issues are circumvented, and the transient dynamics can be grasped.
We focus on the dynamical processes in a two-dimensional (2D) temporal evolving unbounded mixing-layer. This problem has attracted much attention in the past century. First, this is motivated by the need for a more rigorous understanding of the evolution of waves generated inside a jet. Moreover, sound waves that are scattered from the end of the jet-pipe can penetrate the zone of silence to an appreciable extent [8]. The importance of the sheared regions behind modern jet engines is well acknowledged—any sound produced by an aircraft engine must pass through a single shear-layer or multiple shear-layers [9]. The shortcomings of canonically applied approaches, involving the misconception of linear sound production mechanisms by acoustic analogies [10] and the notion of a “turning level” (or “critical layer”) in shear flows [11], make it necessary to critically assess the thereby obtained results and predictions.
Analyzing the dynamics of a localized wave packet as it interacts with the linearly sheared and non-linearly (curved) regions of a shear-layer is appealing because this model is commonly applied to study aerodynamic sound generation and mixing characteristics, especially of the near-nozzle region of jets and wakes [12]. For this reason, it has been the topic of various analytical, experimental, and numerical research projects (see, e.g., Refs [8],  [13], and  [14], and references therein). According to Jones [8], it is literally the simplest non-linearly sheared model that can be contemplated. The velocity profile U(y) varies smoothly from the minimum to the maximum value of the shear velocity over some distance L, where it then remains constant and is illuminated by acoustic radiation. Although sound generation and propagation in the temporal configuration cannot be considered to be equal to the spatial counterpart, it is believed that some trends are in common in both configurations. Thereby, we follow the spirit of Cheung and Lele [15] in order to first of all gain a fundamental understanding of the 2D processes, before studying more complex three-dimensional (3D) problems.
Sound waves passing through a shear-layer are altered in amplitude and direction. Hence, an observer situated in the far field on one side of a shear-layer will in general hear sound that differs significantly from the sound originally produced by a source on the other side. Recent direct numerical simulations (DNS) performed by Hau et_al [10] suggest that any—linearly or non-linearly generated—wave passing through a sheared region is altered in a certain manner. This leads to distinct wave fronts, depending on the time span they reside inside the sheared region. Crighton and Huerre [16] were the first to use the term superdirectivity in order to describe the characteristic, coherent form of the sound field, which was observed by Laufer and Yen [17] in experiments on a low-speed round jet. These coherent structures are found to be fluctuations of a convected wave form, exhibiting the characteristics of amplification, saturation, and decay. According to Baqui et_al [18], these instability waves (sometimes also referred to as wave packets) arise due to the divergence of the jet, i.e., the spatially developing sheared regions in the mean velocity profile of the jet. Even though high Reynolds number turbulent jets are characterized by the presence of small-scale structures across a wide range of wavenumbers and frequencies, it has been observed that turbulence establishes an equivalent base flow profile. Specifically, the instability modes about this time-invariant base flow result in wave packets in the jet’s shear-layer. These constitute a relatively small fraction of the total disturbance energy [19]. Nonetheless, they are acoustically significant owing to their high space-time coherence compared with the integral scales of turbulence [20,21]. The described advecting large-scale structures in the physical flow domain correspond to low-frequency and low-azimuthal wavenumber wave packets in the Fourier domain [22].
The remainder of this work is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we describe the general flow configuration used throughout this work. The corresponding base velocity profile contains a linear shear region in the core of flow, which we analyze in Sec. III. Using the corresponding results, we proceed to the non-linearly sheared case in Sec. IV while focusing on the choice of initial conditions, the numerical discretization, and the parameter choices for the different cases considered in this work. This is followed by a discussion of the numerical results in Sec. V. Finally, we conclude in Sec. VI.
II. FLOW CONFIGURATION
Within this work, we study the propagation of sound waves in inviscid ideal gas with the heat capacity ratio γ. The considered flow configuration (cf. Fig. 1) is derived from the classical approximation of the base velocity profile inside of a shear-layer by a tanh-profile [23]. Expanding the velocity in a Taylor series, it can easily be seen that there exists a core region y ∈ [0, L] where the shear is approximately constant. In order to obtain a smooth velocity profile, we have to connect this region to the constant velocities in the non-sheared regions via suitable curved regions of finite size. We thus introduce a variable length scale l to define the non-linearly sheared regions y ∈ [−l, 0] and y ∈ [L, L + l] by means of exponential functions (cf. Fig. 1, left part). A similar profile has been used by Guha and Lawrence [24], who studied different shear-layer instabilities in homogeneous and stratified shear flows. However, this study used a piecewise-linear velocity profile, whereas the smooth profile discussed in this work allows us to vary the shearwise extent of the curved, non-linearly sheared regions.
The full base flow field is defined as (ϱ,U,V,P){T}=(ϱ0,U0,0,P0){T}, where the base density ϱ_{0} and the base pressure P_{0} are constant. For simplicity, we choose ϱ_{0} = 1 and P_{0} = γ^{−1} such that the base speed of sound equals unity, i.e., c_{s} = 1. The convective global Mach number is then given by
We define the full profile of the horizontal velocity U_{0} = U_{0}(y) via
As a result, we have U_{0,min} = 0 and set U_{0,max}=Mc_{s}/(2+Ll) to prescribe the global Mach number of the flow.
At the beginning of the simulation, we superimpose a wave packet in the lower non-sheared region of the base flow sketched in Fig. 1. The packet is constructed in spectral space containing solely wave mode harmonics. That is, it is void of vortex/potential vorticity perturbations. This packet is defined such that it has a specific amplitude and phase speed, which ensures that the initial packet travels in the positive shearwise direction (i.e., positive y-direction). Details of this construction are given in Sec. IV A. We then study the evolution of this packet as it interacts with the shear layer.
Within this setting, we use the constant shear parameter A = Mc_{s}/(2l + L) in the center sheared region to define the perturbation Mach number M as
where k_{x0} is the dominant streamwise wavenumber of the packet of perturbations (see Sec. III). Note that the perturbation Mach number can be interpreted as a gradient Mach number, where we have defined the streamwise length scale as 1/k_{x0}. It defines the ratio of the acoustic time scale, 1/k_{x0}c_{s}, and the flow time scale, 1/A, and as such characterizes the influence of compressibility effects on the acoustic perturbation [25,26]. Note furthermore that the term perturbation Mach number is not to be confused with the fluctuation/turbulent Mach number M_{t}, which is based on turbulent velocity fluctuations. As we are considering acoustic waves only, M_{t} ≈ 0 holds in all cases considered in this work.
We restrict our study to small values of M (0<M≤0.05) in order to be able to perform a linear stability analysis (see Sec. III). Still, it is a priori unclear how the non-linearly sheared regions affect the above-mentioned wave packets consisting of pure wave mode harmonics. We thus employ direct numerical simulations using the full Euler equations (see Sec. IV) to verify our results.
Using the above definitions, we have
which implies that convective Mach number is linked to the perturbation Mach number via the ratio of the flow length scale based the extent of the sheared region, (2l + L), and the acoustic length scale, 1/k_{x0}. Throughout this work, we choose the acoustic length scale to be much smaller than the flow length scale such that the wave packet has sufficient time to interact with the shear layer. Moreover, the acoustic length should not be larger than the size of the curved region, l, in order to be able to study its influence. As a result, we have k_{x0}(2l + L) ≫ 1 and the convective Mach number will always be much larger than the perturbation Mach number, i.e., M > 1.
As mentioned in the Introduction, the considered background flow profile (ϱ0,U0(y),0,P0){T} represents a strongly simplified model of a real jet flow. The following analysis will hence not be suitable for predicting noise generation in technically relevant applications. Choosing this base profile is thus motivated by the fact that even this minimalist setup exhibits a characteristic property of real jet flows, namely, the highly directed acoustic wave generation and propagation in the presence of dominating sources (cf. Sec. VI). In other words, we have deliberately chosen a simple model that allows us to analyze the linear mechanisms contributing to this phenomenon.
III. NON-MODAL ANALYSIS OF THE LINEARLY SHEARED REGION
As we study the propagation of acoustic waves in a 2D parallel unbounded inviscid plane shear flow, it is interesting to separately analyze the linear wave propagation behavior in the linearly sheared region of the mixing layer depicted in Fig. 1. We thus consider the base flow U_{0} = (Ay, 0) with a constant, shear parameter A > 0. Pressure, density, and velocity disturbances are denoted by p′, ϱ′, and u = (u_{x}, u_{y}), respectively. In the homentropic case, these disturbances are adiabatically compressible with a constant speed of sound c_{s} satisfying p^{′}=cs2ϱ^{′} [27]. In this limit, the linearized Euler equations have the form
where ϱ ≡ ϱ′/ϱ_{0}.
By simple manipulations on the set of partial differential equations (PDEs) (5), a linearized invariant of the system is derived,
This invariant is associated with the linearized potential vorticity (PV) as defined by Ertel and is conserved in the absence of friction and heating (see, e.g., Ref [28]). The PV plays a crucial role in the fundamental understanding of the nature of the disturbances. In fact, the system of PDEs (5) describes the dynamics of two types of perturbations, namely, vortices and acoustic waves. While the former are associated with nonzero PV, the latter are associated with zero PV. As our analysis targets the turning level of acoustic waves, we consider
exclusively. This condition ensures solely wave mode perturbations in the flow.
The acoustic wave solution of Eqs. (5) may be presented in terms of the Kelvin mode approach
with Ψ=ϱ,u_{x},u_{y} and ψ = {ρ, v_{x}, v_{y}}. This describes the transient dynamics of ψ with the streamwise wavenumber k_{x} and the time-dependent shearwise wavenumber k_{y}(t) = k_{y0} − Ak_{x}t. Here, k_{y0} is the initial (t = 0) shearwise wavenumber of the considered spatial Fourier harmonic (SFH), whereas k_{y}(t) is the shearwise wavenumber of the same SFH at time t.
Keeping in mind that k_{y}(t) = k_{y0} − Ak_{x}t, substituting Eq. (8) into (5) and (7) gives
and
The above equations can easily be reduced to the second order wave equation for v_{x}(t),
where
Defining v_{x} from Eq. (11), the remaining physical quantities can be calculated through
and
The close-form solution of Eq. (11) is given in Ref [29] and contains two acoustic waves with “instant” frequencies ω(k_{x}, k_{y}(t)) = ±c_{s}k(t), i.e., counter-propagating waves.
A. Wave trajectories in constantly sheared flows
From Eqs. (9), it is possible to the derive the wave trajectories in the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation [10,11], which shall be repeated here for completeness.
The spectral characteristics of acoustic wave SFHs are defined via Eqs. (11) and (12) such that
where the cases “±” relate to counter-propagating waves. This expression can be used to define the wave group velocity and trajectory of the harmonics. These properties only gain importance for wave packets when the ray theory (and thus the WKB approximation) is valid, i.e., when the coefficient ω^{2}(k_{x}, k_{y}(t)) in (11) is very large.
We restrict ourselves to the negative sign in Eq. (15) and analyze the trajectory of positive dispersion. The time-dependent wave group velocity is defined as
At t = 0, the group velocity is directed along the x-axis, and two rays are emitted in opposite directions along this axis. Acoustic waves propagate in a moving media with the total velocity U^{T}, which is equal to the vector sum of the wave group and the base flow velocities
The coordinates of the propagating wave-fronts are given by
Using Eqs. (16)–(18), one can rewrite the coordinates in the form
where k^{2}(t)=kx2+ky2(t). By eliminating t from the above equations, the ray trajectories are determined. These are illustrated in Fig. 2 for k_{x} = 1, k_{y} = 10, and A/(k_{x}c_{s}) = 0.05.
The time-dependent shearwise wavenumber k_{y}(t) = k_{y0} − Ak_{x}t changes its sign at the critical time t^{*} that relates to the maximum,
of Eq. (19b). This allows us to approximate the turning level in the framework of the Kelvin mode approach for the main wave SFH. We stress here that this approximation only holds in the WKB approximation.
B. Linear wave packet dynamics in a constantly sheared region
We visualize the propagation of acoustic waves in a linear shear flow using the example of a single wave packet that initially travels in the positive x- and y-direction. Using Matlab, we thus solve the system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) (9) numerically for a number of modes while excluding any non-linear interactions. That is, we consider a wave packet where we only keep one of the two counter-propagating waves in spectral space, for instance,
The embedded wave packet is defined by the velocity spectrum
where the function G(k, k_{0}) defines the packet geometry in the k-plane according to
A detailed derivation of the associated initial conditions is given in the Appendix.
A similar analysis has been conducted in Ref [10] for initially pure vortex packets. The following set of parameters is appropriate to visualize the linear wave propagation: A = 0.07, c_{s} = 1, k_{x0} = 0.15π, k_{y0} = 4k_{x0}, k_{R} = 0.05π, and ϵ = 10^{−1}. The localized packet is thus initially located around (k_{x0}, k_{y0}) in the spectral plane and (x, y) = (−120, 0) in the physical plane. Note that the resulting perturbation Mach number, M=0.15, is relatively high and has been chosen for visualization purposes only. The dynamics of each harmonic inside the packet is solved in the spectral plane using the Matlab’s ODE solver. In order to ensure a smooth visualization of the packet dynamics in both spectral and physical planes, 1024 modes in each direction have been used, employing the fast Fourier transform (FFT) for the inverse transformation. The packet’s propagation dynamics in the spectral and physical planes at six different times normalized on the critical time t^{*} = k_{y0}/(Ak_{x0}) is presented in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively. Furthermore, the trajectory calculated for the main wave harmonic (k_{x0}, k_{y0}) is superimposed in Fig. 4.
It is known from linear analysis [10,30] that the wave mode will not undergo any conversion into another mode for homentropic shear flows. However, it will either emit or gain energy from the surrounding base flow depending on the wavenumber ratio k_{y}(t)/k_{x} (cf. ODE solution in Fig. 8). We distinguish between two cases: If k_{y}(t)/k_{x} > 0, the wave mode harmonic gives energy back to the base flow, whereas for k_{y}(t)/k_{x} < 0 it gains energy and amplifies algebraically (for A > 0).
The initially imposed wave packet of the form (23) stays compact for all times in physical as well as in spectral space, however, constantly changing its shape due to the changing wavenumber k_{y}(t). The reason is found in the different speeds when considering a range of modes located along the k_{x}-axis, which is proportional to −Ak_{x}. When the center of the packet [i.e., the geometrical center in the spectral plane, cf. Fig. 3(c)] reaches the critical time t = t^{*}, its propagation in the shearwise direction is interrupted [cf. Fig. 4(c)]. This means that the wave packet is not able to penetrate through a, one can say, critical layer in the y-direction. For t > t^{*}, the packet continues its drift in spectral space (see Fig. 3), while following the predicted trajectory in physical space. The wave packet becomes highly down-shear tilted in time and travels exclusively in the negative y-direction [see Figs. 4(d)–4(f)].
IV. NUMERICAL SETUP FOR THE NON-LINEARLY SHEARED CASE
In the light of results obtained in Sec. III, we now return to the non-linear shear layer introduced in Sec. II (cf. Fig. 1). That is, we simulate the evolution of wave packets consisting of small amplitude perturbations in a non-linearly sheared flow. These perturbations are specifically constructed such that their linearized (potential) vorticity is zero before interacting with the sheared flow. Here, we have to pay particular attention to the non-linearly sheared regions, where it is not a priori clear if the wave packet retains its properties. In order to verify the validity of this assumption, we perform these direct numerical simulations using the full (nonlinear) Euler equations, even though the considered range of perturbation Mach numbers is in the linear regime.
A. Initial conditions
At time t = 0, we superimpose a wave packet in the lower, non-sheared region of the base flow sketched in Fig. 1. Using definitions (23) and (24), the packet is constructed in spectral space such that it solely contains wave mode harmonics. Moreover, this packet has a specific amplitude and phase speed such that the initial packet to travel in the positive shearwise direction. Thereby, we ensure that it does not partially leave the domain in the negative shearwise direction. In order to ensure small numerical errors due to the inverse FFT, we choose the lower part of the numerical domain to be symmetric and to have 2^{n},n∈N{+} number of points in each direction. We ensure pure wave mode perturbations in the system by demanding that the linearized (potential) vorticity of the perturbations is always zero,
The initial conditions in terms of the primitive perturbation variables are hence a special case of the initial conditions provided in the Appendix for a wave packet embedded in a linear shear flow, i.e., A = 0. We stress here that the perturbations are constructed just for the right half plane (k_{x} > 0) in spectral space, as the left half plane (k_{x} < 0) can be easily reconstructed [31].
The packet consists of two oval shaped localization areas whose size is defined by k_{R} and whose centers are situated at (k_{x0}, k_{y0}) = (1, 6) and (−k_{x0}, −k_{y0}), respectively. The initial disturbance amplitude is defined via the parameter ϵ. Figure 5 shows a zoom into the relevant parts in spectral space and physical space. Note that the remainder of the domains is free of any perturbations.
The chosen configuration allows the packet to enter the curved region freely, without being influenced by artificially imposed initial conditions. The dynamics of the considered wave packet is dictated by the ratio of A/(|k_{x}|c_{s})k_{y}/k_{x}. As a result, a wave packet traveling in the negative y-direction which is initially located inside in the upper constant region of the shear-layer would follow exactly the same dynamics. This can be seen from the fact that the aforementioned ratio is the same if k_{y}/k_{x}and the shear rate are changed in sign simultaneously. This renders the analysis applicable to any shear region inside a plane jet flow, at least if the extent of the curved regions is small.
B. Numerical discretization
In the right part of Fig. 1, we present a sketch of the computational domain. Its size is denoted by L_{x} and L_{y} in the streamwise and shearwise directions, respectively. The layer is contained in a computational box with periodic boundary conditions applied in the streamwise direction, whereas non-reflecting boundary conditions are applied in the shearwise direction. These allow waves to exit the domain without any spurious reflections, which otherwise might corrupt the results.
We choose L_{x} = 1 such that the horizontal extent is large enough to avoid aliasing phenomena due to periodicity. Beside the advantages in terms of computational costs, the use of periodic conditions along the main flow directions offers technical advantages, regarding (i) the uncertainty associated with the inflow/outflow boundary conditions and (ii) the acoustic far-field evolution can be undoubtedly linked to the dynamical events in the shear region [32]—the imposed acoustic wave packet propagates mainly in the y-direction. A comparably large size L_{y} = 4 × L_{x} = 4 × L is chosen in the y-direction such that the individual subregions (lower unsheared, linearly sheared and upper unsheared) are large enough to fully contain the wave packets, even after they have been distorted by the action of shear. Since we are mainly interested in the influence of the curved regions, we arbitrarily set L = 1 and vary l to tune the size ratio.
The numerical simulation of the considered flow configuration is challenging because (i) the amplitude of the perturbations in the wave packets is extremely small (|ρ′/ρ_{0}| ≈ 10^{−6}); (ii) we want to track wave packets for long periods of time in order to study their temporal dynamics. As a consequence, we need to employ a numerical discretization scheme that guarantees small dissipation and dispersion errors in order to ensure that the conclusions are independent of the numerical discretization. We thus solve the full non-linear Euler equations for an ideal gas (γ = 1.4) in conservative form utilizing the higher-order Runge-Kutta Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretization within the BoSSS (Bounded Support Spectral Solver) framework [33]. Numerical fluxes are computed using the Harten-Lax-Leer-Contact (HLLC) flux [34] where wave speeds are chosen according to Batten et_al [35] The resulting DG discretization strictly conserves mass, momentum, and total energy.
Moreover, we are interested in very narrow curved regions (i.e., l/L ≪ 1), which implies that the strong gradients in the regions y ∈ [−l, 0] and y ∈ [L, L + l] need to be resolved accurately. Our numerical discretization consequently uses N_{x} × N_{y} = 256 × 1024 equidistant grid cells and 6-th order polynomials, which leads to approximately 7 × 10^{6} unknowns per variable.
In time, we choose a standard fourth order Runge-Kutta scheme [36]. To fulfill the Courant-Friedrichs-Levy (CFL) stability criterion of the fully discrete Runge-Kutta DG discretization, a time step size of Δt = 2 × 10^{−5} is required. It was verified that the numerical solution does not change when further decreasing the time step size. This setup is suitable to follow the temporal dynamics in physical as well as spectral space and has been compared to the exact solution given by Hau, Oberlack, and Chagelishvili [29] in terms of special functions inside the linearly sheared region of the shear-layer (presented in Fig. 8).
If the wave packet reaches the outflow boundaries, we apply a sponge layer that extends from y ∈ [2, 2.5]. Inside this region, the quadratic damping-function
with s = (y − 2)/(2.5 − 2) is introduced on the right-hand side of the Euler equations. It has been shown by Richards et_al [37] and Mani [38] that such a smooth sponge layer is sufficient to reduce unphysical reflections of waves exiting the computational domain.
C. Simulated cases
Table I summarizes the parameters of the performed DNS. We concentrate on the influence of the gradient/perturbation Mach number and the curved region. In order to investigate the influence of the curved region, we additionally vary its extent in the y-direction via the parameter l. The ratio l/l_{packet} ∝ lk(0)/2π with k(0)=kx02+ky02 allows us to compare the length scales of the curved region and the imposed packet. Moreover, it is practical control M via the shear parameter because varying k_{x} influences Mand the length scale ratio lk(0)/2π simultaneously [cf. Eq. (3)]. Having fixed this length scale ratio, M and M become equivalent measures characterize to flow conditions [cf. Eq. (4)].
From the insights gained by Hau [11] for the linear dynamics of wave packets in a constantly sheared base flow, we estimate—neglecting the influence of the curved region in a first approximation—whether the wave packet (i) passes the linearly sheared region, (ii) is split into two oppositely propagating ones, or (iii) is even not able to pass through the shear-layer, i.e., is redirected/“reflected” and follows the trajectory presented in Eq. (19). While keeping the ratio of the length scales of the wave packet and the curved regions (l × k/(2π)) constant, the first three cases C1-C3 are chosen such that the above-mentioned phenomena occur: In case C1, the packet is predicted to being not able to pass through the shear-layer, as the turning level y^{*} (in terms of the Kelvin mode approach) lies inside the sheared region. In case C2, the packet reaches the upper curved region where it is about to change its direction of propagation in the y-direction. In case C3, the critical time t^{*} cannot be reached by the packet’s bulk wavenumber. Hence, it should pass through the shear-layer. The location of the turning level is derived according to the approximation given in Eq. (20). We stress that this does not relate to the definition of a turning level as in the framework of the modal analysis.
Cases C3–C6 are of interest for studying the influence of the curved region. In these cases, the convective Mach number M and the perturbation Mach number M defined by the linearly sheared region are kept fixed, while the length scale of the curved regions l is changed.
V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The DNS results of the wave packet dynamics are presented in spectral space and physical space. Here, the analysis in spectral space allows for a simple description of the interplay between the packet and the base flow. During the analysis, we will first focus on the influence of the perturbation Mach number (cases C1-C3), followed by an analysis of the influence of the curved regions on the wave packet dynamics (cases C3-C6).
A. Influence of the perturbation Mach number—C1-C3
The perturbation Mach number M=A/(k_{x0}c_{s}) is determined by the center of the packet in spectral space. Here, the shear parameter A inside the linearly sheared region of size L (see Fig. 1) is varied, whereas the size of the curved region l is kept constant. We estimate the critical time and the connected turning level y^{*} of the packet on the basis of its trajectory inside the linearly sheared region y ∈ [0, 1] according to Eq. (20). These estimates are given in Table I for the corresponding cases. As the length ratio of the imposed wave packet and the curved region is approximately equal to one for the three considered cases, its influence is negligible. As a result, one can expect that the dynamics resemble the ones presented in Sec. III B, at least for C1. The reason for this is that y^{*} ≲ L, i.e., the level (and moment in time) where the packet changes its direction in the shearwise direction, lies inside the constantly sheared region. We present the dynamics for C1 in Figs. 6 and 7 in the physical space and spectral space, respectively. Here, we focus on times t ≥ 0.8 because the wave packet simply travels upward at constant group velocity before reaching sheared regions.
As expected, following the dynamics either in spectral space or physical space, we observe coincidence with the dynamics illustrated in Figs. 3 and 4. In particular, the dynamics in spectral space follow the discussed drift along the k_{y}-axis, while they stay confined along the k_{x}-axis. At t = 2, the packet crosses the line k_{y} = 0 (Fig. 7), which relates to the instance when the packet’s phase lines are orthogonal to the streamwise direction (Fig. 6). Due to the (minimum) influence of the curved region located around y = 0, the packet is slightly distorted but still follows the predicted path and travels toward the negative y-direction again (t > 2.3). In the spectral plane, this relates to a continuing drift along the k_{y}-axis, which is interrupted as soon as the packet leaves the sheared region and enters the region of the uniform (in this case zero velocity) flow.
Plotting the evolution of the packet’s energy (see Fig. 8, solid) that is defined in the usual manner as E(t)=12(|u_{x}|^{2}+|u_{y}|^{2}+|ϱ^{′}|^{2}), together with the energy calculated on the basis of the exact solution of the linear ordinary differential equations in terms of the streamwise perturbation velocity given by Ref [29] (dotted), we observe that the curves collapse. Specifically, the packet gives energy back to the base flow as long as it is up-shear tilted and algebraically amplifies when it is down-shear tilted. Naturally, there is some small deviation when the packet enters the curved region. This smooth region is not considered in the exact solution of the system of ODEs that solely describes the dynamics for constantly sheared flows.
Next, we consider the case C2, which is of special interest because the turning level is estimated to lie close to the upper boundary of the constantly sheared region. Due to the fact that the curved, non-linear region is extremely narrow, the packet is effectively under the action of two different base flows: For y ≲ L, the packet further interacts with a constantly sheared base flow, whereas it is simply convected for y ≳ L. The dynamics in either plane are presented in Figs. 9–11.
As long as the packet resides inside the linearly sheared region (t ≲ 2.2), the dynamics are identical to C1, both in physical space and spectral space. However, the packet starts to split for larger times (t = 2.4) as it has two different group velocities in the shearwise direction. While the upper part of the packet travels outside of the sheared region, the lower follows the same dynamics as the one presented in Fig. 6. This becomes even more apparent in Fig. 10, where an extended domain is presented at later instances in time in order to capture the strong stretching of the wave packet. In accordance with theory, the upper packet maintains its energy as it is just convected. The lower packet, however, is still under the influence of the shear [for t > t^{*} ≈ k_{y0}/(Ak_{x0})] and thus able to extract energy from the base flow. This algebraic amplification can clearly be observed in Fig. 8 (dashed line). The associated picture in the spectral plane also captures the splitting of the wave packet and underlines the fact that the waves leaving the sheared region maintain their shape and location. In other words, the drift, and hence the influence of the shear, stops. At the same time, the packet remaining in the sheared region continues its drift along the k_{y}-axis and thereby amplifies. This is especially obvious when comparing the times t = 2.4 and t = 3.0 in Fig. 11. For the former moment in time, the packet located in the region of k_{y}/k_{x} > 0 has a higher amplitude. Yet, the amplitude of the modes at k_{y}/k_{x} < 0 finally dominates.
Obviously, the two different curved regions have different impacts on the perturbations entering or leaving the shear-layer, respectively. If the length scales of the perturbation and the curved region are comparable, the packet will most definitely be able to enter the sheared region. Here, the reason is the positive, increasing gradient of the base velocity profile: as soon as a part of the wave packet enters the shear, this part will follow the dynamics described in Sec. III B, whereas the part that still resides in the uniform region travels in the positive shearwise direction. In contrast, the gradient of the base velocity profile in the vicinity of the upper curved region decreases. So, the upper part of the wave packet entering the uniform region propagates with a group velocity that changes slower than the one of the lower part, whose drift velocity in spectral space is considerably faster. This leads to a possible change of its direction of propagation in the shearwise direction if the critical time can be reached—the packet splits into two. Such a scenario is clearly not possible in the lower curved region for the considered base flow profile.
Next, we will consider case C3, where the perturbation Mach number has been further reduced (see Table I). The respective plots in the physical and spectral planes are presented in Figs. 12 and 13.
For case C3, we observe (cf. Fig. 12) that the wave packet passes through the shear-layer, while its wavenumber ratio k_{y}/k_{x} continuously changes in time (see Fig. 13). As long as the packet is under the action of shear, it is turned around its own axis. Yet, it stays up-shear tilted because the drift is interrupted at the time the packet leaves the linearly sheared region. This is in agreement with the trend observed for cases C1-C2, namely, that a decreasing perturbation Mach number M allows the wave packet to propagate further in the shearwise direction.
B. Influence of the curved region—C3-C6
The parameters for the cases C3-C6 are identical (cf. Table I), except for the length of the curved region. We stress that the convective Mach number M is kept constant. We estimate the turning level of all cases to lie outside the shear-layer, so that any packet is assumed to be able to pass through, reaching the boundary of the computational domain. The purpose of this set of simulations is to demonstrate the influence of the curved regions on the dynamics on the packet, thereby addressing the question what happens when the ratio lk/2π is increased.
The packet’s geometry is identical for cases C3-C6 and thus not presented here. We rather refer to Figs. 12 and 13. Instead, we compare the temporal energy evolution for the four cases in Fig. 14. This reveals the influence of the curved region and the reason why the geometry of the corresponding packets is identical at any time. Although the inclination of the energy loss of the localized wave packet is changed, the final levels are identical, leading to the independence of the size of the curved region. The wave packet looses about 50% of its initial energy when residing inside the sheared regions.
As discussed, the wave packet passes through the shear-layer for any of the cases C3-C6 and is finally simply convected by the uniform mean flow. One can approximate the mean shear for all four cases as A¯{i}=M_{i}c_{s}/(L+2l), for i = 3, …, 6, stressing the importance of the temporal dynamics in analyzing linear phenomena in shear flows: As the shear rate A_{i} is gradually reduced from C3 to C6 and, at the same time, the shearwise extent of the sheared areas is extended, the packet is under the action of shear for a longer time. In fact, this results in the packets having the same specifications when leaving the shear-layer and the outer observer will experience the same amplitude of sound/noise.
VI. CONCLUSION
Understanding how waves evolve in sheared flows has attracted the interest of generations of scientists (see, e.g., Refs [8] and  [39–47]). We investigate the dynamics of an initially imposed packet of wave SFHs in a shear-layer by means of DNS. On one hand, this problem setup allows to verify the results obtained by the purely linear analysis conducted in Ref [11]. On the other hand, we also gain further insights into the wave dynamics in a more realistic flow configuration. Bogey, Bailly, and Juvé [48] considered a similar problem setup, however, using a monopolar source that is located in the lower uniform flow region, instead of a directed wave packet with SFHs having wavenumber ratios of k_{y}(0)/k_{x} > 0. They show that the shear-layer is responsible for the redirection of the waves emitted by the source. However, by taking into account waves with positive as well as negative wavenumber ratios, it is difficult to point to the exact physical mechanism at work.
In the present work, we analyzed the dynamics of an initially up-shear tilted wave packet in spectral space and physical space with the small perturbation Mach number of the main harmonic with (k_{x0}, k(y0)) initially. The linear drift along the shearwise wavenumber axis is the key process and the critical time of the main bulk of perturbations is the time scale of importance. The time-dependence of k(t) = (k_{x}, k_{y} − Ak_{x}t), caused by the shearing of each harmonic due to the background flow, is well acknowledged by the hydrodynamic stability community. One can say that each SFH “drifts” in the wavenumber plane along the k_{y}-axis with the velocity −Ak_{x}. Based on the estimation of the critical time, we have set up three different scenarios: the packet (i) propagates through the shear-layer, (ii) is split at its upper border, or (iii) is not able to penetrate through the shear flow. We have shown that the key parameters are the perturbation Mach number and the time the packet resides inside the sheared region. Specifically, the investigated cases C1-C3 demonstrate the importance of the non-dimensional perturbation Mach number M=A/(k_{x0}c_{s}), which relates the streamwise wavenumber of the bulk of perturbations, the constant shear parameter A in the interval y ∈ [0, L], and the speed of sound c_{s} with each other. At least for small curved regions (l≪L), this ratio determines if waves (i) are able to pass through a shear-layer, (ii) are split at its upper border, or (iii) are “reflected.” We stress that they indeed smoothly change their direction of propagation in all cases.
The simulations are in agreement with the overall picture of the simulation results presented in Refs [49] and  [50], who used a large-scale structure with specific frequency inside the shear-layer to generate waves. They noticed that the observed Mach wave radiation does not occur for large-scale subsonic sound sources. This is partially confirmed by the analysis conducted in Refs [10] and  [30]. In fact, the linear mechanism of wave generation is strong for the moderate (i.e., also subsonic) Mach numbers of the perturbations [10]. The reason for this partial disagreement is found in the definition of the Mach number used by Avital, Sandham, and Luo [49]. This definition assumes a constant frequency and consequently ignores the time-dependence of the wavenumber, which is misleading in the context of the present work.
Further, the influence of the curved region has been analyzed. For the considered length scale ratios between the size of the imposed packet and the shearwise extent of the curved regions, lk/2π > 1, the curved regions can be considered to have similar influence as the constantly sheared region. By comparing the energy evolution for the four cases under consideration (C3-C6), we conclude that it is feasible to average the shear rate over its extent in the y-direction (taking into account the convective Mach number) in order to estimate the dynamics in the linear regime.
Taking into account the results presented by Hau [11], we can summarize that the sheared regions are responsible for highly directed acoustic wave generation and propagation if there is a dominating source, as it is the case for jet flows (see, e.g., Refs [21] and  [51–56]). The discussed importance/dominance of linear sources of aerodynamic sound generation in shear flows, which lead to highly directive linearly generated waves by vortices (initially all linearly generated waves have the zero shearwise wavenumber), is substantiated by peculiar wave packet dynamics. We have shown that the wave packet’s direction is altered in any of the three sheared regions. Moreover, only waves that are tilted up-shear when A > 0 (i.e., when A|k_{x}|c_{s}k_{y}k_{x}>0) can change their shearwise direction of propagation. This means that any wave perturbation that is generated inside the sheared region (e.g., of a jet) is not able to change in this way because the shearwise wavenumber of the SFH is zero at the moment of its generation. Yet, it follows the predicted trajectories. There is no linear mechanism that might redirect a down-shear tilted wave perturbation in the opposite shearwise direction, if the direction of shear is fixed [57].
Returning to the results presented by Bogey, Bailly, and Juvé [48], it is clear that upstream traveling waves can be attributed to waves that have both, a negative wavenumber ratio and a negative streamwise component of the group velocity. Those waves amplify as A|k_{x}|c_{s}k_{y}k_{x}<0, whereas waves with a positive wavenumber ratio lose energy. Ergo, it is not surprising that the upstream traveling waves presented in Fig. 2 in Ref [48] are stronger than the downstream traveling ones. Moreover, they present in Fig. 4 the prediction by Lighthill’s AA. Comparing this with either Fig. 2 or Fig. 3 of their publication, it is apparent that non-normality/mean shear induced phenomena are not taken into account properly, confirming the discussion given in Ref [11].
APPENDIX: SINGLE WAVE PACKET
In the following, we derive the initial conditions used in Secs. III and IV for the numerical simulation of a packet of wave harmonics, which travels solely in either the negative or the positive shearwise direction.
The linearized compressible Euler equations in spectral space are given by (9). In order to ensure pure wave mode perturbations in the system, we demand that the PV is always zero,
Note that this condition is identical to
We now define the following non-dimensional parameters:
By applying these, Eqs. (9) can be rewritten as
with potential vorticity
i.e., W=0 and K(τ)=Kx2+Ky2(τ).
We further define the quantities
and combine the above equations for Ψ_{1} and Ψ_{2} in two different manners to obtain
Combining Eq. (A10) with the relation
yields
Furthermore, combining Eqs. (A9) and (A11) yields
As a result, Eq. (A12) can be written solely in terms of Ψ_{1} and Ψ_{2},
Regarding ṽ{x}, this implies
which includes both Ψ_{1} and Ψ_{2}. However, their contributions can be separated from each other,
From Eqs. (A11) and (A13), we derive the equivalent formulation
for ṽ{y}. It is now possible to assign either Ψ_{1} or Ψ_{2} to D and subsequently derive the remaining velocities that relate to W=0. Accordingly, setting Ψ_{1} = 0 restricts the direction of the group velocity of the perturbation to one and we obtain
Finally, converting back into the original system of variables and with assuming that Ψ_{2} = Ψ^{(+)}e^{iφ}, the initial conditions are given by
Substituting Eqs. (A21b) and (A21c) into (A2) results in equality, thus showing the correctness of the described derivation.
Note that the resulting initial condition only holds for the right half plane (k_{x} > 0) in spectral space. Accordingly, one needs to recover the left half plane (k_{x} < 0) in order to end up with a real-valued inverse Fourier transformation. We achieve this using the approach presented by Briggs [31].
