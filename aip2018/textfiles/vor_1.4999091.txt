Optimum-wavelength forcing of a bluff body wake
Three-dimensional forcing of the wake of a circular cylinder was studied experimentally to determine the optimal spatial-forcing-wavelength for drag reduction. Dielectric-barrier-discharge plasma actuators were mounted on a cylinder in a square-wave pattern to create the three-dimensional forcing. Six spatial wavelengths (1d–6d) and two blowing ratios (U_{j}/U_{∞} = 0.2 and 0.6) were tested at a Reynolds number of 4700. For most spatial wavelengths and blowing ratios, the segmented plasma actuators produced streamwise vorticity that altered the wake development, formation length, and drag. A spatial wavelength of 4d emerged as the optimum wavelength for the high-blowing-ratio case. Forcing with this optimum wavelength significantly attenuated vortex shedding, leading to maximum drag reduction in the high-blowing-ratio case. This optimum wavelength of 4d exists because longer wavelengths reduce the spatial extent of induced velocity and shorter wavelengths inhibit the development of streamwise vorticity.
I. INTRODUCTION
The spatio-temporal structure of a circular cylinder wake is dominated by the Kármán vortex street as the primary instability, with secondary instabilities having a critical role in the transition and development of the cylinder wake. Two kinds of secondary instabilities, mode-A and mode-B structures [1], are predominantly streamwise vortices with spanwise wavelengths of λ/d ≈ 4 and λ/d ≈ 1 (d = diameter of cylinder), respectively. Mode-A appears in the range of Reynolds numbers (Re) of 180–194, and with increasing Re, it is replaced by mode-B at Re = 230–260. Both of these structures connect two consecutive spanwise vortices. In mode-A structures, the sign of vorticity changes after every half shedding cycle, whereas in mode-B structures, the sense of rotation is retained [1]. Excitation of these secondary instabilities by spanwise non-uniform forcing can effectively divert vorticity from the primary Kármán instability and attenuate its strength [2]. A number of experimental and numerical studies demonstrated the benefit of such three-dimensional (3D) forcing [3]. Some notable efforts include the use of a wavy trailing-edge [4] at Re = 2 × 10^{4}–6 × 10^{4}; spanwise tabs at Re = 2 × 10^{4}, 4 × 10^{4}, and 8 × 10^{4} with λ/h = 0.42–2.5, where h was the body height [5]; and a segmented trailing edge [6] at Re = 1000 and 3.2 × 10^{5}, where significant drag reduction was reported due to the imposed three-dimensionality on the flow. Bearman and Owen [7] investigated the flow over a bluff-body with a wavy leading-edge at a Re of 4 × 10^{4} and noted that even a mild disturbance with a wavelength of λ/d ≈ 5.6 completely suppresses vortex shedding. This finding inspired Darekar and Sherwin [8] to carry out a numerical simulation with a square cylinder having wavy leading- and trailing-edges, although at a much lower Re of 100. They too reported significant suppression of vortex shedding at λ/d ≈ 5.6 and concluded that this particular wavelength was actually forcing mode-A structures in the wake, thereby diverting circulation from the spanwise vortices. Their findings suggested that the optimum spanwise wavelength of active forcing likely matches the characteristic wavelength of a secondary instability. In a similar numerical simulation, Kim and Choi [9] used spanwise-varying active blowing and suction from slots located at ±90° from the forward stagnation point of a cylinder. They used a wavelength of λ/d = π at Re = 3900 and reported 25% drag reduction. However, a parametric study of spanwise wavelength was not conducted at this Re, so it is not known whether λ/d = π is an optimum wavelength. Poncet et_al [10] conducted an optimization study in conjunction with direct numerical simulation of flow over a cylinder with prescribed tangential blowing from the surface. They demonstrated that at Re = 300, the optimum wavelengths correspond to both modes A and B. Later, they used these optimum parameters at Re = 1000 and observed significant drag reduction. A similar reduction of drag in the wake of a blunt trailing edge profiled body under distributed forcing was also reported by Naghib-Lahouti, Hangan, and Lavoie [11], but they too pre-selected the forcing-wavelength based on the results of a numerical study.
As discussed earlier, most of the studies on cylinder wakes that attempted to determine an optimum wavelength performed parametric studies at lower Re’s and then extended those results to a more turbulent regime, leaving a few questions unanswered: First, what is the true optimum wavelength of forcing in a turbulent regime? Dobre, Hangan, and Vickery [2] speculated that mode-A might be the most efficient for control purposes as it is associated with elliptic instability. This speculation was not, however, backed with experimental results. Hence, the present work can also be regarded as an extensive study to document the optimality of mode A in a turbulent wake regime. Another question revolves around whether the flow characteristics generated by optimum-wavelength forcing match the characteristics of the associated mode (i.e., λ/d = 4 for mode A or λ/d = 1 for mode B). To address these questions, this experimental study implements square-wave-shaped dielectric-barrier-discharge (DBD) plasma actuators on a cylinder directly in the turbulent regime (Re = 4700). Six wavelengths, ranging from λ/d = 1 to 6, were tested along with two blowing ratios with a jet velocity at 20% and 60% of the freestream velocity. This work clearly documents the optimum wavelength for forcing in the turbulent wake regime and the reasons for that optimal condition.
II. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS
A. Wind tunnel and cylinder model
All experiments were performed in a closed-return type, low-speed wind tunnel with a cross section of 0.6 m × 1.22 m, at The Ohio State University. The variation in the flow uniformity in a vertical plane (yz) in the test section was measured using a pitot tube and was less than 1%. The turbulence intensity of the freestream was less than 0.5%. Plexiglass tubing with an outer diameter (d) of 25.4 mm and an aspect ratio of 20 was used as cylinder models. The z-axis of the coordinate system coincided with the axis of the cylinder model, and the x-axis was placed along the direction of the freestream flow. The cylinder was located 0.6 m from the end of the contraction section, and end-plates, modeled after Stansby [12], were mounted at both ends to minimize the effects of the side-walls. All tests were carried out at a Re of 4700, based on d and a freestream velocity, U_{∞} = 3 ± 0.1 m/s, which was monitored by a pitot tube connected to an electronic manometer (Datametrics, Dresser).
B. Plasma actuator construction and operation
The exposed and buried electrodes of the DBD actuators [Fig. 1(a)] were made of copper tape (thickness: 0.0029d or 0.074 mm) with two layers of Kapton tape as the dielectric material between them (total thickness: 0.007d or 0.18 mm). Two sets of actuators were mounted: one at +80° from the forward stagnation point and the other at −80° [Fig. 1(b)]. These azimuthal locations were selected based on an actuation sensitivity study [13]. In each set of actuators, the exposed electrode (0.25d wide) covered the entire span (20d); the buried electrodes, each 0.5d wide, were mounted on the surface at regular intervals, as per the required wavelength (λ). The downstream regions in the wake, directly behind the buried electrodes, were called the plasma regions [Fig. 1(c)]. Similarly, the no-plasma regions were located behind spanwise locations with no buried electrodes. The DBD actuators were driven in-phase by a 5-kHz sine wave from a function generator (Agilent 33220A). As this frequency was several orders of magnitude higher than the shedding frequency (23 Hz), the forcing may be considered quasi-steady. The amplitude of the driving sine wave was varied to change the induced jet velocity (U_{j}) from the DBD actuators, and it was measured with a pitot tube to determine the blowing ratio, BR = U_{j}/U_{∞}. This measurement was repeated at multiple locations on three adjacent buried electrodes to obtain the mean BR [13]. Two distinct blowing ratios, BR = 0.2 and BR = 0.6, were used in this work. As reported in the work of Bhattacharya and Gregory [13] (Fig. 2 of that paper), these two BRs were located on either side of a threshold BR, above which vortex shedding begins to be affected. Following this observation, the induced velocities of the actuators were matched in each of the two cases.
C. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements
Instantaneous velocity fields in the horizontal (xz) and transverse (yz) planes were acquired using PIV [Fig. 1(c)]. A double-pulsed Nd-YAG laser (Quantel Corp.) illuminated the flow field seeded with liquid droplets of DEHS [di(2-ethylhexyl) sebacate] fluid, and a pco.1600 CCD camera (resolution of 1600 × 1200 pixels) captured 500 pairs of images at a frame rate of 10 Hz. After saving these image pairs to the computer, images were recaptured at the same flow conditions. This was repeated until 2000 image pairs were obtained, which were later used for time-averaging. The time separation between the pulses was 700 μs. DaVis PIV software (LaVision) was used to synchronize the camera and the laser and also for final vector processing. During each PIV run, a background image was obtained with no flow in the tunnel and with the plasma actuators on. The background image was later subtracted from the acquired images. To account for the perspective errors caused by the out of plane velocity components in the yz plane, images were also obtained in an empty tunnel running at U_{∞}. The average V and W velocities were treated as bias errors and later subtracted from the vector fields obtained in the yz plane.
D. Hot-wire anemometry
Velocity signals were acquired using two X-wire sensors connected to a multi-channel hot-wire anemometer system (Dantec Dynamics). One of the X-wire sensors was positioned directly downstream of the center of a no-plasma region, while the other X-wire was held directly downstream of the center of a plasma region [Fig. 1(c)]. The outputs of the anemometers were sampled simultaneously with an A/D board (NI-PCIe-6251) at a sampling frequency of 50 kHz for a minimum of 5 s (sufficient to ensure convergence of statistics: 115 vortex shedding cycles were recorded at a characteristic shedding frequency, f_{st}, of 23 Hz). The X-wires were calibrated in situ using a look-up table [14]. The uncertainty in the velocity measurement was estimated to be ±0.1 m/s (assuming 95% confidence).
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In this section, we first identify the optimum wavelength for forcing with BR = 0.6, at Re = 4700 based on the velocity power spectra (Sec. III A) and drag-measurement results (Sec. III B). Thereafter, vorticity plots from PIV experiments at the same blowing ratio are used to detect the orientation of the streamwise structures (Sec. III C), followed by a comparison of these structures between the BR = 0.2 and BR = 0.6 cases (Sec. III D). Finally, streamline traces obtained in the xz plane are used to distinguish the optimum wavelength from the rest.
A. Velocity power spectra
The impact of forcing with BR = 0.6 on vortex shedding is illustrated through the velocity power spectra shown in Fig. 2. The spectra were generated from the transverse velocity fluctuation (v′) data obtained by hot wire. The axis label, λ/d = 0, denotes the unforced case, and the sharp peak (at f/f_{st} = 1) in this spectrum corresponds to vortex shedding, whose frequency (23 Hz) was much lower than the plasma actuation frequency (5 kHz) resulting in a quasi-steady forcing. Forcing has no significant effect on the shedding-peak for λ/d = 1 and λ/d = 2. For λ/d = 3, shedding is considerably attenuated, but the degree of attenuation is mostly in the no-plasma region. Similar differential behavior is evident for λ/d = 5, where the height of the shedding-peak in the no-plasma region is higher than that in the plasma region. Moreover, the spectra obtained in the plasma-region display double peaks, which signify a bi-modal state of the wake. This phenomenon was confirmed by using short-time-Fourier-transform analysis (see Fig. 3), which revealed that both of these peaks existed simultaneously in the plasma region. [Note that the short-time-Fourier-transform (STFT) was plotted using a different procedure (spectrogram) as compared to the spectra in Fig. 2, which used Welch’s method. Hence the amplitude scales are different due to different normalizing factors.] For λ/d = 6, in Fig. 2, stronger peaks are visible in both the plasma and no-plasma regions. The shedding peak in the plasma region, however, is located at f/f_{st} = 1.13, whereas in the no-plasma region it is located at f/f_{st} = 0.93, indicating different wake formation lengths (wake formation length is the distance required for full formation of the vortex before shedding, indicated by the maximum v′ point from the center of the cylinder). Moreover, the forcing seemed to lose its effectiveness at this wavelength as the peak heights started to grow again, approaching the unforced values. Shedding was significantly suppressed in front of both the plasma and no-plasma regions only for λ/d = 4, where the shedding frequencies in the plasma and no-plasma regions are f/f_{st} = 0.8 and 0.73, respectively. Similar observations held true at other downstream measurement locations; therefore, the maximum suppression of vortex shedding by forcing at λ/d = 4 was by no means a local phenomenon.
B. Drag measurements
The X-wire velocity profiles were acquired at x/d = 40 to estimate the total drag in the BR = 0.6 case. Figure 4 shows that from λ/d = 4 onwards, the velocity defect in the plasma region is lower than that in the no-plasma region causing a wider wake in the no-plasma region. This particular feature, which is more prominent for λ/d = 5 and 6, indicates that the forcing attenuates the vortex shedding more in the plasma region and thus creates a region with a smaller velocity defect. Two separate C_{D} values were obtained by numerically integrating the profiles [15] in the plasma and the no-plasma regions, and they were averaged to give the final C_{D} (Fig. 5). This approach was verified by acquiring velocity profiles at other spanwise locations for one of the actuators (λ/d = 6), which revealed no substantial difference in C_{D} after spanwise averaging (Fig. 74 in Appendix C of Bhattacharya [16]). In Fig. 5, the C_{D} values show a gradual decrease of drag after λ/d = 1 up to λ/d = 4, indicating increasing success of segmented forcing. Above λ/d = 4, this process is reversed, which can be attributed to the widening velocity profiles behind the no-plasma region, contributing to a larger C_{D} in the final average. Thus, the trend line indicates a clear minimum at λ/d = 4. The increase in the drag for λ/d = 1 was not investigated further. It is important to note, however, that the closely packed actuators in this case created a near two-dimensional forcing, which might increase drag by causing an early separation of the flow.
C. Orientation of optimum-forced structures
The orientation of the streamwise structures resulting from forcing was tested using phase-averaged streamwise vorticity contours in the cross-flow (yz) plane at the near-wake location of x/d = 2 (Fig. 6). The vortex-shedding signal served as a reference for phase-averaging and was acquired from an X-wire (placed close to the measurement plane) simultaneously with the pulse-output signal from the timing-box, which was used to trigger the laser and the camera. The X-wire signal was bandpass filtered in post-processing at the most prominent frequency of the wake to get a sinusoid representing vortex shedding. Afterwards, each cycle of the sinusoid was divided into 30 bins and the images were allocated among them depending on the occurrence of each laser-pulse during one period.
The streamwise vorticity contours in Fig. 6 were obtained in the wake of a λ/d = 4 actuator during forcing with BR = 0.6. Figures 6(a) and 6(b) both show distinct patterns of streamwise vorticity in the shear layers of the cylinder near-wake. A distinct streamwise vortex forms at each juncture between a plasma region and no-plasma region. The sense of the streamwise vorticity induces flow toward the wake centerline in the plasma regions and outward-directed flow in the no-plasma regions. This sense of vorticity at BR = 0.6 is opposite of the vorticity produced with blowing at BR = 0.2 [17]. Also, Fig. 6 reveals that the sense of rotation of the streamwise vortices is constant throughout the cycle, unlike the characteristic of naturally forming mode-A structures which change their sense of rotation with each half-shedding cycle. Therefore, it is evident that forcing with the mode-A wavelength does not necessarily generate structures associated with the same mode.
D. Changes in time-averaged streamwise vorticity with changes in blowing ratio
Forcing with BR = 0.2 did not significantly attenuate vortex shedding or reduce drag. Despite this, the signatures of streamwise vorticity for BR = 0.2 still appeared in the near-wake, as shown in Fig. 7. In the λ/d = 1 case, no clear spatial pattern of streamwise vortices is observed in the time-averaged contours of vorticity, for either blowing ratio. In contrast, from λ/d = 2 onwards, the pattern of streamwise vorticity is spatially locked in a time-averaged manner and we observed no temporal variation in the spatial structure of streamwise vorticity. On the top half of the cross-flow plane (looking toward the flow), an anticlockwise circulation (blue contours) developed at the left corner of each buried electrode, followed by a clockwise circulation (red contours) at the right corner. The sense of circulations on the bottom half of the wake was exactly the opposite. When the blowing ratio was increased from BR = 0.2 to BR = 0.6, the actuators with wavelength λ/d = 1, 2, and 3 retained this orientation, but for λ/d ≥ 4, the orientation flipped, indicating a fundamental change in the wake dynamics for these higher wavelengths. This observation coincides with a similar trend in the magnitude of the peaks of the power spectra in Fig. 2: the plasma regions have higher power peaks for λ/d = 1, 2, and 3, but the no-plasma regions have higher power peaks for λ/d = 4, 5, and 6.
To elucidate why the transition from forcing with BR = 0.2 to BR = 0.6 changed the sense of rotation of the streamwise vortices for λ/d ≥ 4, we performed PIV measurements in the horizontal xz plane close to the cylinder at y/d = 0.5. The streamline traces in Fig. 8 show that the regions with circulating flows formed at the edge of each buried electrode for λ/d ≥ 4. These counter-rotating vortices entrained fluid from the no-plasma region into the plasma region. As a result, a remarkable amount of backflow occurred in the no-plasma regions and the local downstream momentum flux in the plasma regions increased. A saddle point marks the boundary of the backflow region. A similar experiment, carried out during forcing with BR = 0.2, did not produce these circulating regions. The counter-rotating structures were clearly the cross sections of longitudinal vortices that developed very close to the cylinder while forcing with BR = 0.6. These vortices diverted a significant amount of flow from the near-wake toward the cylinder. Therefore, the supply of fluid to the Kármán vortex was reduced leading to its attenuation. The vortices also induced a considerable strain field in the wake. The existence of a distinct saddle point downstream of the no-plasma region clearly indicates the presence of a strong strain field in the near-wake during forcing with BR = 0.6.
E. Spanwise wake structure at BR = 0.6
To understand the impact of λ/d = 4 forcing with BR = 0.6 on the wake structure, PIV measurements were also made in xy planes in the plasma and no-plasma regions. The streamline traces in Fig. 9 show the differential nature of the near wake caused by this forcing. The wake became much wider in the no-plasma region compared to the plasma region as evident from the larger size of time-averaged recirculation bubble in the former. In the plasma region, the wake width has decreased and the recirculating region has moved further downstream with a longer formation length. Figure 9 also corroborates the velocity profiles of Fig. 4, which clearly showed similar differential behavior.
F. Discussion
The velocity spectra and drag measurements both pointed to an optimum forcing condition when the forcing wavelength in the BR = 0.6 case was λ/d = 4. We note that this wavelength is similar to πd, the wavelength used by Kim and Choi [9] at Re = 3900. Also, our results experimentally confirm the effectiveness of λ/d = 4 over that of λ/d = 2, in contrast to the work of Poncet et_al [10], who used both wavelengths for drag reduction. Forcing with λ/d = 4, however, did not generate structures resembling mode-A since streamwise vorticity associated with mode A will change the sense of rotation after every half cycle, but the sense of the streamwise vorticity measured here was constant.
The relative merit of the different spanwise wavelengths is most readily seen in Fig. 8. The downstream extent of regions of recirculating flow is clearly a maximum for the λ/d = 4 actuator. This is likely a function of the spanwise spacing between adjacent longitudinal vortices that are produced by the actuation. The λ/d = 4 actuator created the largest recirculation regions because it permitted the optimal development of streamwise vorticity in the wake. Shorter spanwise wavelengths inhibit the formation of sufficient streamwise vorticity due to the competition between adjacent regions of streamwise vorticity. Longer spanwise wavelengths result in reduced spanwise impact of the streamwise vorticity and regions of induced velocity. Thus, there is a trade-off between these two effects, which results in an optimum condition where the streamwise vortices are formed with optimal size and strength under mutual induction from adjacent vortices. The size and strength of the backflow regions observed in Fig. 8 are directly related to the degree of this mutual interaction.
The formation length of the spanwise rollers is directly related to the base pressure and thus drag [20]. Figures 8 and 9 clearly show the longer formation length of the wake under λ/d = 4 actuation. This allows the base pressure to increase relative to the baseline case due to increased distance between the spanwise rollers and the cylinder. The higher base pressure then results in reduced pressure drag acting on the cylinder.
To explain the difference in the pattern of time-averaged streamwise vorticity between the BR = 0.2 and BR = 0.6 cases in Fig. 7, we refer to the work of Jukes and Choi [18], who used a two-dimensional DBD actuator with a blowing ratio of 0.3 (U_{∞} = 4.6 m/s, U_{j} = 1.6 m/s). They observed that the induced jet from the plasma actuators caused local separation by forming a bubble, which forced the incoming boundary layer to lift up. A similar phenomenon with segmented forcing will cause a kink in the spanwise vortex and result in the observed streamwise vorticity patterns in the BR = 0.2 case. A detailed explanation of this behavior is provided in the work of Bhattacharya and Gregory [17]. In the BR = 0.6 case, however, strong recirculating zones created longitudinal vortices that were tilted under the action of the incoming flow. A similar mechanism was proposed by Hwang, Kim, and Choi [19] while discussing the stability characteristics of optimum wavelength forcing. We argue that a switch in the action of the induced jet by the plasma actuators—from causing a blockage to incoming flow to creating recirculating zones at the corners of the buried electrode—will result in the flow field, as observed in Fig. 7.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
To explore the optimum wavelength of three-dimensional forcing on the wake of a circular cylinder at Re = 4700, segmented DBD plasma actuators were mounted on the surface of a cylinder in a square-wave pattern such that plasma-induced velocities were generated only at selected spanwise locations, dictated by the actuation wavelength. Actuators with six wavelengths, from λ/d = 1 to λ/d = 6, were tested with two blowing ratios, denoted as BR = 0.2 and BR = 0.6. The objective of this study was to determine the optimum wavelength for distributed forcing with tangential blowing and evaluate whether forcing with a specific mode created structures pertaining to that same mode. Spectral studies and drag measurements with X-wire sensors revealed that at the higher blowing ratio, BR = 0.6, λ/d = 4 was the optimum wavelength for forcing, as maximum drag reduction was achieved by this actuator. The phase-averaged streamwise vorticity plots, however, revealed that the secondary structures did not change their sense of rotation after each half-shedding cycle. Hence, forcing with the λ/d = 4 actuator does not necessarily create mode-A structures rather the topology of the structures depends on the forcing configuration. Finally, the effectiveness of forcing with an optimum wavelength is attributed to the strong recirculating regions at the corners of each buried electrode, which created longitudinal vortices in the near-wake, leading to the attenuation of vortex shedding.
