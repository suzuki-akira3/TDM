Quasi-adiabatic calorimeter for direct electrocaloric measurements
The electrocaloric effect (ECE) in ferroelectric materials is a promising candidate for small, effective, low cost, and environmentally friendly solid state cooling applications. Instead of the commonly used indirect estimates based on Maxwell’s relations, direct measurements of the ECE are required to obtain reliable values. In this work, we report on a custom-made quasi-adiabatic calorimeter for direct ECE measurements. The ECE is measured for two promising lead-free materials: Ba(Zr_{0.12}Ti_{0.88})O_{3} and Ba(Zr_{0.2}Ti_{0.8})O_{3} bulk ceramics. Adiabatic temperature changes of ΔT_{EC} = 0.5 K at 355 K and ΔT_{EC} = 0.3 K at 314 K were achieved under the application of an electric field of 2 kV/mm for the Ba(Zr_{0.12}Ti_{0.88})O_{3} and Ba(Zr_{0.2}Ti_{0.8})O_{3} samples, respectively. The quasi-adiabatic ECE measurements reliably match other direct EC measurements using a differential scanning calorimeter or an infrared camera. The data are compared to indirect EC estimations based on Maxwell’s relations and show that the indirect measurements typically underestimate the effect to a certain degree.
I. INTRODUCTION
The electrocaloric effect (ECE) is a phenomenon in ferroelectric materials, which occurs when the application of an electric field leads to a change in dipole state entailing a change of temperature or entropy under adiabatic or isothermal conditions, respectively. In order to achieve a large ECE value, the proximity of a ferroelectric phase transition is essential since corresponding polarization changes are accompanied by large entropy changes [1–4].
The ECE has come into focus of interest after Mischenko et_al reported on a large ECE value in PbZr_{0.95}Ti_{0.05}O_{3} ferroelectric thin films [5]. It has then been investigated in ferroelectric thick films [6,7], thin films [5,8,9], polymers [10,11], single crystals [12–14], and bulk ceramics [15–18]. Most studies calculate the electrocaloric temperature change from the temperature dependence of polarization at different electric fields, P(E, T), using Maxwell’s relation: ∂S∂E{T,σ}=∂P∂T{E,σ}. However, for ferroelectric materials, the appropriateness of such an indirect estimate is disputable. Indirect EC measurements can be insufficient due to the following reasons [19]: (1) P(E) measurements are generally susceptible to artefacts [20], (2) P(E, T) should be single valued by reconciling with any electrical or thermal hysteresis (e.g., by collecting isofield data while varying temperature [21] or by collecting isothermal data after thermal excursions) [22], (3) any relaxor behavior of the system should be eliminated by applying sufficiently large electric fields. It has been argued that Maxwell’s relations can be reliably used only for single domain crystals [23]. For multidomain ferroelectric ceramics, or non-ergodic systems, like relaxors, it has been shown that indirect estimates do not match the results of direct EC measurements [4,24,25]. Thus, direct EC measurements are ultimately needed.
Direct EC measurements require an instrument that is not commercially available yet. There are only a few groups worldwide that have developed custom-made or modified commercial setups for direct ECE measurements. Designs comprise (1) using an infrared sensor or a thermal microscope [19,26,27], (2) using a thermometer in direct contact with the sample [28–30], (3) modifying a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) [23,31,32], (4) using a thermocaloric bomb at quasi-adiabatic conditions [14,32], or (5) using a high frequency method to measure the ECE in thin films. The latter is very challenging due to the low thermal mass of the films [33]. According to the definition of the ECE, the most direct approach is to measure variation of the sample temperature under an electric field applied (removed) at adiabatic or quasi-adiabatic conditions.
The entropy of a polar material can be expressed as the sum of two components
where ΔS_{dip}E,T is the field- and temperature-dependent dipolar contribution and ΔS_{latt}(T) is the entropy part due to lattice vibrations [34]. Since the total change of entropy ΔS under adiabatic conditions must be zero, Eq. (1) implies
If an electric field is applied to a ferroelectric system, the dipoles are oriented in the field direction and the dipolar part of entropy usually decreases, ΔS_{dip}E,T<0. In order to ensure Eq. (2), the lattice part of entropy must increase when applying an electric field, ΔS_{latt}T>0, which gives rise to increasing temperature. By removing the electric field, the dipoles are disordered due to thermal fluctuations. Correspondingly, the dipolar contribution to entropy increases, thus S_{latt} must decrease under quasi-adiabatic condition, which leads to a temperature decrease of the system.
In this article, we describe the construction of a quasi-adiabatic calorimeter for direct ECE measurements. The performance of the calorimeter is demonstrated by ECE measurements of two bulk ceramics: ferroelectric Ba(Zr_{0.12}Ti_{0.88})O_{3} (BZT-12) and relaxor Ba(Zr_{0.2}Ti_{0.8})O_{3} (BZT-20). The results are compared with direct measurements taken by a modified DSC and an infrared camera. We also performed indirect estimations based on Maxwell’s relation. The EC measurements with a DSC and with the indirect measuring technique of the same material system were reported elsewhere [31].
II. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE
Figure 1 shows the scheme (a) and images (b) of the custom-made quasi-adiabatic setup for EC measurements. It consists of three chambers: an outer vacuum bell chamber, a middle chamber used for regulation of the set temperature of the system, and an inner chamber, where the sample is placed. The middle and inner chambers are built from gold-coated copper. The gold layer prevents oxidation of copper minimizing the losses due to heat radiation. These two chambers are completely independent from each other so that the pressure in each chamber is adjustable and controllable through an electrically driven valve system. Figure 2 shows the schematic diagram of the valve system, where the three chambers can be addressed separately via valves V2, V3, and V6.
To control the operating temperature, heating (Thermocoax SAS, France) and cooling lines are embedded in the middle chamber. The temperature is measured using a PT-100 sensor, power of the heating line is controlled by a temperature controller (Lake Shore 336, USA). The setup allows us to change the operating temperature between 260 K and 440 K. Helium is used to exchange heat between the middle and inner chambers. It ensures a homogenous heat flow (see Fig. 1). The inner chamber remains evacuated at all times during measurements (V4 closed). The sample base temperature is set via thermal radiation from the inner chamber walls under low vacuum (the turbo pump is switched off for temperature regulation). The inner chamber is filled with helium (V4 open) only for spanning larger temperature intervals faster.
Figure 3 represents a flow diagram of the EC measurement procedure. As starting condition, all valves are closed and a turbo pump (Pfeiffer HiPace 80, Germany) is switched off. In the second step (“Evacuation”), the chambers are evacuated. For adjusting the desired temperature (“Set-point”) in the “Regulation” step, the middle chamber is filled with helium. When the temperature set-point is reached (“1st Relaxation”), helium gas is evacuated from the middle chamber reaching high vacuum in all chambers (about 1 × 10^{−6} mbar) using the turbo pump. This ensures a quasi-stable temperature for the quasi-adiabatic conditions (“2nd Relaxation”). In order to perform the EC measurements, a high voltage is applied to the bottom electrode of the sample with a thin varnished copper wire. The grounded wire is connected to the top electrode. The Kapton^{®} insulated thermocouple of type K is fixed directly to the top electrode of the sample with alumina compound glue to prevent electrical contact to the highly sensitive temperature controller. No sample holder is used in order to minimize heat losses.
We use the following protocol for the EC measurements: Each temperature point is reached at about 0.1 K/min heating/cooling rate. Thereafter, the chambers are evacuated and the sample is kept under vacuum conditions for about 20 min to stabilize the temperature. Then a nearly rectangular dc voltage pulse with a field rate of 50 kV/s is applied for 100 s and removed for 100 s. The pulse is generated by a Keithley 3390 signal generator and amplified by a Trek PD05034 high voltage amplifier. The temperature of the sample is recorded as a function of time using the Lake Shore temperature controller. To run all procedures, a LabVIEW based software was developed so that EC measurements can be operated either fully automatically or manually with desired temperature steps. The setup allows EC measurements of samples with different masses and dimensions (e.g., bulk ceramics, thick films, multilayer capacitors) in a broad temperature range (260 K–440 K). Figure 4 illustrates the quasi-adiabatic calorimeter setup with required instruments to apply electric fields to the sample and to measure the temperature change.
Results from the quasi-adiabatic calorimeter are compared with other direct EC measurements performed using infrared detection and a modified DSC. The utilized infrared imaging uses an infrared (IR) camera FLIR XSC6580 with the temperature resolution of 20 mK. The working frequency of the camera is 15.7 Hz. Electric field is applied at a constant current of 1 mA with a Keithley 2410 sourcemeter via two 220 μm thick copper wires. The sample temperature is set by a Linkam temperature controller stage THMS600. The upper sample face is spray-painted in black (emissivity around 0.96) to achieve a high and homogeneous surface emissivity. The camera emissivity has been calibrated with a black body (emissivity 1) provided by the manufacturer for temperatures from 4 °C to 125 °C. The calibration yields a correspondence between the given temperature and the corresponding signal obtained from each pixel of the camera sensor. In our case, emissivity was <1. Therefore, we used the ASTM international procedure to compensate for reflected temperature [35]. Assuming that our sample is an opaque grey body, we were able to determine the emissivity of the sample surface for each pixel by measuring the actual sample temperature using a thermocouple. All measurements with the IR camera were performed in an open chamber. The reported temperatures are averaged over the entire sample area corresponding to the infrared temperature measured with the camera. The temperature change is extracted by averaging over five measurements. No significant difference has been observed between EC heating and cooling. The experimental procedures using a modified DSC and indirect measurement methods have been reported elsewhere [31].
The ceramic samples were synthesized via the mixed oxide route. Raw materials, BaCO_{3} (Solvay), ZrO_{2} (Saint-Gobain) and TiO_{2} (Tronox) were mixed in stoichiometric ratio and milled in deionized water using a planetary ball mill (Fritsch, Pulverisette 5) at 200 rpm for 6 h. The powder was dried, sieved, and calcined in alumina crucibles at 1200 °C for 2 h. The calcined powder was subsequently pressed into 10 mm diameter disk samples and sintered at 1325 °C for 4 h. Before performing the measurements, the diameter of the samples was reduced to 4 mm with a diamond core drilling machine. Afterwards, the samples were ground to a thickness of around 0.5 mm and sputtered with 100 nm thick Au electrodes on both faces. Mean dielectric strength of E_{d} ≈ 10 kV/mm and E_{d} ≈ 12 kV/mm was obtained for BZT-12 and BZT-20 ceramics, respectively.
III. CORRECTION FACTOR FOR THE QUASI-ADIABATIC SETUP
The heat generated by the ECE inside the active element, namely, the ferroelectric sample, is redistributed over other components of the system: electrodes, wires, etc. In order to estimate the true EC temperature change, ΔT_{EC}, the measured value, ΔT_{measured}, must be corrected taking into account the geometry of the system and the total heat capacities of all components.
The C_{p}^{i} are the heat capacities of each subsystem in contact with the sample [i.e., enameled copper wire (c_{p} = 385 J/kg K) fixed with silver paste (c_{p} = 235 J/kg K), thermocouple fixed with alumina compound (c_{p} = 900 J/kg K)]. C_{p}^{EC} is the heat capacity of the sample covered by the electrode [29]. In bulk materials, depending on the thickness of the sample, the sum of heat capacities of the materials in contact with the studied sample was 5%-8% of the C_{p}^{EC}. The temperature dependence of the heat capacity of the samples was measured at zero electric field using a DSC setup [31].
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
A typical time-dependent EC measurement performed with our quasi-adiabatic calorimeter is shown in Fig. 5 for the BZT-20 ceramic. When applying an electric field, the temperature of the sample increases keeping the total entropy constant (ΔS ≈ 0) [see Eq. (2)]. Vice versa, the temperature of the system decreases when the electric field is switched off. Both positive and negative temperature changes are of similar magnitude, which shows the reversibility of the ECE. Leakage currents through the sample are very small (<10^{−8} A), hence the contribution by Joule heating is not relevant in this case. The magnitude of the EC temperature change increases with increasing electric field value. The electric fields were applied and removed twice for each value to confirm the reproducibility of the ECE and to evaluate the mean of the EC temperature change.
Due to non-ideal adiabatic conditions and the finite thermal mass of the samples, a relaxation of the sample temperature towards the bath temperature is observed. Figure 6 presents the results of the EC relaxation time measurements conducted for the BZT-12 sample with an applied electric field of ΔE = 1.5 kV/mm at three different temperatures, namely, T = 279 K, 300 K, and 370 K. The relaxation back to the bath temperature for both applying and removing the electric field takes about 100-1000 s for all three temperatures. The calorimeter is thus not fully adiabatic due to the unavoidable losses through heat radiation, but it verifies the quasi-adiabatic condition of the setup operating in high-vacuum. In comparison, for non-adiabatic EC setups (e.g., a modified DSC or direct temperature reading in atmosphere), the relaxation time was reported to be about 5-10 s, i.e., about 100 times faster [4,29,34,36]. The relaxation curves can be approximated with an exponential function
where τ is the relaxation time constant. The shortest time constant, τ = 212 s, is obtained in the vicinity of the phase transition, at T = 370 K, where BZT-12 exhibits the largest ECE. Thermal relaxation occurs very quickly after a large EC temperature change. The relaxation time constant is larger at 300 K and 279 K with τ = 300 s and 388 s, respectively, where the EC temperature changes are significantly smaller. The main mechanism of thermal equilibration in our case is heat emission and absorption via thermal radiation. In a first approximation, we consider both our sample and the inner chamber wall as black bodies. Then, according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the total heat flux, ϕ_{q}t,T, from the sample will be proportional to ϕ_{q}∼Tbath+ΔTt{4}−Tbath4≈4ΔT⋅Tbath3ΔT≪T_{bath}, where ΔT(t) is the actual difference between the sample and the bath temperatures. Since the time derivative of the sample temperature is proportional to the heat flux from the sample, we can write
where C is the sample heat capacitance. According to Eq. (4), dTdt=−ΔTτ and we obtain for the relaxation time constant
The inset in Fig. 6 shows the best fit of the relaxation time by a power law τ = a·T^{n}. The obtained value of the power exponent is n = −2.2 ± 0.5. Despite the limited number of experimental points, the analysis roughly confirms that thermal radiation is the main source of the thermal equilibration in our setup.
Figures 7(a) and 8(a) show the EC temperature changes ΔT_{EC} measured for BZT-12 and BZT-20 ceramics as a function of temperature at different electric fields (E = 1 kV/mm, 1.5 kV/mm, and 2 kV/mm). All curves exhibit a maximum at approximately 355 K for BZT-12 and at 315 K for BZT-20. This maximum lies a few degrees above the corresponding ferroelectric to paraelectric phase transition temperature determined from dielectric measurements [31]. The ECE for BZT-20 features a broad peak due to the diffuse phase transition which is typical for this material [37]. Maximal temperature changes of ΔT_{EC} = 0.5 K and ΔT_{EC} = 0.3 K were achieved for an applied electric field of ΔE = 2 kV/mm for BZT-12 and BZT-20, respectively.
Figure 7(b) compares the results of the direct quasi-adiabatic EC measurements for the BZT-12 sample with the direct DSC, IR measurements, and the indirect estimate. The results of all direct EC measurements are in very good agreement. For the DSC measurements, the EC temperature change was calculated using a zero-field value of the specific heat capacity [31]. The good coincidence of the EC curve measured by DSC with the data obtained from other direct setups indicates that the specific heat capacity is not influenced by the moderate electric field of ΔE = 1 kV/mm. The indirect approach leads to an underestimation of the ECE, especially in the vicinity of the ferroelectric phase transition. We believe that this is mainly due to the different experimental conditions applied for the indirect measurements. The temperature dependences of polarization at different electric fields used for the indirect estimations are obtained from the polarization hysteresis loops measured at AC electric fields of 50 kHz (positive upper branch of the loops is analyzed). The direct EC measurements are performed under DC electric field pulses. Since the polarization switching strongly depends on the pulse duration or AC field frequency [38], a lower degree of polarization saturation is expected for the indirect measurements. The difference is more pronounced in the ferroelectric phase at lower temperatures. We suggest that the small shift of the ECE peak position estimated by the indirect approach results from experimental errors in the temperature determination considering that both direct and indirect EC-measurements were performed with different setups. We cannot exclude a real very small finite difference between both methods though, but this is beyond the absolute temperature resolution of either setup.
Figure 8(b) compares the results of the direct EC measurements for BZT-20 using the quasi-adiabatic calorimeter, the modified DSC setup, and the IR camera together with the indirect method. Similar to the case of BZT-12, the indirect approach yields smaller ECE values than the direct measurements, especially in the vicinity of the ferroelectric phase transition. BZT-20 exhibits a diffuse phase transition behavior featured by a broad peak of the dielectric permittivity [31]. Such behavior is attributed to the relaxor-like character of BZT-20, where local polar nanosized regions (PNRs) persist beyond the macroscopic phase transition temperature. For an applied electric field, the PNRs align along the field direction giving an additional extrinsic contribution to the entropy change and correspondingly to ΔT_{EC}, which is not considered by Maxwell’s relations. This is one reason why the indirect evaluation yields an underestimation of the EC effect. Contrary to the case of BZT-12, the EC values measured by the different direct methods are not consistent. In particular, the DSC measurements show a peak at about 307 K, which does not appear in the quasi-adiabatic and IR measurements. Around the maximum of the dielectric permittivity [31], the values measured by the IR camera are lower than those measured with the quasi-adiabatic calorimeter and the DSC-setup. We assume that this discrepancy comes from both variation of the measurement protocols and the relaxor character of BZT-20. The EC measurement with DSC began at T = 293 K, where the system is in the ferroelectric phase, while measurements with the quasi-adiabatic calorimeter and IR camera started closer to the maximum of the EC temperature change. It is well known that for materials with a diffuse phase transition, ferroelectric domains coexist with PNRs around the maximum of the dielectric permittivity [31,37,39]. We started the DSC measurement at a temperature substantially below T_{max}, where only ferroelectric domains exist. Therefore, the peak on the temperature dependence of the ECE at 308 K can be attributed to a decay of ferroelectric domains into PNRs. A similarly sharp peak together with a broad maximum was also reported for other relaxor systems [37]. The adiabatic and IR measurements started at higher temperature, probably already in a state where ferroelectric domains and PNRs are coexisting. Therefore, we did not observe such a sharp peak. All measurement methods including the indirect estimation are in good agreement above the maximum of the dielectric permittivity. This strongly suggests that EC measurements in relaxor systems yield different ECE values around the diffuse phase transition depending on the starting conditions of the experiment.
In summary, we report on a new quasi-adiabatic setup for direct measurements of the electrocaloric effect. The setup works in the temperature range between 260 K and 440 K. It is able to measure the EC temperature change with a sensitivity of 10 mK. The setup allows us to perform measurements on bulk materials, thick films, and multilayered structures. The operability of the setup was demonstrated on Ba(Zr_{0.12}Ti_{0.88})O_{3} and Ba(Zr_{0.2}Ti_{0.8})O_{3} ceramics as well as PMN-PT multilayers [40]. The obtained data were compared with results of direct EC measurements using modified DSC, IR camera, and the indirect method. The direct EC measurements provide generally very similar data. The indirect estimation leads to lower values of ΔT_{EC} than the direct EC measurements. This is related to the only partially saturated polarization of the ceramics by polarization hysteresis loop measurements using AC electric fields which results in the absence of thermodynamic equilibrium turning Maxwell’s relations invalid.
