On exceeding the solubility limit of Cr^{+3} dopants in SnO_{2} nanoparticles based dilute magnetic semiconductors
The paper investigates the magnetic behavior of chromium doped SnO_{2} Dilute Magnetic Semiconductor (DMS) nanoparticles, through structural, spectroscopic, and magnetic studies. A non-equilibrium solution combustion method is adopted to synthesize 0–5 at. % Cr doped SnO_{2} nanoparticles. The detailed spectroscopic studies on the system using micro-Raman spectroscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy along with the structural analysis confirm the presence of Cr in 3+ oxidation state, which substitutes at Sn^{4+} site in SnO_{6} octahedra of the rutile structure. This doping is found to enhance the defects in the system, i.e., oxygen vacancies. All the synthesized SnO_{2} nanoparticles (with or without dopants) are found to exhibit Room Temperature Ferromagnetism (RTFM). This occurrence of RTFM is attributed to the magnetic exchange interaction through F-centers of oxygen vacancies as well as dopant magnetic impurities and explained through the Bound Magnetic Polaron (BMP) model of DMS systems. Nonetheless, as the doping of Cr is further increased beyond 2%, the solubility limit is achieved. This antiferromagnetic exchange interaction from interstitial Cr dopants dominates over the BMP mechanism and, hence, leads to the decrease in the net magnetic moment drastically.
I. INTRODUCTION
Dilute Magnetic Semiconductors (DMS) are transition metal doped semiconducting materials that exhibit ferromagnetism [1–3]. This doping of transition metal or rare earth metal ion in non-magnetic materials (oxides or nitrides) results in the room temperature ferromagnetic ordering or leads to the intrinsic ferromagnetism [3–5]. These dilute dopants enhance the applicability of the material without altering the original properties of the system. In addition, this spin incorporation expands the utility of semiconductor metal oxides into wider area of spintronics. Although the magnetization achieved in these materials is not comparable to the classical ferromagnetic materials, it is sufficient for their use in spin coupled opto-electronic devices [6–8].
SnO_{2} is a versatile, wide bandgap n-type oxide semiconductor. It shows unconventional coexistence of high electrical conductivity along with optical transparency [9]. The DMS properties of SnO_{2} are still underexplored as compared to the other n-type metal oxides such as ZnO or TiO_{2} [2]. Several researchers have reported the existence of ferromagnetism in Mn doped or Co doped SnO_{2} [4,10–12]. Since most of Cr oxides are antiferromagnetic in nature (except CrO_{2}), Cr doped SnO_{2} is an ideal system to study the DMS properties in an otherwise non-magnetic metal oxide [13]. The ferromagnetism in these materials is highly dependent on the processing conditions and synthesis method adopted. From literature, the ferromagnetism is usually observed in materials with high defect concentration, resulting from the high temperature or non-equilibrium processes synthesis approaches [2,6].
In our previous study, the existence of Room Temperature Ferromagnetism (RTFM) in undoped SnO_{2} synthesized by solution combustion method is identified due to the presence of structural defects, which are generally oxygen vacancies in the rutile lattice. Here, in this paper, the effect of Cr doping is studied on the structural, magnetic, and optical properties of SnO_{2}.
II. EXPERIMENTAL
Sn_{1−x}Cr_{x}O_{2} (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.05) nanoparticles have been prepared using tin oxalate (Sigma Aldrich, USA), urea (S. D. Fine Chemicals, India), and chromium nitrate (Sigma Aldrich, USA) as starting materials. About 50 mg of tin oxalate (SnC_{2}O_{4}, from Sigma Aldrich, USA) was added to 25 ml of distilled water with continuous stirring. Drops of conc. HNO_{3} were added to this solution until a clear solution of tin nitrate is obtained as Eq. (1a). The amount of fuel was calculated for different percentage of chromium (x %), considering the ratio of oxidizer to fuel as unity. This calculation of the metal nitrates to fuel ratio has been described elsewhere [14–16]. The balanced chemical reaction is given in Eq. (1b). The stoichiometric mixture of nitrates and fuels was dissolved in water for obtaining an aqueous combustion mixture solution. This solution was kept in a muffle furnace preheated to 500 °C. The solution was found to boil initially, followed by froth, and later caught flame with the evolution of a large amount of gases. The flame persisted for about a minute, leaving behind a fine residual powder. The stoichiometry and chemical reaction involved in the combustion process can be written as
The as-synthesized samples of Cr doped SnO_{2} are coded as TOCr1, TOCr2, TOCr3, TOCr4, and TOCr5 for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 at. % Cr doping, respectively. The structure and crystallinity were studied using x-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) obtained on PANalytical X'pert Pro diffractometer at a scan rate of 2°/min at a step size of 0.013°, using Cu K_{α} radiation (1.5418 Ȧ). Further, the morphology and structural characterizations were investigated using High Resolution Transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) (Model Tecnai G-20 at 200 keV). The surface chemical compositions were studied by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum recorded on Thermo Fisher Scientific Multilab 2000 (England) instrument with Al K_{α} radiation (1486.6 eV). The binding energies reported here have been corrected using graphite as reference at 284.5 eV with an accuracy of ±0.5 eV. The room temperature Raman spectra were recorded on Horiba Jobin Yvon HR-Raman-microPL spectrometer with 325 and 519 nm excitation sources for PL and Raman studies, respectively. The magnetic hysteresis measurements were done using Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) and Physical Property Measurement system (PPMS) from Quantum design in the temperature range of 10–300 K. The room temperature Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker X-band spectrometer, and an equal weight of 10 mg was subjected to measurement for the comparison of the signal.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. X-ray diffraction
The XRD patterns of Sn_{1−x}Cr_{x}O_{2} (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.05; in steps of 0.01) are shown in Fig. 1(a). All the patterns exhibit the peak positions corresponding to the rutile type SnO_{2}, according to JCPDS card no 41-1445. There is no peak observed corresponding to any impurity phase or Cr_{2}O_{3} within the limits of resolution, which confirms the absence of any impurity phases in all the synthesized oxides. All the peak profiles are considerably broadened, thereby depicting the formation of nanosized crystallites in these materials.
In order to study the effect of doping on the lattice structure and related parameters, the XRD patterns were analyzed using Williamson-Hall (W-H) relation as shown in Eq. (2), and the corresponding W-H plots are shown in Fig. 1(b),
where 2θ is the Bragg diffraction angle, λ is the wavelength of x-ray source (Cu K_{α} 1.5418 A°), β is the full width at half maxima (FWHM) of the corresponding XRD peak, and ε is the effective strain in the lattice. The variation of “a” and “c” lattice parameters, effective strain (ε) in the lattice, and the crystallite size calculated using Eq. (2) with increasing Cr doping are summarized in Table I. Here, it is seen that both the lattice constants (i.e., “a” and “c”) decrease monotonously up to 2 at. % Cr doping. A further increase in Cr doping concentration leads to an abrupt change in “c” parameter, while lattice parameter “a” is found to decrease with Cr doping. The crystallite size is also seen to follow a similar trend, i.e., it initially increases with increasing Cr doping and drastically decreases beyond 2% Cr doping. However, the initial negative value of the slope of (β cos θ/λ) vs. (sin θ/λ) line (which indicates a compressive strain in the lattice) is gradually changed to a positive value (indicating a tensile strain) with increasing Cr doping. The systematic shift in XRD peak positions of SnO_{2} towards higher 2θ values indicates the change in lattice parameters with increasing Cr content, which may be due to the substitution of Sn^{+4} ions (ionic radius 69 pm) by smaller Cr^{+3} (ionic radius 61.5 pm) ions. This substitution may result in the contraction of lattice parameters, which is also reflected in increasing compressive strain in the lattice as seen in Table I. This sudden and drastic change in the lattice parameter and evolution of tensile strain beyond 2 at. % Cr doping could be an indication of Cr interstitials formation, as the solubility limit is exceeded on further increasing the total Cr content in the lattice.
B. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
The crystallite size, crystallinity, and morphology were further examined using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and Fig. 2 shows High Resolution TEM (HRTEM) micrographs along with Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED) pattern of TOCr2. Figure 2(a) depicts the morphology and uniform size distribution of TOCr2 nanoparticles, while Fig. 2(b) is a phase contrast image of Fig. 2(a), which reflects the homogeneity and the compositional uniformity of the oxide. From Fig. 2(c), the average crystallite size calculated is ∼8 nm [see Fig. 2(f)], which is in fair accordance with the value calculated by XRD. The corresponding selected area electron diffraction pattern is shown in Fig. 2(d) and is indexed as per lattice-spacing of (110), (101), and (211) reflections of rutile SnO_{2}. Further, the corresponding planar spacing is estimated from HRTEM micrographs [Fig. 2(e)] as 0.338, 0.262, and 0.184, respectively.
C. Raman spectroscopy
The Raman spectra of undoped as well as Cr doped SnO_{2} samples are shown in Fig. 3 along with the spectra of bulk SnO_{2} and Cr_{2}O_{3} powders for comparison. The SnO_{2} has a rutile structure and belongs to the P_{42}/mnm (D4h14) space group. Each unit cell contains two molecules, and according to group theory, the total vibrational modes of tin oxide tetragonal rutile system are given as shown in Eq. (3) [17,18],
Out of these, only four modes are Raman active, namely, A_{1g}, B_{1g}, B_{2g}, and doubly degenerate E_{g} [17,18]. Figure 3 shows the deconvoluted Raman spectra in the wave number range 350–800 cm^{−1}, which contains A_{1g}, B_{2g}, and E_{g} modes only (shown by dashed black lines). Here, it is interesting to note that all the peaks of all the samples are fairly broadened due to the smaller crystallite size of the synthesized nanoparticles. Further, the variation in the full width at half maxima (FWHM) of the peaks and the systematic shifts in peak positions are in accordance with the variation in crystallite size as expected [18,19].
To understand the effect of Cr doping, the spectra are compared with the bulk Cr_{2}O_{3} powders. In case of Cr doped SnO_{2} samples, the two additional peaks are observed (shown by red dotted lines); however, the most intense peak seen in the Raman spectra of bulk Cr_{2}O_{3} is found to be absent. In case of Cr^{+3} substitutions at Sn^{+4} site, Cr^{+3} has an octahedral coordination with 6 oxide ions, which is the same as that of Cr_{2}O_{3} system. Hence, this behavior could be understood by studying the nature of Cr - O interaction in CrO_{6} octahedra in a corundum structure of Cr_{2}O_{3}. The rhombohedral Cr_{2}O_{3} crystallizes in R3¯c (D3d6) space group, and the corresponding irreducible representation of vibrational modes according to group theory can be written as [20,21]
In this case, only seven modes (two A_{1g} and five E_{g}) are Raman active [20,21]. The range of spectra under study (shown in Fig. 3) contains only one A_{1g} (at ∼550 cm^{−1}) and two prominent E_{g} modes. However, in Cr doped SnO_{2} samples, only two E_{g} modes are distinctly identified and A_{1g} mode is found to be absent. Here, it is important to note that the characteristic A_{1g} mode originates from the symmetric vibrations of CrO_{6} octahedra [22]. In case of Cr^{+3} substitutions at Sn^{+4} site, the charge neutrality of the entire crystal demands the formation of an oxygen vacancy per Cr^{+3} dopant ion [23]. Therefore, the smaller cross section of A_{1g} mode in the Raman spectra could be attributed to the absence of complete CrO_{6} octahedra. However, the presence of any impurity phase of Cr_{2}O_{3} is ruled out by XRD as the XRD peaks are indicative of long range periodic ordering of the atoms, while Raman spectra are specific to local chemical bonding.
D. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
The surface stoichiometry and chemical states of elements present in undoped and Cr doped SnO_{2} are further examined by XPS and are shown in Fig. 4. Figure 4(a) shows the comparison of full binding energy range scan (survey spectra) of TO and TOCr2 samples. No other elements were found other than Sn, O, and Cr as marked for various lines of these elements. The Ag and C arise from the silver epoxy used for grounding the surface charge. Figure 4(b) depicts XPS spectrum of Cr 2p region of TOCr2. The Cr 2p_{3/2} peak is centered at 577.2 eV, and no other peaks could be found in this region. The shoulder at ∼572 eV is attributed to Ag 3p_{3/2}, which originates from silver paste used for making conducting contact in the chamber [as mentioned earlier and is also confirmed by Ag 3d lines seen in survey spectrum at ∼380 eV shown in Fig. 4(a)]. This indicates that Cr exists in +3 oxidation state only. Further, in Fig. 4(c), no shoulder peak was observed corresponding to Sn3d peak in either case (i.e., doped as well as undoped SnO_{2}). This confirms that Sn is in only Sn^{+4} state, and no Sn^{+2} state can be found within the resolution limit. It may be seen in Fig. 4(d) that O 1s XPS spectra of undoped and Cr doped SnO_{2} exhibit nearly same profile. The higher binding energy (HBE) peak in the O 1s line is a measure of oxygen non-stoichiometry in the oxide. From Fig. 4(d), it is clearly seen that the relative contribution of HBE peak increases with Cr doping. This signifies an increased concentration of oxygen vacancies on Cr doping. Since Cr^{+3} substitutes at Sn^{+4} sites, the oxygen vacancies are formed to maintain charge neutrality of the crystal. This justifies the observed enhanced relative percentage of HBE peak. Besides, the HBE peak in TOCr2 is shifted towards higher binding energy. As the binding energies of the elements are very sensitive to their local chemical environment, this shift in HBE peak could be ascribed to photoelectrons suffering additional energy loss interaction with Cr^{3+}dopant ions in the solid.
E. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)
The EPR spectra of Cr doped SnO_{2} samples are shown in Fig. 5(a), along with undoped SnO_{2} and the cavity signal (i.e., in the absence of sample and reference material). Here, 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picryl hydrazyl (DPPH) was used as a standard reference material. The sharp signal due to DPPH [marked as (i) in Fig. 5(a)] is used as a reference for calculating g-values of the sample signals. The spectra of the samples consist of three major signals, which are ascribed to Cr doping, due to their absence in EPR spectra of undoped SnO_{2} (TO). As reported earlier by Misra et_al [24], the three signals result from Cr^{3+} ions present at crystallographically different positions such as (ii) Cr^{3+} substitution at an octahedral site, (iii) the broad Ferromagnetic Resonance (FMR) signal due to ferromagnetically coupled Cr^{3+} ions, and (iv) Cr^{3+} occupying the tetragonal site. From Fig. 5(a), it is evident that, as the dopant concentration increases beyond 2 at. % Cr doping, the relative contribution of the FMR (iii) signal and the signal due to Cr occupying tetrahedral site (iv) increases in intensity. Nonetheless, as stated by Misra et_al [24] the broad signal characterized by large Zero Field Splitting (ZFS) at g value ∼2 arises due to the interaction among the Cr^{3+} ion clusters resulting from excessive doping. This signifies the structural changes taking place upon excessive doping and leads to the drastic change in the type of magnetic interactions due to transition metal ion doping. Further, the signal marked by (v) in the EPR spectrum of undoped SnO_{2} is attributed predominantly to the surface oxygen defect [19], which is masked by the dominant signal (iii) in all the Cr doped samples.
F. Magnetic measurements
In order to study the magnetic behaviour of the undoped and doped oxides, the magnetization (M) as a function of magnetic field (H) was measured at room temperature (i.e., 300 K) as well as at low temperature (i.e., 10 K).
The magnetic hysteresis loops of undoped and Cr doped SnO_{2} samples are shown in Fig. 6(b) after subtracting the diamagnetic slope from the sample holder and teflon tape from total magnetization. As seen from Fig. 6(b), all the curves exhibit hysteresis, indicating ferromagnetic exchange coupling at room temperature (300 K). All the samples showed clear ferromagnetic behaviour; however, saturation magnetization is found to increase till 2% Cr doping. Further increase in Cr dopant concentration is found to reduce the saturation magnetization. Hence, the dopant concentration corresponding to maximum saturation magnetization [shown as inset in Fig. 6(b)] marks the limiting concentration as no other oxidation state of chromium could be seen in XPS and Raman studies. There are no peaks of other Cr oxides found in XRD. The low temperature measurements shown in Fig. 6(b) reveal that at low temperatures, the system exhibits a mixture of ferromagnetism and paramagnetic behaviour. Although this mixed behaviour is also observed in case of undoped SnO_{2} [19], the increasing slope of the M-H curve reflects the increasing paramagnetic contribution.
The temperature dependence of magnetization of Cr doped oxides is studied, and inverse of Direct Current (DC) susceptibility is plotted as a function of temperature in Fig. 7. The two regions of temperatures are clearly identified in the plot. The red continuous lines are fit to low temperature data, while green dotted lines are fit to high temperature region
The expression for Curie-Weiss law is shown in Eq. (5) [25], where χ is the susceptibility of solid, C is the curie constant, T is the absolute temperature, and T_{c} is the curie temperature. The value of curie temperature is zero for paramagnetic materials, positive for ferromagnetic materials, and negative for antiferromagnetic materials. Hence, the DC susceptibility of the doped compositions is measured, and inverse of susceptibility is plotted against absolute temperature. As can be seen from Fig. 7, all the compositions follow curie fit with zero intercept only in the low temperature region, marking a dominant paramagnetic behavior. However, the sign of intercept changes gradually across the dopant concentration from high positive for 1% Cr, slightly positive for 2% Cr, and a negative temperature for 3% Cr, thereby marking a transition from ferro to anti-ferro transition with an increase in the Cr dopant content. However, this transition temperature does not reflect the usual ferromagnetic to paramagnetic transitions in classical ferromagnets. The result may be interpreted as a consequence of the temperature at which the paramagnetic contribution from spurious origins subsides and the ferromagnetic order dominates.
The origin of ferromagnetic ordering in transition metal doped semiconductors has been a topic of debate worldwide due to the diverse nature of outcome of studies conducted by various researchers. Various synthesis methodologies lead to different physico-chemical attributes of the system, and hence, there is variation observed in magnetic behaviour of same chemical systems synthesized by different methods or different physical morphologies. Hence, it would be unjustified to compare the magnetic properties of same systems formed as a result of different processing conditions. In the present case, our method of synthesis is solution combustion method, which is a non-equilibrium one, i.e., characterized by high temperature treatment and followed by sudden self-quenching to room temperature. Hence, the high temperature achieved during combustion flame provides the high energies of formation of various defects in the system, i.e., vacancies and interstitials, which are still retained as a result of self-quenching [16,19,26]. As seen from various experimental characterizations, particularly the structural studies carried out using XRD and Raman spectroscopy reveal that preferably under these processing conditions Cr prefers to substitute at the six co-ordinated Sn site in the rutile type of structure, and this situation leads to the formation of oxygen site defect [charged vacancy as shown by Kröger-Vink notation] [23]
Nonetheless, the XPS confirms that the Cr ion present at the octahedral co-ordination is trivalent in nature. This trivalent chromium can have either low spin or high spin. However, the spin-density functional calculations performed by Borges et_al [27] show that the SnO_{2} system with Cr dopant in low spin state cannot induce a magnetic moment. On the other hand, if Cr is in high state, it can induce a weak magnetization into the system. This situation can be explained by the F-centre mediated exchange mechanism in dilute magnetic semiconducting oxides using a Bound Magnetic Polaron (BMP) model [28,29]. Here, the oxygen vacancy being positively charged traps the electron and is referred as an F-center. As stated earlier, majority of the oxygen vacancies in this system are adjacent to the Cr dopants in the lattice, leading to an F-centre exchange. The trend in magnetization in Cr doped SnO_{2} shown in the inset of Fig. 6(a) could be explained in terms of the dopant distribution (i.e., magnetic impurities) in the lattice, as well as the oxygen vacancies density. The relatively high magnetization values (up to 2% Cr) in this study are due to the origin in high oxygen vacancy density. As seen from EPR studies and the structural characterizations up to 2% Cr doping, the regular substitution at Sn site by promoting more oxygen vacancy formation leads to an enhancement in the magnetic exchange interaction. This interaction between the magnetic impurities is meditated through the F-centres as predicted by the BMP model. However, further increase in the Cr dopant concentration leads to the reduction in the Cr-Cr distance and even promotes their occupancy at the interstitial sites. As seen from signal (iv) of EPR spectra shown in Fig. 5, this increased vicinity of Cr ions leads to destruction in the F-center exchange interaction with a dominant antiferromagnetic interaction (seen in Fig. 7), similar to that of the chain of CrO_{6} octahedra in the Cr_{2}O_{3}. Thus, along with Cr dopant density, the F-centers, i.e., the oxygen vacancies, play a crucial role in invoking a ferromagnetic exchange interaction through carrier mediated polaron interaction.
IV. CONCLUSION
The dilute magnetic semiconducting properties of SnO_{2} nanoparticles are studied as a function of Cr doping. It is found that Cr^{3+}ions substitute at Sn^{4+} ion in aSnO_{6} octahedra up to 2 at. % Cr doping, beyond which the solubility limit is attained and the Cr dopant occupies the interstitial sites. Although all the undoped as well as Cr doped samples exhibit ferromagnetic hysteresis at 300 K, the saturation magnetization is found to reduce drastically beyond 2% of Cr doping. Further, the presence of charged oxygen vacancies adjacent to Cr^{3+} dopant ions substituted at Sn^{4+} sites acts as F-centres and traps the conduction electrons, which later induce a vacancy mediated ferromagnetic interaction in the rutile SnO_{2} system. However, upon exceeding the Cr dopant solubility limit (2%), the reduction in the interdistance of Cr-Cr pair induces an antiferromagnetic exchange, which may dominate over the F-center mediated ferromagnetism and reduces the saturation magnetization drastically.
