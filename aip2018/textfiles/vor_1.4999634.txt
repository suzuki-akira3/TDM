The log-Sobolev inequality with quadratic interactions
We assume one-site measures without a boundary e^{−ϕ(x)}dx/Z that satisfies a log-Sobolev inequality. We prove that if these measures are perturbed with quadratic interactions, then the associated infinite dimensional Gibbs measure on the lattice always satisfies a log-Sobolev inequality. Furthermore, we present examples of measures that satisfy the inequality with a phase that goes beyond convexity at infinity.
I. INTRODUCTION
We focus on the logarithmic Sobolev inequality for probability measures governing unbounded spin systems on the d-dimensional lattice Z^{d} (d ≥ 1) with quadratic interactions. The aim of this paper is to prove that, when the single-site measure without interactions (consisting only of the phase)
satisfies the log-Sobolev inequality, the Gibbs measure of the associated local specification E^{Λ,ω}{Λ⊂Z^{d},ω∈M^{∂Λ}}, with Hamiltonian
also satisfies a log-Sobolev inequality, when the interactions V are quadratic.
Since the main condition about the phase measure does not involve the local specification {E^{Λ}} nor the one-site measure E^{{i},ω}, we present a criterion for the infinite dimensional Gibbs measure inequality without assuming or proving the usual Dobrushin and Shlosman’s mixing conditions for the local specification, as in Ref [42] and more recently in Ref [33]. As a matter of fact, in order to control the boundary conditions involved in the interactions, we will make use of the U-bound inequalities introduced in Ref [24] in order to prove coercive inequalities in a standard non-statistical mechanics framework. As a result, we prove the inequality for a variety of phases extending beyond the usual Euclidean case, as well as involving measures with phase that go beyond the typical convexity at infinity.
For the investigation into criteria concerning the logarithmic Sobolev inequality for the infinite dimensional Gibbs measure of the local specification, E^{Λ,ω}{Λ⊂Z^{d},ω∈M^{∂Λ}}, two main approaches have been developed.
The first approach is based on proving that, first, the measures E^{Λ,ω}{Λ⊂Z^{d},ω∈M^{∂Λ}} satisfy a log-Sobolev inequality with a constant uniformity on the set Λ and the boundary conditions ω. Next, the inequality for the Gibbs measure follows directly from the uniform inequality for the local specification. Criteria for the local specification with which to uniformly satisfy a log-Sobolev inequality on the set Λ and the boundary conditions have been investigated in Refs [47],  [4],  [5],  [44],  [3],  [13],  [30], and  [25]. Similar results for the weaker spectral gap inequality have been obtained in Ref [20].
The second approach focuses on determining the inequality for the Gibbs measure directly, without first showing the stronger uniform inequality for the local specification. Such criteria concerning the local specification in the case of quadratic interactions for the infinite-dimensional Gibbs measure on the lattice have been investigated by Refs [46],  [47], and  [23].
The problem of passing from the single-site to the infinite dimensional measure, in the case of quadratic interactions, is addressed by Refs [32],  [27], and  [34]. What has been shown is that when the one-site measure E^{{i},ω} satisfies a log-Sobolev inequality uniformly on the boundary conditions, then in the presence of quadratic interactions the infinite Gibbs measure also satisfies a log-Sobolev inequality.
For the single-site measure, with or without boundaries, necessary and sufficient conditions for the log-Sobolev inequality to be satisfied are also presented in Refs [10],  [12],  [7], and  [39].
The scope of the current paper is to prove the log-Sobolev inequality for the Gibbs measure without setting conditions, either on the local specification {E^{Λ}} or on the one-site measure E^{{i},ω}. What we actually show is that, in the presence of quadratic interactions, the Gibbs measure always satisfies a log-Sobolev inequality whenever the boundary free one-site measure μ(dx) = e^{−ϕ(x)}dx/(∫e^{−ϕ(x)}dx) satisfies a log-Sobolev inequality. In this way, we improve the previous results, since the log-Sobolev inequality is determined alone by the phase ϕ of the simple measure μ on M, without interactions, for which a plethora of criteria and examples of good measures that satisfy the inequality exist.
II. GENERAL FRAMEWORK AND MAIN RESULT
We consider the d-dimensional integer lattice Z^{d} with the standard neighborhood notion, where two lattice points i,j∈Z^{d} are considered neighbours if their lattice distance is one; i.e., they are connected with an edge, in which case we write i ∼ j. We will also denote {∼i} for the set of all neighbours of a node i and ∂Λ the boundary of a set Λ⊂Z^{d}, that is, ∂Λ={j∈Z^{d}\Λ:j∼i for some i∈Λ}. Our configuration space is Ω=M^{Zd}, where M is the spin space.
We consider unbounded n-dimensional spin spaces M with the following structure. We shall assume that M is a nilpotent Lie group on R^{n} with a Hörmander system X^{1}, …, X^{N}, N ≤ n, of smooth vector fields X^{k}=∑j=1na_{kj}∂∂x_{j}, k = 1, …, N; i.e., a_{kj} are smooth functions of x∈R^{n}. The (sub)gradient ∇ with respect to this structure is the vector operator ∇f = (X^{1}f, …, X^{N}f). We consider
When these operators refer to a spin space M^{i} at a node i∈Z^{d}, this will be indicated by an index ∇_{i}f=(Xi1f,…,XiNf). For a subset Λ of Z^{d}, we define ∇_{Λ} ≔ (∇_{i}, i ∈ Λ) and
The spin space M is equipped with a metric d(x, y) for x, y ∈ M. For example, in the case where M is a Euclidean space, d is the Euclidean metric; or, if M is the Heisenberg group, then d is the Carnot-Carathéodory metric. We will consider examples and applications of the main theorem for both. In all cases, for x ∈ M, we will conventionally write d(x) for the distance of x from 0,
where 0 is a specific point of M, for example, the origin when M is R^{n} or the identity element of the group when M is a Lie group. Furthermore, we assume that there exists a k_{0} > 0 such that
For instance, in the Euclidean and the Carnot-Carathéodory metrics, k_{0} = 1.
A spin at a site i∈Z^{d} of a configuration ω ∈ Ω will be indicated by an index, i.e., we will write ω_{i}. This takes values in M^{i}, which is an identical copy of the spin space M. For a subset Λ⊂Z^{d}, we will identify M^{Λ} with the Cartesian product of the M^{i} for every i ∈ Λ.
The spin space M is equipped with a natural measure. For example, when M is a group, we assume that the measure is one which is invariant under the group operation, for which we write dx. Again, for any i∈Z^{d}, we use a subscript to indicate the natural measure dx_{i} on M^{i}. In the case of a Euclidean space or the Heisenberg group, for instance, this is the Lebesgue measure. For any finite subset Λ⊂Z^{d}, the product measure derived from dx_{i}, i ∈ Λ, we will write dx_{Λ} ≔ ⊗_{i∈Λ}dx_{i}. The measures of the local specification E^{Λ,ω} for Λ⊂Z^{d} and ω ∈ M^{∂Λ} are defined as
where
is a normalization constant. We assume Z^{Λ,ω} < ∞. The Hamiltonian function H^{Λ,ω} takes the form
We call ϕ the phase and V the interaction. We will assume that there exists a J∈R such that
Furthermore, we assume that
In this work, we exclusively consider quadratic interactions V, i.e.,
for some k ≥ 1 and λ ≥ 0.
For a function f from M^{Zd} into R, we will conventionally write E^{Λ,ω}f for the expectation of f with respect to E^{Λ,ω}. For economy, we will frequently omit the boundary conditions and write E^{Λ}f instead of E^{Λ,ω}. The measures of the local specification obey the Markov property
We state that the probability measure ν on Ω=M^{Zd} is an infinite volume Gibbs measure for the local specifications {E^{Λ,ω}} if it satisfies the Dobrushin-Lanford-Ruelle equation,
We refer to Refs [38],  [8], and  [16] for details. Throughout the paper, we shall assume that we are in the case where ν exists (uniqueness will be deduced from our results; see Proposition VII.2). It should be noted that the conditions placed on our main theorem are minimal and do not contradict the existence of Gibbs measures. For criteria concerning existence (as well as uniqueness) and examples of local specifications for unbounded spin systems on the lattice, one can look into Refs [8],  [21],  [9],  [29], and  [2] and the more recent papers, Refs [48] and  [31]. The examples of local specifications of unbounded spin systems on the lattice, as presented in the aforementioned papers, all have quadratic interactions V, as in (6). Furthermore, the phases ϕ increase at a sufficient speed such that the free one-site measures μ(dx)=e^{−ϕ(x)}dx∫e^{−ϕ(x)}dx satisfy a log-Sobolev inequality. This should not come as a surprise, since the existence (and also uniqueness) studied in these papers is examined mainly through the decay of correlations and the Dobrushin condition (see Refs [16–18]), which have been closely associated with the log-Sobolev inequality (see Refs [42],  [45],  [47], and  [33]). For this reason, in order to obtain relevant examples that fit into the framework of the current paper, one can consider local specifications with nearest neighbour interactions, with a phase and an interaction as in any of the examples presented in these papers, but with the additional condition that the coefficients J_{ij} of the interactions are sufficiently small. For instance, one can consider a local specification on R^{Z2} with a Hamiltonian (3) with J sufficiently small, interactions V(x, y) = |x − y|^{s}, for 1 < s ≤ 2, and a phase ϕ(x) = x^{2} + |x|^{r}, for r ≥ 3, or ϕ the double well potential ϕ(x) = ax^{4} − x^{2} for some a > 0. In turn, we know that, for these local specifications, infinite volume Gibbs measures exist.
Furthermore, we will consider functions f:M^{Zd}→R such that fd ∈ L_{2}(ν).
The main interest of the paper is the logarithmic Sobolev inequality. We say that a probability measure μ in M satisfies the logarithmic Sobolev inequality, if there exists a constant c > 0, such that
We notice two important properties for the log-Sobolev inequality. The first is that it implies the spectral gap inequality; that is, there exists a constant c′ ≤ c such that
The second is that both the log-Sobolev and the spectral gap inequality are retained under product measures with the same constant. Proofs of these two assertions can be found in the studies of Gross [22], Guionnet and Zegarlinski [23], and Bobkov and Zegarlinski [12].
Under the spin system framework, the log-Sobolev inequality for the local specification {E^{Λ,ω}} takes the form
where the constant c is now uniformly required on the subset Λ and the boundary conditions ω ∈ ∂Λ. In the special case where Λ = {i}, the constant is considered uniformly on the boundary conditions ω ∈{∼i}. The analogue log-Sobolev inequality for the infinite volume Gibbs measure ν is then defined as
The aim of this paper is to show that the infinite volume Gibbs measure ν satisfies the log-Sobolev inequality (9) for an appropriate constant. As explained in the Introduction, in the case of quadratic interactions, previous studies concentrated on either proving first the stronger (8) for all Λ⊂Z^{d} or assuming the log-Sobolev inequality (8) for the one-site Λ = i and then derived (9).
Our aim is to show that, if we assume the weaker inequality (7) for the phase measure μ(dx)=e^{−ϕ(x)}dx∫e^{−ϕ(x)}dx, in the presence of quadratic interaction, this is sufficient to directly obtain the log-Sobolev inequality for the Gibbs measure (9), without the need to assume or prove any of the stronger inequalities (8) that require uniformity on the boundary conditions and/or the dimension of the measure.
For a distance d and a (sub)gradient ∇ satisfying (D0) and a local specification, as in (1)–(6), the first result of the paper follows:
Theorem II.1. Assume a local specification as in (1)–(5) and that the distance d and the (sub)gradient ∇ satisfy (D0). Assume that the measureμ(dx)=e^{−ϕ(x)}dx∫e^{−ϕ(x)}dxin M satisfies the log-Sobolev inequality and that the local specification has quadratic interactions V as in (6). Then, for J sufficiently small, the infinite volume Gibbs measure inM^{Zd}satisfies a log-Sobolev inequality.Since the main hypothesis of the theorem only requires the measure μ(dx)=e^{−ϕ(x)}dx∫e^{−ϕ(x)}dx to satisfy a logarithmic Sobolev inequality, we can now easily obtain local specifications with a Gibbs measure that satisfies the log-Sobolev inequality. We can consider any of the probability measures from R^{n}, which satisfy a log-Sobolev inequality, and obtain measures for the statistical mechanics framework of spin systems on the lattice Z^{d} just by adding quadratic interactions as described in (6).From the plethora of theorems and criteria that have been developed for the Euclidean R^{n} for n ≥ 1, among others in Refs [11],  [4],  [5],  [10], and  [12], one can generalise these to the spin system framework just by applying them to the phase ϕ and then adding quadratic interactions V. As an example, one can consider for the Euclidean space n ≥ 1 with d the Euclidean metric, X_{i}=∂∂x_{j} and dx_{i} the Lebesgue measure, the following example of measures: Consider the phase ϕ(x)=‖x‖pp for any p ≥ 2 and interactions V(x,y)=‖x−y‖22. Then the associated Gibbs measure satisfies a logarithmic Sobolev inequality.Furthermore, as will be described in Theorem II.2, which follows, with additional assumptions about the distance and the gradient, we can obtain results comparable to the ones obtained in Ref [24] for general metric spaces. We consider general n-dimensional non-compact metric spaces. For the distance d and the (sub)gradient ∇, in addition to the hypothesis of Theorem II.1, we assume that
for some σ ∈ [1, ∞), and
outside the unit ball {d(x) < 1} for some K ∈ (0, + ∞). We also assume that the gradient ∇ satisfies the integration by parts formula. For this to hold, in the case of ∇f = (X^{1}f, …, X^{N}f) with vector fields X^{k}=∑j=1na_{kj}∂∂x_{j}, it suffices to request that a_{kj} is a function of x∈R^{d} not depending on the jth coordinate x_{j}.If dx is the n-dimensional Lebesgue measure, we assume that it satisfies the classical Sobolev (C-S) inequality
for positive constants α, β, as well as the Poincaré inequality on the ball B_{R}; that is, there exists a constant c_{R} ∈ (0, ∞) such that
The classical Sobolev inequality (C-S) is, for instance, satisfied in the case of the R^{n},n≥1 with d being the Euclidean distance, as well as in the case of the Heisenberg group with d being the Carnot-Carathéodory distance. The Poincaré inequality on the ball for the Lebesgue measure (L-P) is a standard result for n ≥ 3 (see, for instance, Refs [25],  [24],  [16], and  [43]), while for n = 1, 2, one can look into Ref [36]. Under this framework, if we combine our main result, Theorem II.1, together with Corollary 3.1 and Theorem 4.1 from Ref [24], we obtain the following theorem:
Theorem II.2. Assume a local specification as in (1)–(5) and that the distance d and the (sub)gradient ∇ are such that (D1)-(D2) are satisfied. Assume (C-S) and (L-P) and define a probability measureμ(dx)=e^{−ϕ(x)}dx∫e^{−ϕ(x)}dx, where dx is the Lebesgue measure, such that ϕ(x) = W(x) + B(x) is defined with a differential potential W satisfying
with p ≥ 2 and q being the conjugate of p, and suppose that B is a measurable function such that osc(B) = max B − min B < ∞. Assume that the local specification{E^{Λ,ω}}has quadratic interactions V as in (6). Then, for J sufficiently small, the infinite volume Gibbs measure satisfies a log-Sobolev inequality.An interesting application of the last theorem is the special case of the Heisenberg group, H. This can be described as R^{3} with the following group operation:
H is a Lie group, and its Lie algebra h can be identified with the space of left invariant vector fields on H in the standard way. The vector fields
form a Jacobian basis, where ∂_{xi} denotes derivation with respect to x_{i}. From this, it is clear that X_{1}, X_{2} satisfy the Hörmander condition (i.e., X_{1}, X_{2} and their commutator [X_{1}, X_{2}] span the tangent space at every point of H). The sub-gradient is given by ∇ ≔ (X_{1}, X_{2}). For more details, one can look at Ref [14]. In Ref [27], a first example of a measure on the Heisenberg group with a Gibbs measure that satisfies a logarithmic Sobolev inequality was presented. Here, with the use of Theorem II.2, we can obtain examples with a phase ϕ, which is nowhere convex and includes more natural quadratic interactions. Such an example, which satisfies the conditions of Theorem II.2 with a phase that goes beyond convexity at infinity, is as follows: If d is the Carnot-Carathéodory distance, consider the phase and interaction as
where ⋅ is the group operation and y^{−1} is the inverse with respect to this operation. As a result of the above theorem, one can obtain the usual hypercontractivity properties and Talagrand type inequalities for the associated generator related to log-Sobolev inequalities, as studied in Refs [23] and  [6] (see also Refs [19],  [28], and  [27] for relevant ergodic results).The proof of Theorem II.1 is divided into two parts, as presented in Propositions II.3 and II.4. In the first one, we prove a weaker assertion that the claim of Theorem II.1 is true under the conditions of Theorem II.1, together with the U-bound inequality (10).
Proposition II.3. Assume that the measureμ(dx)=e^{−ϕ(x)}dx∫e^{−ϕ(x)}dxsatisfies the log-Sobolev inequality and that the local specification{E^{Λ,ω}}has quadratic interactions V as in (6). Furthermore, assume that there exists a C ≥ 1 such that the following U-bound inequality is satisfied:
Then, for J sufficiently small, the infinite dimensional Gibbs measure satisfies the log-Sobolev inequality.The proof of this proposition will be presented in Subsection VII A. Then, Theorem II.1 follows on from Proposition II.3, and the next proposition stating that the conditions of Theorem II.1 imply the U-bound inequality (10) of Proposition II.3.
Proposition II.4. Assume that the measureμ(dx)=e^{−ϕ(x)}dx∫e^{−ϕ(x)}dxsatisfies the log-Sobolev inequality and that the local specification{E^{Λ,ω}}has quadratic interactions V as in (6). Then, for J sufficiently small, the Gibbs measure satisfies the U-bound inequality (10).Let us offer a few words about the structure of the paper. Since the proof of the main result presented in Theorem II.1 trivially follows on from Propositions II.3 and II.4, we concentrate on showing the validity of these two.For simplicity, we will present the proof for the two-dimensional lattice Z^{2}. At first, the proof of Proposition II.4 will be presented in Sec. III. The proof of Proposition II.3 will occupy the rest of the paper. In particular, in Sec. IV, a sweeping out inequality will be shown as well as a spectral gap type inequality for the one-site measure. In Sec. V, a second sweeping out inequality is proven. In Sec. VI, logarithmic Sobolev type inequalities for the one-site measure as well as for the infinite product measure are proven. Then, in Sec. VII, we present a spectral gap type inequality for the product measure directly from the log-Sobolev inequality shown in Sec. VI. Using this, we show convergence to the Gibbs measure as well as its uniqueness. Then, in the final part of the section, in Subsection VII A, we put all the previous elements together to prove Proposition II.3.
III. PROOF OF THE U-BOUND INEQUALITY
U-bound inequalities were introduced in Ref [24] (see also Ref [26]) in order to prove q logarithmic Sobolev inequalities. It was actually shown that for a measure μ(dx)=e^{−ϕ(x)}∫e^{−ϕ(x)}dx to satisfy the logarithmic Sobolev inequality, it is necessary for the following U-bound inequality to hold
In the special case where ϕ(x) = d^{p}(x) for p ≥ 2, this U-bound takes the form μ(f^{2}d^{2p−2}) ≤ Cμ(f^{2}) + Cμ∥∇f∥^{2}. As for the Poincaré inequality, the appropriate U-bound is μ(f^{2}d) ≤ Cμ(f^{2}) + Cμ∥∇f∥^{2}. In this work, we use similar U-bound inequalities in order to control the quadratic interactions. In this section, we prove Proposition II.4 that states that if the measure μ(dx)=e^{−ϕ(x)}∫e^{−ϕ(x)}dx satisfies the log-Sobolev inequality and the local specification has quadratic interactions, then the U-bound inequality (10) holds.
Lemma III.1. If μ satisfies the log-Sobolev inequality and the local specification has quadratic interactions V as in (6), then for anyi∈Z^{2},
for positive constants K_{0}and K_{1}.
Proof. If we use the following entropic inequality (see Ref [15])
for any probability measure π and v ≥ 0, πv = 1, we get
For the first term on the right-hand side of (12), we can use Theorem 4.5 from Ref [24] (see also Ref [1]) which states that when a measure μ satisfies the log-Sobolev inequality then for any function g such that ∥∇g∥^{2} ≤ ag + b, for a, b ∈ (0, ∞), we have that μe^{tg} < ∞ for t sufficiently small. Since
because of hypothesis (D0), we obtain that for t sufficiently small
for some K > 0. From this and the fact that μ(dx) satisfies the log-Sobolev inequality (7) with some constant c, (12) becomes
If we substitute f by fe^{−Vi2}, where we denote V^{i} = ∑_{j∼i}J_{i,j}V (x_{i}, ω_{j}), we get
For the second term of the right-hand side of (13), we have
If we substitute this into (13) and divide both parts with Z^{i,ω} to create the measure E^{i,ω} and then take the expectation with respect to the Gibbs measure ν, we obtain
where above we used that ν(E^{i,ω}f)=ν(f). From our main assumption (6) about the interactions, ∥∇_{i}V (x_{i}, ω_{j})∥^{2} ≤ λ + kd^{2}(x_{i}) + kd^{2}(ω_{i}), we have that
which leads to
For J sufficiently small so that 8ckJ^{2}t<1 and 2ckJ^{2}t+24c^{2}kJ^{4}t<3ckJ^{2}t⇒2ckJ^{2}t1−8ckJ^{2}t<3ckJ^{2}t, we obtain
and the lemma follows for appropriate constants K_{0} and K_{1}.In the next lemma, we show a technical calculation of an iteration that will be used.
Lemma III.2. Assume functionsP,R:Z^{2}→Rsuch that for anyj∈Z^{2},
for some b > 0 and some s ∈ (0, 1) sufficiently small, and
Then
for anyk∈Z^{2}.
Proof. We will first show that for any n∈N there exists an s ∈ (0, 1) such that
We will work by induction.Step 1: The base step of the induction (n = 1). At first take the sum over all neighbours of k in (14) and then bound ∑_{dist(t,k)=1}∑_{i∼t}P(i) ≤ 2∑_{dist(t,k)=2}P(t) + 4P(k) to get
If we use again (14) to bound the last term, we obtain
For s < 1 small enough so that 4bs^{2}≤3⇒11−4b^{2}s^{4}≤11−3bs^{2} and 4bs^{2}+4b^{2}s^{5}<s⇒4bs^{2}1−4b^{2}s^{4}≤s, we have
This proves the base step.Step 2: The induction step. We assume that (16) holds true for some n ≥ 2, and we will show that it is true for n + 1. We start by taking the sum over all j: dist(j, k) = n + 1 in (14),
where above we also used that ∑_{dist(j,k)=n+1}∑_{t∼j}P(t) ≤ 3∑_{dist(j,k)=n}P(j) + 2∑_{dist(j,k)=n+2}P(j). If we bound ∑_{dist(j,k)=n}P(j) by (16), we get
For s small enough such that 3bs^{2} < 1, 3bs^{2}1−3bs^{3}≤s, and 3b(s^{2}+s^{3}+s^{4})≤9b^{2}s^{6}+s⇒3bs^{2}(1−3bs^{3})(1−3bs^{2})≤s, we obtain
which finishes the proof of (16).We can now complete the proof of the lemma. At first, we can bound the second term on the right-hand side of (14) by (16). This gives
for s sufficiently small so that bs^{2}1−3bs^{2}≤s. If we use again (16) to bound the third term on the right-hand side, we have
where above we used once more that bs^{2}1−3bs^{2}≤s. If we continue inductively to bound the right-hand side by (16) and take into account (15), then for s sufficiently small such that sb < 1 we obtain
which proves the lemma.We now prove the U-bound inequality of Proposition II.4.
A. Proof of Proposition II.4
Proof. The proof of the proposition follows directly from Lemmas III.1 and III.2. If one considers P(k) ≔ ν(d^{2}(x_{k})f^{2}) and R(k) ≔ K_{0}ν(f^{2}) + K_{0}ν∥∇_{k}f∥^{2}, then from Lemma III.1, condition (14) is satisfied for b≔K_{1}=3ck^{2}t and s = J.Furthermore, since by hypothesis ν(d^{2}(x_{i})f^{2}) ≤ M < ∞ for some positive M uniformly on i, and {#j: dist(j, k) = n} ≤ 4^{n}, we can choose J sufficiently small so that for s=J<14, condition (15) of Lemma III.2 to be also satisfied,
Since (14) and (15) are satisfied, we can apply Lemma III.2. We then obtain
where above we choose J small enough so that 4J<1⇒∑n=0∞(4J){n}=1(1−4J). This finishes the proof of the proposition.
IV. FIRST SWEEPING OUT INEQUALITY
Sweeping out inequalities for the local specification were introduced in Refs [46],  [47], and  [23] to prove logarithmic Sobolev inequalities. Here we prove a weaker version of them for the Gibbs measure, similar to the ones used in Refs [35] and  [37], where, however, interactions higher than quadratic were considered.
Lemma IV.1. Assume that the measure μ satisfies the log-Sobolev inequality and that the local specification has quadratic interactions V as in (6). Then, for J sufficiently small, for every j ∼ i,
for some constant D_{1} ∈ [1, ∞).
Proof. Consider the (sub)gradient ∇_{j}=(X1j,X2j,…,XNj). We can then write
If we denote ρ_{i}=e^{−H(xi)}∫e^{−H(xi)}dx the density of the measure E^{i} and use the Leibnitz rule for the vector field Xjk, for every k = 1, …, N, we have
where in (18) we bounded the coefficients J_{i,j} by J, from (4), and we denoted E^{i}(f;g), the covariance of f and g. If we take expectations with respect to the Gibbs measure ν and use the Hölder inequality to bound each one of the two terms in (18), we obtain
Since ‖∇jV(xj,xi)‖{2}=∑k=1N(Xjk(V(xj,xi))){2}, if we take the sum over all k from 1 to N in the last inequality and then use hypothesis (6) to bound the gradient of the quadratic interactions, we obtain
For the fourth term on the right-hand side of (19), we can use Proposition II.4,
We can bound the last term by ν‖∇r(f−Eif)‖{2}≤2ν‖∇rf‖{2}+2ν‖∇r(Eif)‖{2}. But ∇_{r}(E^{i}f)=E^{i}(∇_{r}f) when dist(r, i) > 1, and ∇_{i}(E^{i}f)=0. Furthermore, since j ∼ i, when dist(r, j) = n, the r’s in the sum that neighbour i will have distance from j equal to 2 when r ≠ j or 0 when r = j. So (20) becomes
In order to bound the third term T_{3} on the right-hand side of (19), we will work as in the bound of T_{4}, using again Proposition II.4. Then, we get
If we combine together (19), (22), and (21), we obtain
where above we used that J^{2} < J, from (4), and that for any two neighbouring nodes α ∼ β,
If we take the sum over all j ∼ i in both sides of the inequality, we will obtain
If we choose J sufficiently small so that 32kCJ^{2} < 1, we get
Plugging the last bound into (23), we finally get
If we choose J small enough so that (λ+2kC)8J^{2}1−32kJ^{2}C≤1⇔(λ+2kC)8J^{2}+32kJ^{2}C≤1, 32kCJ1−32kJ^{2}C≤1⇔32kCJ+32kJ^{2}C≤1, and 2+8kCJ^{2}1−32kJ^{2}C≤3⇔8kCJ^{2}+96kJ^{2}C≤1, the proof of the lemma is completed for a constant D_{1}.Furthermore if we combine together (21) and Lemma IV.1, we obtain the following corollary.
Corollary IV.2. Assume that the measure μ satisfies the log-Sobolev inequality and that the local specification has quadratic interactions V as in (6). Then, for J sufficiently small, for every j ∼ i, the following holds
for some constant D_{2} > 0.Next we prove the spectral gap type inequality for the expectation with respect to the Gibbs measure of the one-site variance νE^{i}|f−E^{i}f|^{2}. To do this, we will bound the variance inside a compact ball and outside. The part of the proof that relates to the Poincaré inequality on the ball follows the proof of the local Poincaré inequalities from Refs [41] and  [43].
Lemma IV.3. Assume that the measure μ satisfies the log-Sobolev inequality and that the local specification has quadratic interactions V as in (6). Then, for J sufficiently small, the following spectral gap type inequality holds
for some constant D_{4} ≥ 1.
Proof. Define η(i, ω) ≔ d(x_{i}) + ∑_{j∼i}d(ω_{j}) and the set A^{ω}(L) ≔ {x_{i} ∈ M: η(i, ω) ≤ L}. Denote m_{i}(f)≔1|A^{ω}(L)|∫_{A^{ω}(L)}f(z_{i})dz_{i}, where |A^{ω}(L)|≔∫_{A^{ω}(L)}dx_{i}. Also denote I_{A} the indicator of a set A. Since for every m∈R, we can bound the variance of a function f with respect to a measure μ by μ(f − μf)^{2} ≤ 4μ(f − m)^{2}, we can write
where above we used that νE^{i,ω}f=νf. We will first bound B_{1}. Because of (4)–(6), we have H^{i,ω} ≥ 0 and so we can bound the density ρ_{i}=e^{−Hi,ω}∫e^{−Hi,ωdxi}dx_{i} of E^{i} by ρ_{i}≤1Z^{i,ω}. This leads to
If we use the invariance of the dx_{i} measure with respect to the group operation, we can write m_{i}(f)=1|A^{ω}(L)|∫f(x_{i}z_{i})I_{A^{ω}(L)}(x_{i}z_{i})dz_{i}. If we substitute this expression in (26) and then use the Cauchy-Swarz inequality, we get
where above we have considered L sufficiently large so that |A^{ω}(L)| > 1 and so 1|A^{ω}(L)|^{2}≤|A^{ω}(L)|. Consider γ: [0, t] → M a geodesic from 0 to z_{i} such that |γ̇(t)|≤1. Then for t = d(z_{i}), we can write
From the last inequality and (27), we get
We observe that for x_{i} ∈ A^{ω}(L) and x_{i}z_{i} ∈ A^{ω}(L) we can bound d(z_{i})=d(xi−1x_{i}z_{i})≤d(xi−1)+d(x_{i}z_{i})≤d(x_{i})+d(x_{i}z_{i})≤2L, and so
Similarly, for x_{i} ∈ A^{ω}(L) and x_{i}z_{i} ∈ A^{ω}(L), we calculate η(i, ω) (z_{i}) = d(z_{i}) + ∑_{j∼i}d(ω_{j}) ≤ d(x_{i}) + d(x_{i}z_{i}) + ∑_{j∼i}d(ω_{j}) ≤ 2L. If we use again that d(x_{i}γ(s)) ≤ d(γ(s)) + d(x_{i}), we also get η(i, ω) (x_{i}γ(s)) ≤ d(z_{i}) + d(x_{i}) + ∑_{j∼i}d(ω_{j}) ≤ 3L. So, we can write
Using again the invariance of the dx_{i} measure
For x_{i} ∈ A^{ω}(3L), since d^{2}(x_{i}) ≤ 9L^{2} and d^{2}(ω_{j}) ≤ 9L^{2}, the Hamiltonian is bounded by
because of (6). So e^{−Hi,ω}≥e^{−FL}, which gives the following bound:
If we take into account that |A^{ω}(2L)||A^{ω}(L)|≥1, as well as that |A^{ω}(2L)||A^{ω}(L)|→1 as ∑_{j∼i}d(ω_{j})→∞, we observe that |A^{ω}(2L)||A^{ω}(L)| is bounded from the above uniformly on ω from a constant. Thus, we finally obtain that
for some positive constant D_{L}.We will now bound B_{2}. Since d(x)=d(x)I_{{d(x)≤1}}+d(x)I_{{d(x)>1}}≤1+d^{2}(x), we can bound η(i, ω) = d(x_{i}) + ∑_{j∼i}d(ω_{j}) ≤ 5 + d^{2}(x_{i}) + ∑_{j∼i}d^{2}(ω_{j}), and so
We can bound the first and second term on the right-hand side from Proposition II.4 to get
If we choose L sufficiently large so that 5+5CL<1, we finally obtain
for some constant D_{3} > 0. If we combine together (25) with the two bounds (28) and (29), the proof of the lemma is completed.If we combine Lemma IV.3 and Corollary IV.2, we also have
Corollary IV.4. Assume that μ satisfies the log-Sobolev inequality and that the local specification has quadratic interactions V as in (6). Then, for J sufficiently small, the following holds
for some constant D_{5} ≥ 1.The following lemma provides the sweeping out inequality for the one-site measure.
Lemma IV.5. Assume that the measure μ satisfies the log-Sobolev inequality and that the local specification has quadratic interactions V as in (6). Then, for J sufficiently small, for every j ∼ i,
for a constant G_{1} ∈ [1, ∞).
Proof. Combining Lemmas IV.3 and IV.1 together, we obtain the following:
Take into account (24) and the lemma follows for G_{1} = D_{1} + D_{1}D_{4}.Define the following sets:
where dist(i, j) refers to the distance of the shortest path (number of vertices) between two nodes i and j. Note that dist(i, j) > 1 for all i, j ∈ Γ_{k}, k = 0, 1 and Γ_{0} ∩ Γ_{1} = ∅. Moreover Z^{2}=Γ_{0}∪Γ_{1}. In the next proposition, we will prove a sweeping out inequality for the product measures E^{Γ0}.
Proposition IV.6. Assume that the measure μ satisfies the log-Sobolev inequality and that the local specification has quadratic interactions V as in (6). Then, for J sufficiently small, the following sweeping out inequality is true:
for constants R_{1} ∈ [1, ∞) and0<R_{2}≤JG_{6}1−4J<1.
Proof. Denote {i_{1}, i_{2}, i_{3}, i_{4}} ≔ {∼i} the neighbours of node i. We can write
We can now use Lemma IV.5 to get the following:
We will compute the second term in the right-hand side of (32). For n = 1, we have
In addition, denote i_{kl} the node of distance two from i that neighbours i_{k} and i_{l}. Also with ik′ the node of distance two from i which neighbours only with one of the neighbours of i, the i_{k}, where k=1,2,3,4. Then, for n = 2, we distinguish between the nodes r in {dist(r, i) = 2} that neighbour only one of the neighbours {i_{2}, i_{3}, i_{4}} of i, which are the i2′, i3′, i4′, i_{12}, i_{14}, and those that neighbour two of the nodes in {i_{2}, i_{3}, i_{4}}, which are the i_{23} and i_{34} neighbouring i_{2}, i_{3} and i_{3}, i_{4}, respectively. We can then write
To bound the second term on the right-hand side of (34), for any r ∈ {i2′, i3′, i4′, i_{12}, i_{14}} neighbouring the node t ∈ {i_{2}, i_{3}, i_{4}}, we use Lemma IV.5 to get
which leads to
Since for nodes r: dist(r, i) = 2, the nodes s such that dist(s, r) = n have distance from i equal to |n − 2|, n, or n + 2, we get
To bound the first term on the right-hand side of (34), for example, for r = i_{23} neighbouring the nodes i_{2} and i_{3}, we use again Lemma IV.5,
The first term for n = 0 on the sum of (36) can be bounded from Lemma IV.5,
The terms for n = 1 on the sum of (36) become
The terms for n = 2 on the sum of (36) can be divided into those that neighbour i_{3} and those that do not. Since for the nodes s that do not neighbour i_{3}, i.e., s: dist(s, i_{23}) = 2, s ≁ i_{3}, we get ν‖∇_{s}(E^{i3}f)‖^{2}≤ν‖∇_{s}f‖^{2} and we can bound
While for the first term on the right-hand side, we can use again Lemma IV.5,
From the last two inequalities, we obtain the following bound for the terms for n = 2 on the sum of (36),
Finally, for the terms for n > 2 on the sum on the right-hand side of (36), we get
If we substitute (37)–(40) in (36), we have
for G_{2}=4G12+3G_{1}. Exactly the same bound can be obtained for the other term, ν‖∇_{i34}(E^{{i2,i3,i4}}f)‖^{2}, on the first sum of the right-hand side of (34). Gathering together (34), (35), and (41) leads to
for G_{3} = 8G_{1} + 2G_{2}. Furthermore, for every r: dist(r, i) ≥ 3, we have
Finally, if we substitute (33), (42), and (43) in (32), we obtain
for a constant G_{4} = G_{1}G_{3} + G_{1}. If we repeat the same calculation recursively for the first term on the right-hand side of (44), then for ν‖∇_{i}(E^{{i3,i4}}f)‖^{2} and ν‖∇_{i}(E^{{i4}}f)‖^{2} we will finally obtain
for a constant G_{5} > 1. From the last inequality and (31), we get
for a constant R_{2}≤G_{5}J(∑k=0∞(4J){k})≤JG_{5}1−4J<1, for J sufficiently small such that J<min{14,1C_{5}+4}.
V. SECOND SWEEPING OUT RELATIONS
In this section, we prove the second sweeping out relation. We start by first proving in the next lemma the second sweeping out relation between two neighbouring nodes.
Lemma V.1. Assume that the measure μ satisfies the log-Sobolev inequality and that the local specification has quadratic interactions V as in (6). Then, for J sufficiently small, for every i ∼ j, the following sweeping out inequality holds
for R_{3} ≥ 1.
Proof. Consider the (sub)gradient ∇_{i}=(X1i,X2i,…,XNi). We can then write
But from relationship (17) of Lemma IV.1, if we put f^{2} in f, we have
where ρ_{j} is the density of E^{j}. We can bound the first term above by the Cauchy-Swartz inequality
while for the second term, we will use the following inequality (see Ref [35]): For any probability measure μ and measurable functions f, g, the following holds
for some constant c̃ uniformly on the boundary conditions. If we use this inequality to bound the second term and then put everything together in (45), we obtain
where above we abbreviated f−E^{j}f as f_{j}. If we take the expectation with respect to the Gibbs measure and bound ∥∇_{i}V (x_{j}, x_{i})∥^{2} by (6), we get
If we bound the second term on the right-hand side by Lemma IV.3 and the third and fourth term by Corollary IV.4, we get
For the first term on the right-hand side of (46), we can write νfj2E^{j}d^{2}(x_{j})=νE^{j}(fj2)d^{2}(x_{j}) and then apply the U-bound inequality (10) of Proposition II.3,
In order to bound the variance on the first term, ν(E^{j}(fj2))=νE^{j}(f−Ej(f)){2}, we can use the spectral gap type inequality of Lemma IV.3,
For n = 0, the term of the second sum is zero. For n > 1, the nodes r: dist(r, j) = n do not neighbour with j, so we have
because of the Cauchy-Swartz inequality. Putting together (47), (48), and (46), we get
for a constant D_{6} > 0. If we replace f by f_{j}=f−E^{j}f in (49), since D_{r}(f_{j})=D_{r}(f−E^{j}f)=D_{r}(f), we have that
where above we also bounded ν‖∇rfj‖{2}=ν‖∇r(f−Ejf)‖{2}≤2ν‖∇rf‖{2}+2ν‖∇r(Ejf)‖{2}. If we use Lemma IV.5 to bound the second and fourth term on the right-hand side of the last inequality, we obtain
Since r in the last term neighbours j, we can use (24) to bound the sum over s: dist(s, r) = n in the last term by a sum over s: dist(s, j) = n. In addition, summing in both sides over all i such that i ∼ j gives
for a constant D_{7} = 24D_{6}G_{1} + 2D_{6}. For J sufficiently small so that 11−4D_{6}J^{3}<2, we obtain
If we use the last inequality to bound the last term on the right-hand side of (49), together with the bound (24), we obtain
This finishes the proof for an appropriate constant R_{3} ≥ 1.In the next proposition, we will extend the sweeping out relations of the last lemma from the two neighboring nodes to the two infinite dimensional disjoint sets Γ_{0} and Γ_{1}.
Proposition V.2. Assume that the measure μ satisfies the log-Sobolev inequality and that the local specification has quadratic interactions V as in (6). Then, for J sufficiently small, the following sweeping out inequality holds
for {i, j} = {0, 1} and constants C_{1} ∈ [1, ∞) and 0 < C_{2} < 1.
Proof. The proof follows on the same line as the proof of Proposition IV.6. If we denote {∼i} = {i_{1}, i_{2}, i_{3}, i_{4}} the neighbours of note i and apply Lemma V.1, we can bound
We will compute the term on the right-hand side of (51) for n = 1,
For n = 2, we distinguish between the nodes r in {dist(r, i) = 2} that neighbour only one of the neighbours {i_{2}, i_{3}, i_{4}} of i, which are the i2′, i3′, i4′, i_{12}, i_{14}, and those that neighbour two of the nodes in {i_{2}, i_{3}, i_{4}}, which are the i_{23} and i_{34}, neighbouring i_{2}, i_{3} and i_{3}, i_{4}, respectively. We can then write
To bound the second term on the right hand side of (53), for any r ∈ {i2′, i3′, i4′, i_{12}, i_{14}} neighbouring a node t ∈ {i_{2}, i_{3}, i_{4}}, we can use Lemma V.1,
Now take the sum over r = i2′, i3′, i4′, i_{12}, i_{14}. Since for nodes r: dist(r, i) = 2, the nodes s such that dist(s, r) = n have distance from i equal to n − 2, n, or n + 2, we get
To bound the first term on the right-hand side of (53), for example, for r = i_{23} neighbouring the nodes i_{2} and i_{3}, since ν‖∇_{i23}(E{i2,i3,i4}f2){12}‖^{2}≤ν‖∇_{i23}(E{i2,i3}f2){12}‖^{2}, we can use again Lemma V.1,
The first term on the right-hand side of (55) can be bounded from Lemma V.1,
The term for n = 1 in the sum in the second term on the right-hand side of (55) becomes
The terms for n = 2 on the second sum of (55) can be divided into those that neighbour i_{23} and those that do not,
For the second term on the right-hand side of (58),
while for the first term on the right hand side of (58), we can use Lemma V.1,
From (58)–(60), we get the following bound for the terms for n = 2 on the sum of (55):
For every s: dist(s, i_{3}) ≥ 3, we have ν‖∇_{s}(Ei3f2){12}‖^{2}≤ν‖∇_{s}f‖^{2}, which gives
since dist(i_{23}, i) = 2. Substituting (56), (57), (61), and (62) in (55) leads to
for R_{4}=2R_{3}+5R32. The exact same bound can be obtained for the other term on the first sum of the right-hand side of (53). Gathering together (53), (54), and (63) leads to
for R_{5} = 8R_{3} + R_{4}. Furthermore, for every r: dist(r, i) ≥ 3, ν‖∇_{r}(E{i2,i3,i4}f2){12}‖^{2}≤ν‖∇_{r}f‖^{2}. From this, together with (52), (64), and (51), we obtain
for constant R_{6} = R_{3} + R_{3}R_{5}. If we repeat the same calculation recursively, for the first term on the right-hand side of (65), then for ν‖∇_{i}(E{i3,i4}f2){12}‖^{2} and ν‖∇_{i}(E{i4}f2){12}‖^{2} we will finally obtain
for a constant R_{6}. From the last inequality and (51), we get
for a constant C_{2}≤JR_{6}(∑k=0∞(4J){k})≤JR_{6}1−4J for J sufficiently small such that J<14 and J<1R_{6}−4 the proof of the proposition follows for C_{2} < 1.
VI. LOG-SOBOLEV TYPE INEQUALITIES
In this paper, we do not assume the log-Sobolev inequality for the one-site measure E^{i,ω}, but the weaker inequality for the measure μ(dx_{i})=e^{−ϕ(xi)}dx/(∫e^{−ϕ(xi)}dx_{i}). Still, in this section, we will show that when the interactions are quadratic we can obtain a weaker log-Sobolev type inequality for the E^{i,ω} measure. This will be the object of the next proposition.
Proposition VI.1. Assume that the measure μ satisfies the log-Sobolev inequality and that the local specification has quadratic interactions V as in (6). Then, for J sufficiently small, the one-site measureE^{i,ω}satisfies the following log-Sobolev type inequality:
for some positive constant c_{1}.
Proof. We work as in Ref [37]. Assume g ≥ 0. We start with our main assumption that the measure μ(dx)=e^{−ϕ(x)}dx∫e^{−ϕ(x)}dx satisfies the log-Sobolev inequality for a constant c_{0}, that is,
We will interpolate this inequality to create the entropy with respect to the one-site measure E^{i,ω} on the left-hand side. For this, put g=e^{−Vi2}f,f≥0 in (66), where V^{i} = ∑_{j∼i}J_{i,j}V (x_{i}, ω_{j}), to get
Denote by S_{r} and S_{l} the right- and left-hand side of (67), respectively. Use the Leibnitz rule for the gradient on the right-hand side to bound ‖∇_{i}(e^{−Vi2}f)‖^{2}≤2e^{−Vi}‖∇_{i}f‖^{2}+12e^{−Vi}f^{2}‖∇_{i}V^{i}‖^{2} so that
On the left-hand side of (67), we form the entropy for the measure E^{i,ω} with Hamiltonian H^{i} = ϕ(x_{i}) + V^{i},
Since from (4) and (6), V^{i} is no negative, the last equality leads to
If we combine (67) together with (68) and (69), we obtain
From Refs [12] and  [40], the following estimate of the entropy holds
for some positive constant A. If we use (70) to bound the second term on the right-hand side above and then take the expectation with respect to the Gibbs measure, we have
where once more we wrote f_{i}≔f−E^{i,ω}f. If we use (6) to bound V and ∥∇_{i}V ∥^{2}, we get
We can bound the first term by Lemma IV.3 and the last one by Corollary IV.4 to get
which finishes the proof of the proposition for c_{1} = (A + 4Jλ(1 + c_{0}))4(D_{L} + D_{3}) + 6(2c_{0} + 1)kD_{5}.We now prove a log-Sobolev type inequality for the product measure E^{Γk} for k = 0, 1.
Proposition VI.2. Assume that the measure μ satisfies the log-Sobolev inequality and that the local specification has quadratic interactions V as in (6). Then, for J sufficiently small, the following log-Sobolev type inequality for the product measuresE^{Γk,ω}holds
for k = 0, 1 and some positive constantC̃.
Proof. We will prove the statement of the proposition for k = 1. In the proof of this proposition, we will use the following estimation. For any i∈Z with neighbours {∼i} = i_{1}, i_{2}, i_{3}, i_{4}, denote
and
From the calculations of the components of the sum of Θ(i) in the proof of Proposition V.2 and the recursive inequality (65), we can surmise that there exists an R_{7} > 0 such that
We start with the following enumeration of the nodes in Γ_{1} as depicted in Fig. 1.Denote the nodes in Γ_{1} closest to (0, 0), that is, the neighbours of (0, 0), and name them a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4}, with a_{1} being any of the four and the rest named clockwise. Then, choose any of the nodes in Γ_{1} of distance two from a_{4} and distance three from (0, 0), and name it a_{5} and continue clockwise the enumeration with the rest of the nodes in Γ_{1} of distance three from (0, 0). Then do the same for the nodes of Γ_{1} of distance four from (0, 0). We continue in the same way with the nodes in Γ_{1} of higher distances from (0, 0), moving clockwise, while we move away from (0, 0). In this way, the nodes in Γ_{1} are enumerated in a spiral way moving clockwise away from (0, 0). So, we can write E^{Γ1}=⊓i=1+∞E^{ai}.Then, the entropy of the product measure E^{Γ1} can be expressed in terms of the entropies of single nodes in Γ_{1} for which we have shown a log-Sobolev type inequality in Proposition VI.1,
To compute the entropies on the right-hand side, we will use the log-Sobolev type inequality for the one-site measure E^{ak} from Proposition VI.1,
where above we used that ν‖∇_{ak}(Eak−1…Ea1f2){12}‖^{2}≤ν‖∇_{ak}f‖^{2}, since by the way the spiral was constructed its elements do not neighbour with each other. For every j that neighbours with at least one of the a_{k−1}, a_{k−2}, …, a_{1}, we have that
where above the second inequality holds because of (72). For every j that does not neighbour with any of the a_{k−1}, a_{k−2}, …, a_{1}, we directly get
Putting (74) and (75) in (73), we obtain
In the last two sums above, for every j∈Z^{2}, the terms Λ(j) and ν∥∇_{j}f∥^{2} appear one time for every i ∈ Γ_{1} with a coefficient J^{dist(i,j)}. Since for every node j, #{i: dist(i, j) = n} ≤ 4^{n}, if we rearrange the terms in the last inequality, the accompanying coefficient for any of these terms is ∑k=0∞(4J){k}=11−4J, assuming J<14, and so we get
For the sum in the second term, we have
and so the proof is completed for a constant C̃=c_{1}+2R_{7}c_{1}J(1−4J){2}.
VII. SPECTRAL GAP AND PROOF OF MAIN THEOREM
In Propositions VI.1 and VI.2, we showed a log-Sobolev type inequality for the one-site measure E^{i,ω} and then obtained a similar inequality for the product measures E^{Γi,ω},i=0,1. In Lemma IV.3, a spectral gap type inequality was also shown for the one-site measure E^{i,ω} for both cases. In the following proposition, the spectral gap type inequality of Lemma IV.3 will be extended to the product measure E^{Γi,ω},i=0,1. However, this does not happen through the spectral gap type inequality for the one-site measure E^{i,ω} of Lemma IV.3, but through the log-Sobolev type inequality for E^{Γi,ω},i=0,1 obtained in Proposition VI.2 and the sweeping out relations for the same measures from Proposition IV.6.
Proposition VII.1. Assume that the Gibbs measure ν and the local specification satisfy the log-Sobolev type inequality (71) and the sweeping out relations (30). Then, the following spectral gap type inequality holds
for i = 0, 1 and some positive constantR̃.The proof of this proposition follows the general approach of Ref [12] and is presented in Lemma 7.1 of Ref [37].Spectral gap inequalities have been associated with convergence to equilibrium and ergodic properties. In the next proposition, we will use the weaker spectral gap inequality for the product measures E^{Γi,ω},i=0,1, of Proposition VII.1 to show the a.e. convergence of P^{n} to the infinite volume Gibbs measure ν, where P^{n} is defined as follows:
Proposition VII.2. Assume that the measure μ satisfies the log-Sobolev inequality and that the local specification has quadratic interactions V as in (6). Then, for J sufficiently small andPas in (76),P^{n}fconverges ν-a.e. to the Gibbs measure ν.
Proof. We will follow closely the approach developed in Ref [23]. We will compute the variance of the P^{n}f with respect to the product measure E^{Γk} for k = 0 or 1, when n is odd or even, respectively. For this, since ν|P^{n}f−P^{n+1}f|^{2}=ν|P^{n}f−E^{Γk}P^{n}f|^{2}, we will use at first the spectral gap type inequality for the product measures E^{Γi,ω},i=0,1 presented in Proposition VII.1,
where above for the second inequality we applied n − 1 times the first sweeping out inequality of Proposition IV.6. If we choose J sufficiently small such that 4R_{2}≤4JG_{6}1−4J<12 (recall that R_{2}≤JG_{6}1−4J), then from the last inequality and Chebyshev inequality, we can calculate
Thus, {P^{n}f−νP^{n}f}{n∈N} converges ν−almost surely by the Borel-Cantelli lemma. Furthermore, P^{n}f→𝜗(f)ν−a.e. We will first show that θ(f) is a constant, which means that it does not depend on variables on Γ_{0} or Γ_{1}. We first notice that P^{n}(f) is a function on Γ_{0} or Γ_{1} when n is odd or even, respectively. This implies that the limits 𝜗_{o}(f)≔lim_{nodd,n→∞}P^{n}f and 𝜗_{e}(f)≔lim_{neven,n→∞}P^{n}f do not depend on variables on Γ_{0} and Γ_{1}, respectively. However, since the two subsequences {P^{n}f}{neven} and {P^{n}f}{nodd} converge to ϑ(f) ν-a.e., we conclude that ϑ_{o}(f) = ϑ (f) = ϑ_{e}(f), which implies that θ(f) is a constant. This implies that
Since the sequence {P^{n}f}{n∈N} converges ν-almost, the same holds for the sequence {P^{n}f−νP^{n}f}{n∈N}. It remains to show that ϑ(f) = ν(f). At first, we show this for positive bounded functions f. In this case, we have
by the dominated convergence theorem and (77). On the other hand, we also have
where above we used the definition of the Gibbs measure ν. From (78) and (79), we get that ϑ(f) = ν(f) for bounded functions f. The argument can be simply extended to no bounded functions if we approximate any function f by the bounded f_{k}(x) ≔ max{f(x), k}.We can now proceed with the proof of the main theorem.
A. Proof Proposition II.3
The proof of the main result will be based on the iterative method developed by Zegarlinski in Refs [46] and  [47] (see also Refs [35] and  [27] for similar application). We will start with the iterative step. Assume P as in (76). For any n ≥ 1,
where k above is 0 or 1 if n is odd or even, respectively. To show this, observe that for any Λ⊂Z^{2},
The statement (80) for n = 1 can be trivially derived from (81) if we put Λ = Γ_{0} and g = f. Assuming (80) is true for some n ≥ 0, we prove it for n + 1. Apply (81) with Λ = Γ_{k} and P^{n}f in place of g, where k above is 0 or 1 if n is odd or even, respectively,
If we apply E^{Γk} to (80) and use the last equality, we obtain (80) for n + 1.
Using Proposition VII.2, we have P^{n}[f⁡log⁡f]→ν[f⁡log⁡f] and (P^{n}f)log(P^{n}f)→ν[f]log⁡ν[f], ν-a.e. From this and Fatou’s lemma, (80) gives
where we used the fact that ν is a Gibbs measure to obtain the last equality. If we use Proposition VI.2 to bound the first term of the first sum, we have
Similarly, for m ≥ 1, we can use Proposition VI.2 and then we get
where for the last inequalities we used Proposition V.2 and induction. Substituting into (82), we obtain (recall that 0 < C_{2} < 1)
where C¯ is the largest of the two coefficients. This ends the proof of the log-Sobolev inequality for ν.
