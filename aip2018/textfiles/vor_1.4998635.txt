Hofstadter’s butterfly and Langlands duality
We address the Hofstadter problem on a two-dimensional square lattice system. We propose a novel perspective on its mathematical structure of the corresponding tight-binding Hamiltonian from a viewpoint of the Langlands duality, a mathematical conjecture relevant to a wide range of the modern mathematics including number theory, solvable systems, representations, and geometry. It is known that the Hamiltonian can be algebraically written by means of the quantum group U_{q}(sl_{2}). We claim that Hofstadter’s fractal is deeply related with the Langlands duality of the quantum group. In addition, from this perspective, the existence of the corresponding elliptic curve expression interpreted from the tight-binging Hamiltonian implies a more fascinating connection with the Langlands program and quantum geometry.
I. INTRODUCTION
Several profound conjectures on number theory and harmonic analysis proposed by Langlands [1] have been developed drastically in a vast area of modern mathematics, and nowadays it is recognized as the Langlands program. Those series of innovation are also directed to (quantum) integrable systems [2,3] and representation theory of quantum groups [4]. Despite a wide range of subjects dealt with the Langlands program, there are many mathematical proofs of this conjecture and they strongly suggest very nontrivial mathematical phenomena. From the perspectives of physics, the Langlands program first showed up as the electric-magnetic duality, which was later reinterpreted as the S-duality of a supersymmetric Yang-Mils theory.
As an application to a simpler problem setting of the Langlands duality, we address the Hofstadter problem on a two-dimensional square lattice accommodating Bloch electrons in a uniform magnetic field perpendicular to the system. This problem is formulated by means of the tight-binding Hamiltonian (3), and energy spectra show the fractal butterfly (Fig. 1) [5]. From a mathematical viewpoint, the Hamiltonian can be written with the quantum group U_{q}(sl_{2}) [6], and since their seminal discoveries, it has been naively believed that there would be a more number theoretically profound background for the Hofstadter butterfly and the tight-binding Hamiltonian. We claim that it is nothing but the Langlands duality and, in this article, we build a direct connection between Hofstadter’s butterfly and the Langlands duality of U_{q}(sl_{2}). In addition, this view point also sheds light on an elliptic curve obtained by the tight-binding Hamiltonian as a result of mirror symmetry and the Langlands conjecture.
This article is orchestrated as follows. In Sec. II, we begin with explaining our problem setting and review it from a perspective of the Langlands duality of the quantum group. In Subsections II A–II C, we relate the problem to high energy physics and mathematical physics. Finally, this note is concluded in Sec. III.
II. HOFSTADTER’S BUTTERFLY AND LANLANDS DUALITY
A. Preliminary
Throughout this paper, we consider the integer quantum Hall effect on a square lattice in a uniform magnetic flux ϕ = P/Q (in a unit of flux quantum ϕ_{0} = hc/e) per plaquette, where P and Q are the coprime numbers. The energy spectrum of the Hamiltonian (3) shows the novel fractal structure (Fig. 1) as a function of the flux ϕ, called Hofstadter’s butterfly [5]. It is known that it is generated by the maps
where f is some function. However the origin of this fractal nature had been a mystery, and hence how to determine the function f had been a problem. Recently, the map (1) turned out to have intimate relations to the modular transformation of parameters associated with a Calabi-Yau manifold [7,8]. Instead of the tight binding Hamiltonian, they worked on the Hamiltonian H = e^{−x} + e^{x} + R^{2}(p^{−x} + p^{x}) of the relativistic Toda lattice, which is a integrable system, and identified the energy spectrum as the roots of polynomials P_{ϕ}. Moreover they derived the formula
where Ẽ=f(E) and R̃=R^{1/ϕ}, by using its dual Hamiltonian H̃=e^{−x̃}+e^{x̃}+R̃{2}(p^{−x̃}+p^{x̃}) in terms of quantum geometry.
B. Langlands duality of quantum groups
A generic tight binding Hamiltonian we are interested in is
where c_{m,n}(cm,n†) is the annihilation (creation) operator at the (m, n) site. When we choose the Landau gauge Am,nx=0,Am,ny=2πmϕ, the eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian are obtained by solving Harper’s equation
where ψ_{n} are the Bloch functions with period Q (ψ_{n} = ψ_{n+Q}). We consider only the x-direction since the y-direction does not contribute to the equation in the Landau gauge, which is a consequence of Bloch’s theorem. Therefore our problem results in solving the characteristic polynomial associated with an equivalent Hamiltonian which is a Q × Q matrix given by
where we choose a Q-dimensional representation ρ_{Q} of U_{q}(sl_{2}) with q = e^{i2πP/Q} so that
where X and Y are defined by the use of U_{q}(sl_{2}) generators [6]. These operators T_{x} and T_{y} are non-commutative because of the Aharonov-Bohm phase for an electron moving around the flux,
The energy spectrum consists of eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian, which is described by the Chambers relation [9]
where P_{ϕ}(E, R) is a polynomial and h(k, R) = 2(−1)^{Q−1}(cos(Qk_{x}) + R^{2Q} cos(Qk_{y})). The point k_{0} = (π/2Q, π/2Q) where h(k, R) vanishes is called a mid-band point. Therefore the energy spectrum at the mid-band point obeys P_{ϕ}(E, R) = 0. Some examples of P_{ϕ} are as follows:
The above polynomials are exactly the same as in Ref [7]. Hence the anticipated formula P_{P/Q}(E,R)=P_{Q/P}(Ẽ,R̃) (2) implies the equivalence of the Q-dimensional representation (6) of U_{q}(sl_{2}) and the P-dimensional representation of UL{q}(sl_{2}), where ^{L}q = e^{i2π/ϕ} and UL{q}(sl_{2}) is the Langlands dual quantum group of U_{q}(sl_{2}) [4,10]. We write this duality map by
where the dual Hamiltonian H̃ is given by the following P × P matrix of the form:
where T̃{x}=e^{ik̃x}ρ_{P}(X) and T̃{y}=e^{ik̃y}ρ_{P}(Y). Since we expect the correspondence of the characteristic polynomials det(H−E)=det(H̃−Ẽ), we find R̃=R^{1/ϕ} by comparing order of R and R̃ in h(k, R) and h̃(k̃,R̃).
The reason why this duality originates from the Langlands duality of quantum groups is explained by the interpolating quantum group U_{q,t}(sl_{2}) [4], which is parameterized by arbitrary nonzero complex values q, t and generated by X^{±},K^{±1},K̃{±1} such that
The interpolating property of U_{q,t}(sl_{2}) appears as
By definition, U_{q,t}(sl_{2}) is equivalent to the usual quantum group U_{ϱ}(sl_{2}) with generators X^{±},KK̃ and the parameter ϱ = qt. Taking q = e^{i2πP/Q} and t = ^{L}q = e^{i2πQ/P}, we find ϱ = q^{L}q = e^{i2π(P/Q+Q/P)} is symmetric under exchanging P and Q. Therefore the fractal structure in Hofstadter’s butterfly embodies “symmetry breaking” of this quantum group U_{ϱ}(sl_{2}) into a quantum group U_{q}(sl_{2}) and its Langlands dual quantum group UL{q}(sl_{2}). The Langlands duality of quantum groups is formulated by Frenkel and Hernandez [4] and, according to which, any irreducible representation of U_{q}(sl_{2}) would be t-deformed uniquely to a representation of U_{q,t}(sl_{2}) in such a way that its specialization at q = 1 gives a representation of U_{t}(sl_{2}). The easiest case is Q = 1 and P = 2. The one-dimensional representation of U_{q}(sl_{2}) is dual to the two-dimensional representation of U_{t}(sl_{2})(t={L}q=e^{π2iQ/P}), which is equivalent to P_{1/2}(E,R)=P_{2/1}(Ẽ,R̃). Generically, we observe that a Q-dimensional representation of U_{q}(sl_{2}) and a P-dimensional representation of UL{q}(sl_{2}) are dual. The Langlands duality of quantum groups is also studied in Ref [11].
C. Comments on W-algebra and mirror symmetry
Let us mention another viewpoint which connects Hofstadter’s butterfly and the Langlands duality. The quantum affine algebra U_{q}(sl_{2}^) is a natural extension of U_{q}(sl_{2}), and the deformed W-algebra W_{q,t}(sl_{2}) interpolates U_{q}(sl_{2}^) and U_{t}(sl_{2}^) [12–14], where t = q^{β} with a parameter β. More recently the Langlands duality between a conformal block of U_{q}(sl_{2}^) and that of W_{q,t}(sl_{2}) was established in Ref [15]. In the limit of q → 1 with t = q^{β}, we have W_{q,t}(sl_{2})→W_{β}(sl_{2}) [13]. What is called the Langlands duality of W-algebras [16] is
Surprisingly, they are related to the S-duality of four-dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories with parameters β = R_{s}/R_{t} and ^{L}β = R_{t}/R_{s}, where R_{s} and R_{t} are the radii of circles in T^{2}=Ss1×St1 [15]. In our case, these parameters are somehow identified with R_{s} = P and R_{t} = Q. Taking q = e^{i2πβ} and t={L}q=e^{i2πLβ}, we have the following duality picture:
These relations with supper Yang-Mills theories are quite interesting since it implies some relations with the geometric Langlands duality in an unexpected way. It desires further endeavor to clarify all of those relations.
We leave comments on the relation to S-duality of four-dimensional N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories. In physics, the geometric Langlands correspondence was first mentioned for mirror symmetries of Hitchin moduli spaces M_{G} and W_{LG} as results of dimensional reduction to a two-dimensional sigma model [17]. These Hitchin moduli spaces are exchanged by S-transformation of the form
where ^{L}G is the Langlands dual Lie group of G. Goddard, Nuyts, and Olive (GNO) who found the Langlands dual groups from physical motivation [18].^{L}G is known as a GNO dual group among physicists. τ is a parameter of the theory, and n_{g} is the ratio of length squared of long and short roots of G. What is different in our case is the S̃-transformation (10) plays an alternative role. Hence we interpret that S̃-duality endows another mathematical phenomenon, which we may call a “quantum Langlands correspondence.”
It is interesting to investigate more physically realistic meanings and reasons of the Langlands program in order to unveil its philosophy. Indeed, in both condensed matter physics and high energy physics, there are many topics which are believed to be somehow connected with. We expect that the Langlands philosophy gives one possible strategy to enhance our understandings on those cross-cutting issues. When we believe in the relation of the Langlands duality and mirror symmetry, as suggested in some studies, we can find more attractive phenomena as described below. Now we consider the mirror symmetry of Calabi-Yau manifolds. It is known that a Calabi-Yau manifold can be obtained by the fibration of the anti-canonical bundle
over a Fano variety M, where −K_{M} = −c_{1}(TM). We pay attention to the Fano variety which can be constructed by means of the polyhedron in Fig. 2.
In our case, the Harper equation (4) corresponds to the difference equation
for the local P^{1}×P^{1} model in the diagonal slice, where ℏ = 2πP/Q (P, Q are positive integers). And the mirror curve
corresponds to the tight-binding Hamiltonian (5) of Hofstadter’s problem. Furthermore, what is fascinating for us is the following observation. It is known that the elliptic curve of the form
is given by our mirror curve (19) by Nagell’s algorithm (see Ref [19] for instance). We consider this elliptic curve over Q. Then the Frobenius eigenvalues are defined as b_{p} = p + 1 − #E(p), where #E(p) is the number of points of E modulo p. According to the original Langlands correspondence in number theory there exists an automorphic form
with a_{1} = 1 and b_{p} = a_{p} for all but finitely many primes p. (a_{p} is an eigenvalue of the corresponding Hecke operator.) In this way, the Langlands conjecture [1] has been formulated and partly solved. The categorical equivalence
is a standard statement of the homological mirror symmetry of the enhanced triangulated category over any toric Fano variety M and the derived Fukaya-Seidel category over a Laurent polynomial W. To show this equivalence in a general manner is an open question. Fortunately a mathematical proof is established in our case M=P^{1}×P^{1} [20]. Roughly speaking, the A-models living on D^{b}F(W) are obtained at the limit ℏ → ∞, and the B-models on D^{b} coh(M) are obtained at the classical limit ℏ → 0. So the mirror symmetry is understood as the strong-weak duality or electric-magnetic duality in physics sense.
III. CONCLUSION
In this note, we showed a novel relation between the Hofstadter problem and the Langlands duality. As far as the author knows, to show the correspondence of the mirror symmetry conjectures proposed in topological strings and those in the generic string theory is still an open question as well as their relations to the Langlands program. However, as we discussed so far, they would be also deeply relevant again from a perspective of the Langlands duality. Therefore it is worth investigating how they are consistent with each other more specifically. Regarding condensed matter physics, Hofstadter’s problem has been widely studied in various materials and dimensions. Many of them show the similar butterfly structures, and more recently topological string aspects of them in an exotic setting for condensed matter physics was obtained as well [21]. Though specific background of the fractal nature has not yet uncovered, it is indeed a fascinating scope for the mathematical physics. In addition, Hofstadter’s problem is relevant with the quantum Hall effects and described from a perspective of the geometric Langlands correspondence in Ref [22].
