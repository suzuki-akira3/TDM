Investigation of thermal and optical properties on polysilicon by the photothermal deflection technique
In this paper, a method is described to study the geometry and thermal properties of grain boundaries in a polysilicon sample. This method is based on the Photothermal Deflection Technique called “Photothermal Imaging.” In order to be able to heat the sample by a very low laser beam power (2 mW), the sample is immersed in a cell filled with paraffin oil. The comparison of the experimental curves of amplitude and phase of the photothermal signal variations versus the displacement x of the sample to the corresponding theoretical ones allows obtaining thermal properties of the grain boundaries and their dimension.
I. INTRODUCTION
Photothermal methods, which are non-destructive methods, are based on the detection of thermal waves generated by the sample's absorption of a modulated light flux. Several techniques called photothermal imaging have been developed to study the inhomogeneities in materials [1,2]. The first studies done on photothermal imaging characterization of materials are those of Thomas et_al [3], who have developed a device of photothermal microscopy. This work aimed to study the change in thermal properties on the surface and in the volume of the ceramic materials in the vicinity of some areas prone to Vickers hardness tests; photothermal images obtained reveal clearly the presence of cracks and also impaired on the microcrystalline structure of the material. This technique has been successfully used to detect changes caused by the machining process materials.
Photothermal thermography [4] was used to control fragile materials such as detachment of murals layers or detecting defects in plaster blocks. In this study, the sample is heated by a continuous flow of light or the flash technique.
Also the Photopyroelectric technique [5] was used to obtain images of a sample to detect subsurface defects on certain metals. Then image processing can be traced back for determining the size and depth of the defect.
Astrath et_al [6,7] has introduced a three-dimensional time resolved model for calculating photothermal deflection. They solved the heat conduction equations for two semi-infinite media, an opaque sample and a fluid, for a Gaussian heat source, and the transient deflection signal was calculated. This model was used to investigate the thermal properties of opaque plastic and metals. The obtained results are in good agreement with those in the literature [8–12].
An experimental photothermal imaging set-up based on the “Mirage Effect” technique was mounted in our laboratory. Let us remember that the “Mirage Effect” which was discovered in 1980 by Boccara et_al [13], is based on the detection of thermal waves propagating in a fluid whose refractive index gradient will cause the deflection of a probe laser beam. This technique was successfully used to determine the optical absorption spectrum, the thermal conductivity, and the thermal diffusivity of bulk semiconductors samples [14] and also thin semiconductors layers [15,16]. In a previous work we have used this technique to detect surface and subsurface defects in materials [17,18].
The originality of this work consists in heating the sample by a very low power laser of 2 mW instead of a laser with a power greater than 1 W. So to obtain a signal that we can detect, the sample is immersed in a cell filled with paraffin oil in order to amplify the amplitude of the photothermal signal. Indeed, the variation of the refractive index with the temperature (dn/dT) is about 1000 times greater for the liquid than gas or air [19]. This method allows us to avoid the phenomena that are related to using a powerful laser which must be taken into account in our theoretical model such as the “Drum Effect.” [20]
First the thermal properties of grain boundaries in a polysilicon sample (Fig. 1) were studied using the photothermal deflection technique, in order to validate our theoretical model in determining the geometry of these grain boundaries as well as their thermal properties. Second, we have studied the same sample using the photothermal deflection spectroscopy technique in order to determine its optical absorption spectrum and then gap energy.
II. THEORY
The principle of the photothermal deflection technique or “Mirage Effect” consists in heating the sample placed in a gas or in a liquid with a modulated light; the optical absorption of the sample will generate a temperature gradient therefore a refractive index gradient in the fluid in contact with the sample’s surface which will cause the deflection of a laser probe beam skimming the sample surface.
This deflection Ψ [21] is a function of thermal and optical properties of the sample and also of the thermal properties of fluid and backing
where, T_{f} is the distribution temperature elevation in the fluid and n its refractive index.
This temperature, in the case of uniform heating, can be written as
where T_{0} is the periodic temperature elevation at the sample surface and σ_{f}=(1+j)πFD_{f}=1+jμ_{f}. F and D_{f} are respectively the modulation frequency and thermal diffusivity of the fluid. ω=2πF, and z_{0} is the distance between the sample surface and the probe laser beam axis.
To determine the expression of the temperature T_{0} at the sample surface, we have to resolve the heat equations in each medium of the structure (Fig. 2).
The heat equations in each medium are written as follows:
After resolving these equations in each media, one can obtain the expression of the surface temperature T_{0} which is written as [22]
where b, g, and r are the constants functions of the thermal and optical properties of different media.
K_{i}, D_{i} are, respectively, thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity of the i medium and α is the optical absorption coefficient of the sample, and A=αI_{0}/2k_{s}.
Knowing the expression of T_{0}, one can determine the expression of the deflection Ψ. T_{0} which is a complex number could be written as T_{0}=|T_{0}|e^{jθ}. So
ψ(z_{0},t) Which also a complex number could be written as
where |ψ| and ϕ are, respectively, the amplitude and phase of the deflection ψ.
As shown in Fig. 3(a) the scanned region is composed of three areas. Area 1 and 3 are the monocrystalline silicon however the area 2 is the grain boundary. When we move the sample in the x direction, z_{0} and F are constant so both amplitude and phase remain constant as long as we are in the same area (constant thermal properties). When we move from an area to another the thermal properties vary so both amplitude and phase changes.
After obtaining the expression of the deflection of a laser probe beam, one can draw, using the program maple 17, the variations of the amplitude and phase of Ψ versus the displacement x of the sample [Fig. 3(b)] by scanning the different areas.
The curves of Figs. 4(a)–4(c) represent the theoretical variations of normalized amplitude and phase of the photothermal signal versus the displacement of the sample x respectively for different values of thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity, and modulation frequency.
We note on Figs. 4(a) and 4(b) that both normalized amplitude and phase presents two saturated areas when the pump beam is located in areas 1 and 3. However when the pump beam is between the area 1–2 and 2–3 both amplitude and phase vary. This variation is due to the difference of thermal properties between the two areas. We note also that the amplitude is sensitive to both thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity however the phase is only sensitive to the thermal diffusivity. So the phase difference ΔΦ allows us to determine the thermal diffusivity value of the grain boundary.
We note in Fig. 4(c) that both normalized amplitude and phase increase with the modulation frequency.
III. EXPERIMENTAL SET UP
A. Photothermal imaging set up
The experimental set-up (Fig. 5) is described in Ref [18]. In our case, the heating beam is a laser beam (Helium–Neon) of power 2 mW whose diameter size on the sample surface is estimated to be 50 μm. In order to amplify the amplitude of the signal, the sample is immersed in a cell filled with paraffin oil.
When we study the photothermal signal versus the displacement x of the sample, the modulation frequency remains constant. The light is modulated using a mechanical chopper (SR540). The laser probe beam (He–Ne) skimming the sample surface will be deflected. The sample is fixed on X–Y table (two stepper motors Newport Miniature linear stages MFA) commanded by a Universal Motion Controller/Driver ESP300 which gives the possibility of displacement horizontally and vertically. A Labview program makes automatic measurements of the photothermal signal. The system works in such a way that it measures the signal at one point, and then moves to the next. The deflection of the probe beam is measured thanks to a silicon photodetector of four quadrants (QD50T) linked to a lock-in amplifier (EG&G model5209) giving the amplitude and the phase of the photothermal signal. A personal computer was used to store the amplitude and the phase of the signal and draw their variations with the displacement.
B. Spectroscopy set-up
The photothermal deflection spectroscopy mounting aims to study the variations of the photothermal signal as a function of wavelength. The experimental set-up is practically the same that of Fig. 5 except that a monochromator was interposed between the lamp and the chopper. The sample immersed in a cell filled with paraffin oil, is heated by a monochromatic light [23].
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Photothermal imaging technique
The sample which is a polycrystalline silicon presents grain boundaries. It was moved in the x direction on a range of 0.2 mm with a step of 3 μm (note that the laser pump and probe beams are fixed) and we plot the variations of the amplitude and phase of the signal according to the displacement x at a fixed modulation frequency of 64 Hz, as indicated in Fig. 6.
The obtained experimental curves present two saturation areas as has been already shown in the theoretical study. The amplitude and phase of the signal vary because the thermal properties of the grain boundary are different from those of the single crystal. The coincidence between these curves with the theoretical ones, allows to accurately determining the thermal diffusivity and the thermal conductivity of the grain boundary.
It has already been demonstrated in the theoretical study that the phase is only sensitive to thermal diffusivity, so the best coincidence between the experimental and theoretical curves of the phase allow determining the thermal diffusivity of the grain size equal to 2.55 × 10^{−5} m^{2} s^{−1}. In Fig. 7(a) are reported the experimental and theoretical phase curves for three different values of thermal diffusivity. One can observe the great sensitivity of the phase to the thermal diffusivity.
As the amplitude is sensitive to both thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity, knowing the value of the thermal diffusivity one can determine the thermal conductivity. In Fig. 7(b) are plotted the experimental curves of the amplitude and phase of the signal obtained with the theoretical ones for different values of thermal conductivity at a thermal diffusivity value equal to 2.55 × 10^{−5} m^{2} s^{−1}. So the best coincidence between theory and experiment is obtained for a thermal conductivity value equal to 37.2 W m^{−1} K^{−1}.
Using these values, one can draw the variations of the photothermal signal according to the displacement x for different values of modulation frequency. A good agreement between theory and experience is observed (Fig. 8). On the other hand, the coincidence between theory and experience allows to determine the size of grain boundary in the direction of the probe beam path evaluated to be 75 μm as shown in Fig. 8.
B. Spectroscopy
On the same sample, we have conducted a spectroscopic study; in Fig. 9 are reported the experimental normalized amplitude variation with wave length. We note that both amplitude and phase present two saturated areas corresponding respectively to a high and a very low absorption coefficient. In order to deduce the optical absorption spectrum of polysilicon, we have to compare the experimental curves to the corresponding theoretical ones as shown in Fig. 9.
In Fig. 10 is reported the optical absorption spectrum of the polysilicon sample.
Gap energy is obtained from the optical absorption spectrum using the Tauc law for energies above the gap: 
where β is a constant, E_{g} is the gap energy, E = hυ is the photon energy, n = 2 for semiconductors having a direct gap, and n = 1/2 for those having an indirect gap.
The variations of (αE)^{n} according the energy E are shown in Fig. 10. The extrapolation of the linear part of the curve intersects the axis of the energy (α = 0) by a value corresponding to the gap energy 1.1 eV.
The value of the gap obtained is identical to that found in the literature [24].
V. CONCLUSION
In this work, we used the technique “Mirage Effect” to determine the dimensions and thermal properties of a grain boundary in a polycrystalline silicon sample. The originality of this work lies in immersing the sample in a cell filled with paraffin oil in order to amplify the signal by a factor of 1000 and not be forced to use a powerful laser; in fact we used a 2 mW power laser focused on the sample surface and having a diameter of 50 μm. By searching the adequate coincidence between the experimental and theoretical curves of the amplitude and phase of the photothermal signal we have determined, with high accuracy, the size of the grain boundary which is of the order of 75 μm and its thermal properties. Furthermore spectroscopic study allows us to obtain the absorption spectrum of the polycrystalline silicon and consequently its energy gap.
