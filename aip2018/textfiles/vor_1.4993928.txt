Development of ball surface acoustic wave trace moisture analyzer using burst waveform undersampling circuit
The measurement and control of trace moisture, where the water concentration is lower than 1 ppmv [−76.2 °C for the frost point (°CFP)], are essential for improving the yield rate of semiconductor devices and for ensuring their reliability. A ball surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensor with a sol-gel silica coating exhibited useful characteristics for a trace moisture analyzer (TMA) when the temperature drift of the delay time output was precisely compensated using two-frequency measurement (TFM), where the temperature-compensated relative delay time change (RDTC) was obtained by subtracting the RDTC at the fundamental frequency from that at the third harmonic frequency on an identical propagation path. However, the cost of the measurement circuit was a problem. In this study, a burst waveform undersampling (BUS) circuit based on the theory of undersampling measurement was developed as a practical means. The BUS circuit was useful for precise temperature compensation of the RDTC, and the ball SAW TMA was prototyped by calibrating the RDTC using a TMA based on cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS), which is the most reliable method for trace moisture measurement. The ball SAW TMA outputted a similar concentration to that obtained by the CRDS TMA, and its response time at a set concentration in N_{2} with a flow rate of 1 l/min was about half that of the CRDS TMA, suggesting that moisture of −80 °CFP was measured within only 1 min. The detection limit at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 was estimated to be 0.05 ppbv, comparable with that of the CRDS TMA. From these results, it was demonstrated that a practical ball SAW TMA can be realized using the developed BUS circuit.
I. INTRODUCTION
Trace moisture is defined as a water concentration of less than 1 ppmv [−76.2 °C for the frost point (°CFP)] in a gas [1]. The measurement and control of trace moisture are essential for improving the yield rate of semiconductor devices and for ensuring their reliability [2]. Currently, the trace moisture analyzer (TMA) quantitatively applicable to this concentration regime is based on cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) [3,4], which can measure a water concentration of 1 ppbv at an industrially practical flow rate such as 1 l/min. However, it is difficult for a CRDS TMA to be installed in each production line since the precise optical cavity of the detector with an optical path longer than 10 km realized by a length of 500 mm cannot easily be further miniaturized from the current design and it is too expensive to mass-produce.
An acoustic wave sensor is a potential process-monitoring TMA because of its relatively low cost and small size [2,5]. TMAs based on a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) with a hydrophilic polymer coating have been commercialized, but the response time is twice that of a CRDS TMA [6]. This could be caused by the long equilibrium time of the relatively thick sensitive film that is required to compensate for the low mass-loading sensitivity. A surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensor, where a sensitive film is fabricated on a SAW device, has theoretically superior sensitivity to a QCM owing to the surface confinement of acoustic energy [7]. Although a SAW sensor with a metal-organic-framework coating was developed for trace moisture measurement and the detection of 280 ppbv moisture was demonstrated [8], the sensitivity was insufficient for measuring concentrations of less than 235 ppbv (−85 °CFP).
With this background, our group developed a ball SAW sensor [9], in which the sensitivity was enhanced by the multiple-roundtrip propagation of a SAW, and it demonstrated hydrogen sensors and volatile organic compound sensors with detection limits of ppmv order [10–18]. In trace moisture measurement, we found that some quartz ball SAW sensors detected trace moisture, the source of which was found to be a damaged layer of amorphous silica [19,20]. A sol-gel silica film was applied to a ball SAW sensor using an industrially compatible method to reproduce a sensitive layer [21]. An outstanding response to trace moisture was observed in the delay time output when the temperature drift of the output was precisely compensated by two-frequency measurement (TFM) [22,23], where the temperature-compensated relative delay time change (RDTC) was obtained by subtracting the RDTC at the fundamental frequency from that at the third harmonic frequency on an identical propagation path. As a result, it was found that temperature-compensated RDTC might be proportional to square root of the concentration in trace moisture level. It is advantageous characteristic to the measurement of very low concentration. The detection limit of 0.2 ppbv at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 and the response time of 65 s to a concentration change in N_{2} at a set concentration of 790 ppbv (−77.8 °CFP) were comparable with and ten times faster than those of a CRDS TMA at a flow rate of 0.1 l/min [22].
Although the TMA using the ball SAW sensor (ball SAW TMA) was a promising technology, there was an issue with the cost of the measurement system. The TFM was performed using the fundamental and third harmonic frequencies generated with the harmonic ball SAW sensor of typically 80 and 240 MHz, respectively. An analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with performance comparable with a high-performance digital oscilloscope was required for baseband sampling of the third harmonic frequency [21–24], but this made the circuit expensive. On the other hand, an inexpensive ADC with a low sampling frequency such as 10 MHz can be used if the received signal is precisely downconverted using a heterodyne circuit. Although a digital quadrature detector based on a heterodyne circuit was developed, it required two precise synthesizers to measure a single frequency. Therefore, four synthesizers were required for TFM [16,25], also making the circuit expensive.
To solve this problem, we theoretically investigated the feasibility of undersampling (US) measurement [26,27], where the sampling frequency of the ADC was lower than double the frequency of the received waveform. A simulation using experimental data revealed that the temperature-compensated delay time output by US may be similar to that in the baseband sampling if the excitation signal is perfectly synchronized with the sampling clock of the ADCs and the US is executed after the received waveform is processed by narrow band-pass filters (BPFs) [28].
In this study, we aim to develop a burst waveform undersampling (BUS) circuit as a practical means of TFM using a ball SAW sensor and show its applicability to a ball SAW TMA. In Sec. II, the principle of TFM is briefly summarized and the theory of the magnification of the delay time output in US is presented. In Sec. III, a block diagram of the BUS circuit used to implement the theory is shown and the BUS circuit is described. In Sec. IV, the experimental instrumentation for our prototype BUS circuit, the ball SAW TMA, and the measurement conditions of trace moisture for evaluation of the developed TMA are described. In Sec. V, the results are presented for BUS waveforms and delay time responses at US frequencies determined by wavelet analysis. It is demonstrated that the BUS circuit realizes RDTC measurement applicable to TFM. The prototype ball SAW TMA is calibrated using previously measured data, and its response time is compared with that of a CRDS TMA. In Sec. VI, we discuss the lower detection limit and response time. Finally, conclusions are presented in Sec. VII.
II. PRINCIPLE OF TFM BY US
A. Two-frequency measurement
The RDTC is defined by
where T is the delay time, T_{0} is the standard delay time common to that in calibration measurement, and ΔT is the difference between T_{0} and T [22–24]. In addition, T_{0} and ΔT are expressed as
where n is the number of turns of a roundtrip waveform, L is the circumference of the ball, v_{0} is the standard phase velocity, and Δv is the change in the phase velocity from v_{0}. The RDTC of a SAW sensor caused by changes in the mass loading and elastic loading is expressed as
where f is the frequency; ΔΘ, Δm, and ΔG are the changes in the temperature, mass, and rigidity, respectively; and A, B_{m}, and B_{G} are the coefficients of their changes, respectively. RDTC due to property changes of sensitive film is proportionally increased by frequency, but that due to the temperature change is independent of the frequency. When RDTCs at frequencies of f_{1} and f_{2} are expressed as Δt_{1} and Δt_{2}, respectively, the difference between them gives the temperature-compensated RDTC, expressed as
B. Magnification of delay time change by US
A roundtrip waveform is expressed as
where V_{0} is the amplitude, t is the time, and g(t) is the envelope of the burst waveform. Generally, the sampling operation is approximated by mixing the original waveform with the rectangular waveform of a sampling clock. Since the rectangular waveform is composed of cosine waveforms of the fundamental frequency f_{s} and its harmonic frequencies, each frequency component is expressed as cos2πNf_{s}t, where N is an integer denoting the order of the harmonic. Therefore, a US waveform includes cosine waveforms with frequencies of f + Nf_{s} and f − Nf_{s}. If only the low-frequency component is observed owing to the cutoff frequency of the circuit, the measurable US waveform is expressed as
Here, the coefficient of ΔT in Eq. (6) is compared with that in Eq. (7), and it is found that the change in the phase equivalent to the delay time of V_{US} is magnified by a factor of
Therefore, the delay time change measured during the baseband sampling of the original waveform is demodulated from that measured using US and scaled by a factor of C. On the other hand, the group delay, observed as the roundtrip time, is expressed as
and is not magnified by US.
Harmonic ball SAW sensor can generate a waveform including odd-order harmonic frequencies. The use of the third harmonic frequency is practical due to the amplitude much higher than that of the other harmonic frequencies. In the case of f_{s} = 100 MHz, if US frequencies of f_{u1} and f_{u2} are determined so as to satisfy the sampling theorem, N becomes 1 and 2 for f_{1} = 80 MHz and f_{2} = 3f_{1}, respectively. As a result, the magnification factors are calculated as
where negative frequency of f_{u1} means that the polarity of the phase change, or the delay time change, of US waveform is inverted. The temperature-compensated delay time change is calculated using C_{1} and C_{2} as
where Δt_{u1} and Δt_{u2} are the RDTCs at US frequencies of f_{u1} and f_{u2}, respectively.
III. STRUCTURE OF BUS CIRCUIT
A block diagram of the proposed BUS circuit is shown in Fig. 1. A continuous rectangular-waveform signal of f_{0} = 2.4 GHz is generated using a synthesizer (Syn) with the reference signal of a temperature-compensated crystal oscillator (TCXO) of 10 MHz. It is synchronously downconverted using frequency dividers FDIV1, 2, and 3 with factors of 1/24, 1/10, and 1/30 to f_{1} = 80 MHz, f_{2} = 240 MHz, and f_{s} = 100 MHz, respectively. The continuous rectangular-waveform signals of frequencies f_{1} and f_{2} are processed by low-pass filters (LPFs) capable of passing frequencies f_{1} and f_{2}, respectively, to reduce harmonic distortion. They are added and processed to obtain the burst waveform signal gated by the rectangular pulse of a timing controller (TC) with an rf switch (SW). The transmission signal (Tx) is generated using a broadband amplifier (Amp1) and transmitted to the ball SAW sensor through a directional coupler (DC).
The reflection signal (Rx) is amplified using another broadband amplifier (Amp2) and filtered by narrow BPFs with center frequencies of f_{1} and f_{2}. We used analog filters with quality factors of 20 and 40 for BPF1 and BPF2, respectively. The filtered signals are sampled by ADCs with a sampling rate of f_{s} (ADC1 and ADC2). Distorted aliasing waveforms are processed by narrow BPFs. We applied wavelet transforms at f_{u1} = 20 MHz and f_{u2} = 40 MHz for BPF3 and BPF4, respectively [28]. The Gabor function was used as a mother wavelet [29]. The quality factor at −6 dB amplitude is expressed by
where γ is the standard deviation of the envelope of the Gabor function. Since we used γ = 50, Q was 21 for both BPF3 and BPF4.
The delay time at each frequency is determined by the zero-crossing time with negative slope closest to the maximum magnitude of the wavelet transform to minimize the influence of noise, which is calculated by a bisection method with a precision of 10 fs [28,30]. To remove the drift due to the temperature fluctuation of the analog-circuit characteristics, the delay time is determined by the difference between the delay time at the seventh turn (n = 7) and that at the third turn (n = 3) [22,28].
IV. EXPERIMENT
A. BUS circuit
The BUS circuit is shown in Fig. 2. It is controlled by a computer using RS-232C protocol as shown in Fig. 2(a). Four BUS waveforms averaged over 10 000 times were acquired with intervals of 14.2 s, where the resolution and record length of each waveform were 16 bit and 300 points, respectively. Figure 2(b) shows a photograph of the inner structure. The circuit shown in Fig. 1 was assembled using commercial module-circuit blocks and rf cables.
B. Ball SAW TMA
The ball SAW TMA is shown in Fig. 3. It was designed to monitor bulk gases such as N_{2} with a flow rate of more than 1 l/min, typically used in the production lines of semiconductor devices. The pipe system was fabricated using SUS316L stainless-steel tubes of 1/4 in. outer diameter, with the inner surface subjected to electrochemical buffing (ECB), VCR connectors, and stop valves for ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) systems. The ball SAW sensor was installed in a UHV cell made of SUS316L stainless steel subjected to ECB treatment [22] and set on the stage of a thermoelectric heater and cooler. The measurement temperature was set to 24.0 °C. Stop valves V1 and V2 were, respectively, installed upstream and downstream of the UHV cell to protect its interior from contamination during transportation, and stop valve V3 was equipped on a bypass pipe to purge the pipe system before the measurement. In addition, an absolute pressure gauge was installed for future compensation for the pressure in the amplitude output. The amplitude output will be useful for measurement at high moisture concentrations [21]; the results of which will be reported elsewhere.
C. Trace moisture measurement
A quartz harmonic ball SAW device with a fundamental frequency of 80 MHz was coated with SiOx solution synthesized by a sol-gel reaction and used as a trace moisture sensor [21,22]. The ball SAW TMA was connected to a trace moisture generator (TMG) based on a diffusion tube method capable of providing a N_{2} flow of 1 l/min with a moisture concentration up to 1000 ppbv [1], and a CRDS TMA (Tiger Optics, HALO 3 H_{2}O) was connected downstream of the ball SAW TMA to measure the concentration using SUS316L stainless-steel tubes of 1/4 in. outer diameter and 300 mm length, with the inner surface subjected to ECB. The gas pressure at the ball SAW TMA was regulated to 130 kPa by the built-in pressure regulator of the CRDS TMA.
V. RESULTS
A. BUS waveforms
BUS waveforms at the initial point in Fig. 7 are shown as examples. The BUS waveform of the fundamental-frequency signal is shown in Fig. 4, where f_{1} = 80 MHz was converted to f_{u1} = 20 MHz. Figure 4(a) shows the waveform of the seventh turn (n = 7) in a dry N_{2} flow (2.4 ppbv) measured at position A_{1} in Fig. 1. The waveform was distorted by aliasing. Figure 4(b) shows the amplitude spectrum, where vertical dot-dashed lines represent US frequencies and the dashed curve represents the effect of BPF3. The amplitude at f_{u1} is 57 dB larger than that at f_{u2}. The f_{u2} component was caused by imperfect suppression of f_{2} component using the analog BPF filter (BPF1). Similar to Fig. 4, the BUS waveform of the third-harmonic-frequency signal of the seventh turn (n = 7) is shown in Fig. 5, where f_{2} = 240 MHz was converted to f_{u2} = 40 MHz. The distortion of the waveform is more severe than that of the fundamental-frequency signal [Fig. 5(a)]. The amplitude at f_{u2} is 33 dB larger than that at f_{u1}, although the f_{u1} component was observed by the same reason about the f_{1} component with BPF2. Therefore, since f_{u1} and f_{u2} were the dominant frequencies for Figs. 4 and 5, respectively, RDTCs obtained from Figs. 4(a) and 5(a) were attributable to Δt_{u1} and Δt_{u2}, respectively. An application of the wavelet transform is demonstrated in Fig. 6. Figure 6(a) shows a magnified plot of Fig. 5(a). The solid and dashed curves shown in Fig. 6(b) represent the real part and the magnitude of the wavelet transform interpolated by a factor of 1000, respectively. Dot-dashed lines represent the zero-crossing time of the seventh turn (n = 7) at f_{u2}. Similar zero-crossing time was determined from the third turn (n = 3) waveform at f_{u2} (not shown here). The difference between them determines the delay time (T) at f_{u2}. ΔT was the time variation of T from the standard delay time T_{0}. Although Fig. 6(b) calculated all waveform data (ten thousands of points), only the zero-crossing time was calculated in the measurement of the delay time response.
B. Temperature compensation
The delay time outputs measured using the BUS circuit are shown in Fig. 7, where a simple moving average is not applied. T_{0}s at f_{u1} and f_{u2} were obtained from the BUS waveforms at the initial point, which were 12.946 44 μs and 12.935 65 μs, respectively. The set values of the TMG are represented above the upper axis. Each concentration was changed at the times shown by vertical dashed lines. Figures 7(a) and 7(b) show the RDTCs of Δt_{1} and Δt_{2} representing those at f_{1} and f_{2}, which are converted from Δt_{u1} and Δt_{u2} at f_{u1} and f_{u2} using Eqs. (10) and (11), respectively. Figure 7(c) shows the temperature-compensated RDTC Δt_{TC} obtained using Eq. (12). Although drift of the output independent of the set values appeared in Δt_{1} and Δt_{2} between 5 and 7 h, it was effectively removed in Δt_{TC} and the response caused by the concentration change was clearly extracted. Therefore, it was demonstrated that the BUS circuit is useful for practical temperature compensation.
C. Concentration measurement
We calibrate the concentration output of the ball SAW TMA based on the outputs two days earlier measured with the ball SAW TMA and CRDS TMA (Fig. 8). The reference data were sampled by averaging the output over the last 5 min at each set concentration shown by crosses. Figure 9 shows the calibration curve, where open circles represent the reference data and the solid curve represents the result of cubic spline interpolation [31].
The calibrated concentration output of the ball SAW TMA is shown in Fig. 10 along with the concentration measured by the CRDS TMA. Since the measurement interval of the ball SAW TMA (14.2 s) was shorter than that of the CRDS TMA (60 s), a simple moving average was applied to make the time constant of each plot equivalent to 1% of the displayed span, where the averaging factors were 13 points for the ball SAW TMA [Fig. 10(a)] and three points for the CRDS TMA [Fig. 10(b)]. The concentration output of the ball SAW TMA was comparable with that of the CRDS TMA. In addition, the beginning of the response to the concentration change at a set concentration of 18 ppbv was after more than 30 min in the case of the CRDS TMA, later than that for the ball SAW TMA. This was caused by the adsorption of moisture on the inner wall of the SUS316L stainless-steel pipe connecting the ball SAW TMA and the CRDS TMA since the significantly dry stainless-steel pipe acted as a getter of moisture [32].
D. Response time
Figure 11 shows the responses to the concentration change at a set concentration of 680 ppbv shown in Fig. 10. Although the beginning of the response of the CRDS TMA appeared to be earlier than that of the ball SAW TMA, this was an artifact caused by a lack of intermediate data due to the much longer measurement interval. The increase in the output for the ball SAW TMA was much quicker than that for the CRDS TMA. The response times from the 10% level to the 90% level were 0.5 and 1.8 min for the ball SAW TMA and CRDS TMA, respectively.
Now, we discuss a possible cause of the longer response time of the CRDS TMA when the ball SAW TMA was installed upstream. As a fact, the installation of the ball SAW sensor with the UHV cell without stop valve upstream did not change the response time of the CRDS TMA [22]. In this work, the line velocity of N_{2} flow was 1.12 m/s in the pipe system of 1/4 in. outer diameter common to both TMAs and connection pipes. It means that the gas flow through the ball SAW sensor arrives at the CRDS TMA after a few seconds. At 0.5 min from the beginning of the response of CRDS TMA, since the transient response of the ball SAW TMA had been finished, the response of CRDS TMA was not affected by upstream components such as the pipe system, the stop valve V1, and the sensor cell in the ball SAW TMA. After that, the influence of the stop valve V2 was supposed to be vanished within 0.5 min because the specifications of the stop valves V1 and V2 are the same. Therefore, it was judged that the response time of CRDS TMA was longer than that of the ball SAW TMA. Moreover, the dead volume of the ball SAW sensor cell was 0.3 ml but that of an optical cavity of CRDS was estimated to be decades of ml [22]. From these reasons, the increase in the response time of the CRDS TMA was mainly caused by the optical cavity.
VI. DISCUSSION
A. Detection limit
To evaluate the lower detection limit, the relationship between the concentration and the temperature-compensated RDTC is obtained from the results in Fig. 7(c), and it is logarithmically plotted in Fig. 12. Circles represent measured values similar to the reference data in Fig. 8, and the solid line represents the least-squares fitting of a power function. The horizontal dashed line represents three times the value of the root mean square (rms) noise. Since the rms noise was evaluated to be 0.015 ppm using the data from 0 to 1 h in Fig. 7(c), the detection limit at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 was 0.051 ppbv [33]. Therefore, it was found that the ball SAW sensor with the BUS circuit had a detection limit comparable with that of the CRDS TMA. In addition, the approximate square root concentration dependence of the temperature-compensated RDTC was in agreement with previous results for ball SAW trace moisture sensors [19,22].
B. Response time
To systematically compare the response times of the ball SAW TMA and CRDS TMA, the relationship between the set concentration and the response time is logarithmically plotted in Fig. 13. Vertical dashed lines represent the concentrations equivalent to the frost points shown on the upper axis. Closed and open circles represent the values measured by the CRDS TMA and ball SAW TMA, respectively. Solid lines represent inversely proportional relationships. It was found that the response time tended to be inversely proportional to the concentration for both the methods. As a result, the response time of the ball SAW TMA was estimated to be 0.55 times that of the CRDS TMA. The results suggest that the ball SAW TMA can measure moisture levels of −80 °CFP within 1 min and −90 °CFP within 5 min.
In a previous study where the concentration change at a set concentration of 790 ppbv was measured at a flow rate of 0.1 l/min, the response time of the ball SAW sensor (65 s) was about one-tenth that of the CRDS TMA (680 s) [22]. In this study, the response time of the ball SAW TMA at a set concentration of 790 ppbv is estimated to be 27 s from the extrapolation of the measured data in Fig. 12 and that of the CRDS TMA was about 100 s, which is estimated from the measured value at 690 ppbv. Although the response time of the CRDS TMA was reduced sixfold by increasing the flow rate tenfold, that of the ball SAW sensor was reduced by about half. The smaller reduction in the response time for the ball SAW TMA was probably caused by larger dead volume due to the installation of stop valve V1 and the zigzag pipe made of welded elbows. It is expected that the response time can be further reduced by improving the design of the pipe system.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
A BUS circuit based on US theory was developed as a practical means of implementing TFM in a ball SAW sensor. It was verified that the BUS circuit is useful for precise temperature compensation of the delay time change. A ball SAW TMA was prototyped using the BUS circuit with a ball SAW sensor having a sol-gel silica coating. The calibrated ball SAW TMA outputted a similar concentration to that observed by a CRDS TMA, which is the most reliable standard for trace moisture measurement. The 10%–90% response time to a concentration change at a flow rate of 1 l/min for the ball SAW TMA was about half that of the CRDS TMA, suggesting that moisture of −80 °CFP can be measured within only 1 min. The detection limit at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 was estimated to be 0.05 ppbv. From these results, it was shown that a ball SAW TMA can be realized using the BUS circuit. Future tasks are to integrate the module circuit blocks on a board and to reduce the response time and response delay by optimizing the pipe system in the TMA. An investigation of the long-term stability of the system is currently in progress. In future, the prototype system will be developed into a compact, fast, and sensitive TMA.
