Effects of cross-linking on partitioning of nanoparticles into a polymer brush: Coarse-grained simulations test simple approximate theories
The effect of cohesive contacts or, equivalently, dynamical cross-linking on the equilibrium morphology of a polymer brush infiltrated by nanoparticles that are attracted to the polymer strands is studied for plane-grafted brushes using coarse-grained molecular dynamics and approximate statistical mechanical models. In particular, the Alexander-de Gennes (AdG) and Strong Stretching Theory (SST) mean-field theory (MFT) models are considered. It is found that for values of the MFT cross-link strength interaction parameter beyond a certain threshold, both AdG and SST models predict that the polymer brush will be in a compact state of nearly uniform density packed next to the grafting surface over a wide range of solution phase nanoparticle concentrations. Coarse grained molecular dynamics simulations confirm this prediction, for both small nanoparticles (nanoparticle volume = monomer volume) and large nanoparticles (nanoparticle volume = 27 × monomer volume). Simulation results for these cross-linked systems are compared with analogous results for systems with no cross-linking. At the same solution phase nanoparticle concentration, strong cross-linking results in additional compression of the brush relative to the non-crosslinked analog and, at all but the lowest concentrations, to a lesser degree of infiltration by nanoparticles. For large nanoparticles, the monomer density profiles show clear oscillations moving outwards from the grafting surface, corresponding to a degree of layering of the absorbed nanoparticles in the brush as they pack against the grafting surface.
I. INTRODUCTION
When polymer chains are grafted at one end to a solid support surface, and the grafting density is sufficiently high that the conformations of neighboring chains overlap, the chains tend to elongate into a “brush” motif [1,2]. Polymer brushes have interesting properties [3–6] which can differ substantially from those of the corresponding polymer solution (without grafting) [7]. Under appropriate conditions, molecules or nanoparticles in solution can partition into the brush phase. One way this may happen is if there are specific attractions between the solution phase nanoparticles and monomers of the polymer chains. The presence of these nanoparticles in the polymer brush will in general modify the morphology of brushes—for example, cause the brush to contract or extend relative to its extension (“height”) in the absence of nanoparticles [8–13]. Infiltration of nanoparticles into a polymer brush layer can also give rise to more subtle effects such as micro-phase separation [11]. Similar effects can be obtained when a polymer brush is immersed in two solvents, with one of the solvent species being preferentially attracted to the brush monomers [14–16]. Using targeted monomer-nanoparticle interactions to control brush morphology provides a way to make “smart polymers,” which could in principle be used for size-selective sieving of analyte molecules [17,18], as well as for applications in lubrication [4,6,19] and fuel cells [20]. Other control mechanisms such as change in temperature [21], pH [22], or ionic strength [23,24] have also been proposed.
In addition to short-range repulsion between monomers of the polymer chain and connectivity between successive members of a single chain, there may also be longer-range attraction between certain monomer pairs, both within a single chain and between two different chains. In some systems, this attraction stems from covalent bond formation between monomer pairs. In others it arises from non-bonded interactions such as Coulombic attraction between oppositely charged groups or hydrophobic forces. Covalent (“chemical”) cross-linking will generally be very strong so that once a cross-linking bond between monomers is formed, it is permanent [25,26]. Cross-linking due to non-bonding interactions will generally be weaker (of the order of several k_{B}T) so that cross-linking between any two monomers is transient: cross-links are constantly being formed and then broken [8,27–30]. We shall refer to this here as “dynamical cross-linking.” Clearly, the strength of the cross-linking between polymer monomers will influence the degree to which attractive nanoparticles, i.e., nanoparticles that attract to polymer monomers, are able to penetrate into the polymer layer and the extent to which they modify the polymer morphology in the process.
Cross-linking will cause the brush layer to compress more than it would in the absence of cross-linking, all other factors being equal. If nanoparticles are subsequently added into solution, their ability to partition into the brush and the degree to which the brush can contract further will be restricted when the brush is crosslinked by, among other things, short ranged steric effects. If the concentration of nanoparticles in solution is increased sufficiently, the thermodynamic impetus to equalize the nanoparticle chemical potential inside and outside the brush region will drive more nanoparticles into the brush, which requires that the brush swell (extend in height) in order to accommodate them.
Such general qualitative behavior can be anticipated on intuitive grounds, but a full understanding requires detailed computations [29,30]. In the present paper, we present results of coarse-grained Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations which compare the properties of crosslinked brush systems with their non-crosslinked analogs, focusing particularly on systems that include nanoparticles in the solution that bathes the polymer brush. In addition, we assess the accuracy of two simple mean-field theory (MFT) approximations that have been used extensively in previous work [10,11,31,32] to provide insight into polymer brush-nanoparticle systems.
The two MFT approximations of interest are due, respectively, to Alexander and de Gennes, to be termed the AdG model [33,34], and to Milner, Witten, and Cates and Zhulina et_al, to be termed the Strong Stretching Theory (SST) model [35–37]. Both models were originally formulated for pure brush systems but have since been generalized to include the presence of additional nanoparticles in the solution [10,11]. These models are closely related, but in general give distinct results. For a plane-grafted brush, the AdG model presumes a uniform density of both polymer monomers and nanoparticles in the brush region, whereas the SST model allows for spatially varying densities. However, we find that in the case of strong physical cross-linking, the AdG and SST approximations essentially coincide, i.e., the SST approximation also predicts step-like functions for the monomer density and the nanoparticle density inside the brush region. This coincidence holds over the entire range of solution phase nanoparticle concentrations, from no nanoparticles (“pure brush”) to concentrated nanoparticle solutions. Moreover, MD simulations are found to be consistent with the predictions of SST/AdG in this regime, thus building confidence that even the simple AdG model gives a qualitatively correct picture of the polymer brush morphology (e.g., its degree of extension).
The outline of this paper is as follows. In Sec. II, we review essential elements of the AdG and SST theories, including effects of monomer cross-linking that are encoded in these models via an attractive monomer-monomer interaction potential. In Sec. III, we briefly summarize our coarse-grained MD simulation model, which incorporates cross-linking as an attractive Lennard-Jones (LJ) pair potential between select monomers. In Sec. IV, we present MD simulation results and compare these to the corresponding predictions of SST and AdG theories. Our focus is on ascertaining the effects of cross-linking interactions on the polymer brush morphology in the case of both small nanoparticles (having the same size as the monomers) and large nanoparticles (having a volume much greater than the monomer volume). Details of the concomitant nanoparticle infiltration process are also studied. Section V contains discussion and conclusions. Note that while there has been some previous theoretical/computational work on partitioning of nanoparticles (or “nano-inclusions”) into a polymer brush [10,11,30,38–43] and on cross-linking effects on polymer brush morphology [29,30,44,45], the detailed study of the interplay of these processes, guided by the predictions of simple mean-field theories, distinguishes the work presented here from previous studies.
II. THEORY
Let ψ = volume fraction of polymer monomers, ϕ = volume fraction of nanoparticles, and v = (nanoparticle volume/monomer volume). Throughout this paper, we measure length in units of the monomer diameter b and all energies in units of k_{B}T. Note that if we measure number density (“concentration”) in units of b^{−3}, then volume fraction=v×(concentration). So, for the monomers of the polymer, volume fraction and concentration are interchangeable terms, whereas for nanoparticles, volume fraction is a factor v larger than concentration.
Both the Alexander-de Gennes (AdG) and Strong Stretching Theory (SST) approximations make use of the same non-elastic free energy density, which we take to be
In Eq. (1), χ represents the mean-field monomer-nanoparticle interaction energy parameter. (Note that χ<0 corresponds to attractive monomer-nanoparticle interactions.) Similarly, χ_{cr} represents the mean-field monomer-monomer interaction energy parameter, utilized to incorporate cross-linking into the model. χ_{cr}<0 corresponds to attractive interactions between monomer pairs, which we will interpret as cross-linking (alternatively termed “cohesion”). The free energy density function in Eq. (1) is not unique but has been developed as a reasonable way to incorporate monomer-nanoparticle interactions (first term), monomer-monomer cross-linking interactions (last term), and various mixing entropy and excluded volume effects (middle three terms) in previous work [10,11,29]. Also note that we will consider plane-grafted systems throughout this paper.
A. AdG theory
Let a = chain grafting distance and N = # monomers per chain. Per chain, the free energy of the brush phase is given by
where h = brush height, which is related to the monomer volume fraction by ψ=N/ha^{2}. The 1st term on the rhs of Eq. (2) accounts for the elastic (stretching) free energy of the chain. The structure of the elastic free energy term here is a consequence of adopting a flexible Gaussian chain model [7] for the configurations of each polymer chain. Thus, effects of polymer stiffness are ignored. Our MD simulation model will be constructed accordingly, in order to facilitate direct comparison between MD simulations and AdG/SST approximation predictions. (See Sec. III.) From Eq. (2), we can compute the pressure P_{B} and nanoparticle chemical potential μ_{np,B} in the brush phase. We start with the fundamental relations P_{B}=−∂F_{B}∂V_{B} and μ_{np,B}=∂F_{B}∂N_{B}, where V_{B}=ha^{2} is the brush volume per polymer chain and N_{B}=V_{B}ϕ/v is the number of nanoparticles in the brush per polymer chain. Then
The free energy density for the solution phase is obtained simply by setting ψ=0 in Eq. (1), i.e.,
where c = volume fraction of nanoparticles in the solution phase. This implies the solution phase pressure
and nanoparticle chemical potential
Note that Eq. (5) describes the free energy of a non-ideal solution which incorporates excluded volume effects at finite values of solute (nanoparticle) volume fraction c. For c<< 1, the solution becomes ideal, as is clear from the limiting forms of P_{S}(c) and μ_{np,S}(c).
At thermal equilibrium, the nanoparticle chemical potentials in the brush phase and the solution phase must be equal, i.e.,
Furthermore, the system pressure must be equal in the two phases, i.e.,
Simultaneous solution of Eqs. (8a) and (8b) yields the values of ψ,ϕ in the brush under equilibrium conditions.
Equivalent to the direct solution of the two equations for nanoparticle chemical potential and system pressure, one can construct the auxiliary thermodynamic potential,
The first line of Eq. (9) shows that minimizing Φ with respect to the extensive variables V_{B},N_{B} is tantamount to equating (i) the system pressure and (ii) the nanoparticle chemical potential in brush and solution phases, as required by Eq. (8). The second line shows that this can be recast as a minimization with respect to the intensive variables ψ,ϕ which are both confined to the range [0,1]. Alternatively, one can solve the nanoparticle chemical potential balance Eq. (8a) for a system with specified monomer density ψ. Denoting this local equilibrium nanoparticle density as ϕ¯(ψ), finding the minimum of the one-variable function
yields the same system composition (ψ,ϕ) as the minimization of the two-variable function Φ(ψ,ϕ) in Eq. (8). For some parameter sets, the thermodynamic potentials in Eqs. (9) and (10) may possess two local minima [10]. In such cases, the composition corresponding to the lower free energy value is selected as the desired equilibrium state.
B. Strong Stretching Theory (SST)
In this approximation within the context of self-consistent field theory, the non-elastic free energy density function is the same as in the case of the AdG model. In SST theory, the monomer and nanoparticle densities vary in the z direction (the system is taken to be laterally homogeneous in the xy plane, i.e., parallel to the grafting surface), so f in Eq. (1) is regarded as a local function of ψ(z),ϕ(z). However, the elastic stretching free energy of the grafted polymer chains is modified from the simple quadratic dependence on brush height indicated in Eq. (2) to a form that allows for spatially local stretching [11,35]. The set of chain configurations that minimizes the appropriate thermodynamic potential for this system is computed and is assumed to dominate the configurations accessed under conditions of thermal equilibrium, as detailed in Refs [11],  [35], and  [37].
The SST solution procedure generates a monomer density profile ψ(z)which is positive between the grafting surface (z = 0) and the termination point of the brush at its untethered end, which is located at z = h > 0. (h is referred to as the brush height.) Operationally, one computes
with ϕ¯(ψ) defined above. Upon minimization of the thermodynamic potential alluded to in the preceding paragraph (see Ref [11] for full details), the spatial dependence of the monomer density profile is determined by the following relation:
where B=π^{2}/8N^{2}. Here A is a normalization constant which is adjusted to self-consistency, i.e., to account for the chosen polymer chain length N and the surface density of grafted polymers σ=1/a^{2} according to
where h is the brush height, such that the monomer density is 0 for z > h. Details of how h is determined in different regimes are provided below.
For a system without cross-linking (χ_{cr}=0), the brush morphology in the absence of nanoparticles is well described within SST as parabolic, i.e., ψ decreases monotonically from a maximum value at the grafting surface to the value ψ=0 at the brush height z = h, approximately following the form of a parabola with negative curvature [35]. When attractive nanoparticles are introduced into the system, they spontaneously partition into the brush. At low solution phase nanoparticle volume fraction c, the degree of brush compression is minor and the brush shape remains nearly parabolic. An example of such a profile is shown in Fig. 1(d). Operationally, this behavior traces to the fact that μ(ψ) increases monotonically on the interval 0<ψ<1, as illustrated in Fig. 1(a). Let us denote this as regime 1.
For sufficiently strong monomer-nanoparticle attraction, at a threshold value of c=c_{1}* the function μ(ψ) develops a van der Waals loop. [See Fig. 1(a) for a schematic illustration of the structure of the μ(ψ) curve as a function of nanoparticle volume fraction c.] This loop can be excised using a Maxwell equal area construction in the μ−ψ plane, which renders the corrected μ(ψ) curve monotonically non-decreasing over the entire range 0<ψ<1[cf. Fig. 1(b)] [46]. This implies ψ(z) which, again, decreases monotonically from its value at the grafting surface. In contrast to the situation in regime 1, in the region of an excisable van der Waals loop, ψ(z) has a sharp interface at a particular value z̃ in the range 0<z̃<h, where ψ jumps discontinuously from a value ψ_{h} (approaching from z<z̃) to a lower value ψ_{l} (approaching from z>z̃), as illustrated in Fig. 1(d). The osmotic pressure P_{os} of the system is continuous across this interface, i.e., P_{os}(ψ_{h})=P_{os}(ψ_{l}), with the explicit formula for P_{os} given by
Note that this is the non-elastic component of pressure in the polymer phase [the rhs of Eq. (3), neglecting the 1st term], evaluated under conditions where the nanoparticles have equilibrated in the brush so that their local volume fraction at a point z is ϕ¯(ψ(z)). Beyond the location z̃ where the discontinuity in ψ occurs, the brush decreases monotonically and continuously from ψ_{l} to the value ψ=0 at z = h, at which point it terminates; cf. Fig. 1(d). We denote this behavior as the characteristic of regime 2.
As the solution phase nanoparticle volume fraction c is further increased, the corresponding value of ψ_{l} decreases until it reaches the value ψ_{l}=0, that is, the value the brush density drops discontinuously from a non-zero value ψ_{h} to the value ψ=0 at a particular value of z=h. This value of z is identified as the brush height, since the brush does not extend out further (i.e., ψ=0 for z > h). Note that the brush now has the property that at its edge, where the monomer density is ψ_{h} (approaching from z < h), the osmotic pressure of the brush is equal to that in the solution phase, i.e., P_{os}(ψ_{h})=P_{os}(0).
Denoting the nanoparticle volume fraction at which ψ_{l}=0 becomes 0 as c_{2}* (cf. Fig. 1), then for any c>c_{2}*, the brush retains the property that it truncates sharply at z = h, i.e., the monomer density has the value ψ_{h} > 0 as one approaches from z < h and ψ=0 for z > h. The value of ψ_{h} is again determined by the condition P_{os}(ψ_{h})=P_{os}(0). [The value of ψ_{h} changes with c because the osmotic pressure in Eq. (14) depends on ϕ¯(ψ), which varies with c.] We will designate the behavior observed for c > c_{2}* as regime 3. An example of such a profile is shown in Fig. 1(d). In this regime, ψ(z) resembles a step function which has a constant positive value on the interval 0 < z < h, then drops abruptly to 0 for z > h. The SST monomer density is not precisely a step function, but this descriptor is qualitatively appropriate.
Now let us consider a system characterized by non-zero cross-linking, corresponding to χ_{cr}<0. Under conditions of weak cross-linking (|χ_{cr}|≈0), the 3-regime scenario described above is preserved. However, for sufficiently strong cross-linking, qualitatively new behavior emerges. To understand its origin, consider first the pure brush case (no nanoparticles). In the context of SST theory, this cross-linked system is isomorphic to a system with a “bad solvent” (which stimulates expulsion of the solvent and concomitant compression of the brush) [46,47]. The resultant morphology is precisely that found in regime 3 described above, i.e., the monomer density decreases as one moves away from the grafting surface and terminates at position z = h having a finite value of ψ (denoted as ψ_{h}), beyond which ψ=0 (the brush does not extend to z > h). This collapsed phase sets in when the function μ(ψ) becomes non-monotonic on 0<ψ<1, which occurs when the coefficient of ψ^{1} in the power series expansion of μ(ψ) becomes negative, i.e., in our model [Eq. (11) with ϕ¯=0], when χ_{cr}<−1. Thus, when χ_{cr}<−1, the brush is already in regime 3 before any attractive nanoparticles are added to the system, according to SST theory. When attractive nanoparticles are introduced, these get absorbed into the brush, eventually causing it to swell outward. Importantly, the system remains in regime 3 over the entire range of nanoparticle concentrations 0 < c < 1. [This is determined in the context of SST by the fact that μ(ψ) has a negative slope at ψ→0^{+}; see Fig. 1(c).] Polymer morphology regimes 1 and 2 are not observed at any nanoparticle concentration c when χ_{cr}<−1 (strongly crosslinked brush).
III. COARSE-GRAINED SIMULATION MODEL
In order to verify whether the essential features of polymer morphology predicted from the AdG/SST approximations are observed in a full equilibrium statistical mechanical model where monomer particles in many grafted chains and multiple nanoparticles interact via appropriate pair potentials, we have also performed extensive coarse-grained Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to simulate Boltzmann equilibrium in the fully interacting many-particle system. We employ a coarse-grained bead spring simulation model for the polymer chains. All monomers are represented as spheres having the same diameter σ_{m}. Monomers are of two types: one type has only short range repulsive (excluded volume) interactions with all other monomers. The 2nd type of monomer is “sticky,” by which we mean that in addition to excluded volume interactions, it has attractive interactions with all other “sticky” monomers. (This is how cross-linking is introduced into the simulation model.) The sticky monomers alternate in each chain with non-sticky ones, as depicted schematically in Fig. 2. This scheme is not unique, but it is perhaps the simplest one imaginable. In the AdG/SST models, variations in the frequency of occurrence of the sticky beads and the binding strength between these beads are subsumed into a single mean-field energy parameterχ_{cr}. In the present study, we will focus on the representation of cross-linking interactions in the simulation system illustrated in Fig. 2. More sophisticated variants, which might involve the random placement of the sticky beads along the polymer chains, or alternating segments (“blocks”) of sticky and non-sticky beads on each chain are left for future work.
The interaction potential between all pairs of sticky monomers is given by the modified Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential,
where ε is the energy unit of the LAMMPS simulation, and ε_{cr}>0 is the depth of the monomer-monomer binding well. Interactions between all other monomer pairs (two non-sticky monomers or a sticky/non-sticky monomer pair) are given by the truncated LJ potential,
with r_{c,m}=2^{1/6}σ_{m}.
The remaining details of the coarse-grained model and simulation procedure are as described in previous papers reporting LAMMPS [48] based coarse-grained simulations of a polymer brush infiltrated by attractive nanoparticles [31,32]. The term “attractive nanoparticle” here means that there is an attractive pair interaction between each nanoparticle and each monomer. The monomer-nanoparticle pair potential, which is characterized by a well depth (binding energy) ε_{b}, has a modified LJ form due to the generally un-equal diameter of the monomer and the nanoparticle. The details of this functional form have been described in previous work [11,32]. In addition to these LJ-type potentials between all pairs of particles in the system, adjacent monomers in the same polymer chain are connected by a finitely extensible nonlinear elastic (FENE) spring potential [49], i.e., we employ the polymer chain model of Grest and Kremer [50,51]. Each chain is attached at one end to a flat surface. A square grafting pattern is generated with the length of the side of the square (the shortest distance between grafted anchor points) being a. In this paper, we restrict our calculations to a = 4. All particles in the system are coupled to a Langevin thermostat in order to establish a canonical equilibrium distribution of particle configurations corresponding to a specified system temperature. Here the masses of all particles in the system are taken to be equal (since we are only interested in the distribution of configurations that arises under long time steady state conditions), and we choose T=ε/k_{B} so that binding energies are in units of k_{B}T. Our simulations are performed for a system of 10 × 10 = 100 grafted chains in a box just large enough to contain these laterally. Periodic boundary conditions are employed in the lateral (x,y) directions, while fixed walls are employed in the z direction (with the z direction being perpendicular to the grafting surface): one wall is utilized as the polymer grafting surface and the other is placed far from the free edge of the polymer brush. Nanoparticles are initially inserted into the solution region of the system (outside of the brush) and allowed to partition into the brush over the course of the MD simulation. We wait until dynamical equilibrium (steady state) is achieved and then monitor properties such as the time-averaged monomer and nanoparticle densities along the z axis. Given these density profiles, the extension (“height”) of the brush can be calculated. In particular, we set the brush height h as the value of z at which, on average, 99.5% of the monomers have z < h.
IV. RESULTS: SIMULATION VS. THEORY IN THE CROSS-LINKED SYSTEMS
A central challenge in comparing SST/AdG to simulation results is determining the mean-field energy parameters χ,χ_{cr} which correspond to given MD simulation conditions—in particular, to the Lennard-Jones (LJ) binding energies ε_{b},ε{cr}. The cross-linking strength is a property of the pure brush (i.e., independent of the size and binding strength of any nanoparticles that may penetrate into the brush). Hence, we will first consider the pure brush system in order to establish a connection between the parameters χ_{cr} and ε_{cr}. Subsequently, we will consider systems without cross-linking to establish a connection between χ and ε_{b}. Once appropriate values of χ,χ_{cr} have been chosen, we will calculate the characteristics for nanoparticle-infiltrated brush systems with and without cross-linking, comparing the predictions of the SST and AdG approximations to simulation results. A summary of the various simulation conditions considered in this paper is given in Table I.
A. No nanoparticles
Establishing a quantitative connection between the mean-field parameter χ_{cr} and the LJ binding strength between monomers is not completely straightforward. We expect that |χ_{cr}|∝ε{cr}, roughly [11,32], but the constant of proportionality is best determined empirically. Using simulations with grafting distance a = 4 and a range of ε_{cr} values, and comparing these to SST calculations, we arrive at the correspondence χ_{cr}≅−0.65ε{cr} for the simulation system under study here. Comparison of SST and simulation results for the monomer density as a function of position along the z axis is shown in Fig. 3. The polymer chain length in these simulations is N = 400, and the z axis is scaled according to the relation z_{sc}=(100/N)z=z/4. (The reason for scaling z in this fashion will become clear below.) This level of agreement suffices for present purposes.
In Fig. 4, we focus on the case where ε_{cr}=2.0, corresponding to χ_{cr}=−1.3. This value of ε_{cr} is large enough to have a significant effect on polymer brush morphology and nanoparticle infiltration into the brush, as will be shown below, but is not so strong that it permanently sutures the polymer strands together. Since ε_{cr} is on the order of k_{B}T, we expect that LJ bonding interactions between pairs of sticky monomers will result in transient contacts (interparticle separation is approximately the LJ diameter of the monomer) which break after a short period of time due to thermal fluctuations. Indeed, this behavior is observed in our simulations.
Simulation results are presented in Fig. 4 for five different chain lengths: N = 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600. It is instructive to plot on the abscissa the scaled z coordinate z_{sc}=(100/N)z because the monomer profile dilates (extends) along the z axis approximately proportionally to N, as is evident from the plot. In fact, this scaling/dilation feature is an exact property of the solutions to SST and AdG models [33–35,37,46]. Since χ_{cr}=−1.3 lies beyond the crossover transition to an abruptly discontinuous SST monomer density profile (i.e., a quasi-step function profile), we seek evidence of this feature in the MD simulations. As can be seen, for a polymer chain of finite length N, the simulation profiles round off the sharp interface predicted by SST, but as N increases this interface becomes sharper. The results shown in Fig. 4 are consistent with the conclusion that to a good approximation the brush height scales proportionally to the polymer chain length N, and, furthermore, the width of the brush edge grows less rapidly than this so that the width of the brush edge decreases in comparison to the brush height as N increases.
The interfacial behavior observed in our simulations is consistent with the fact that SST theory is most appropriate for long polymer chains [35,52]. (In this limit, configurations of the chain considered in self-consistent field theory are strongly dominated by the free energy minimizing configuration, which is the direct output of the SST approximation.) Thus the value of ε_{cr}=2.0 (again, corresponding to χ_{cr}=−1.3 in our calculations) serves as a good illustrative system for relatively strong dynamical cross-linking, to which we add attractive nanoparticles in Subsection IV B. The corresponding AdG monomer profile is also plotted in Fig. 4. It closely resembles the SST result, though the two curves ψ(z) are not identical. By construction, the AdG profile is precisely a step function, whereas the SST profile predicts that the monomer density increases as one moves towards the grafting surface from the solution.
B. Systems with nanoparticle inclusions
We have studied these previously in the absence of cross-linking [10,11,31,32]. Here we add cross-linking effects to our analysis. We will consider two sizes of nanoparticles: “small” (v = 1) and “large” (v = 27). For each nanoparticle size, we will consider the case of no cross-linking ε_{cr}=0 and of strong physical cross-linking, ε_{cr}=2.0. To set the mean-field energy parameter χ which prescribes the strength of monomer-nanoparticle attraction for a given value of ε_{b} in the simulations, we will appeal to our previous work in the absence of cross-linking. Setting the value of χ in this manner, we will leave it unchanged as we add cross-linking to the system. Because equilibration of nanoparticles into the system proceeds more slowly with increasing polymer chain length N, we will perform all simulations with N = 200 in this part of our study.
Note that it becomes difficult to obtain accurate statistics on the number of nanoparticles in solution at very low values of c because there are not many nanoparticles in the simulation system and at any given time nearly all of them are inside the brush. To obtain error bars on c (relevant for Figs. 5, 7, and 9), the calculated solution phase nanoparticle volume fractions for a simulation run are subdivided into several time blocks (between 5 and 10): the fluctuation in c is quantified by computing the standard deviation of the average values obtained for each of the blocks. Fluctuations in brush height (Figs. 5 and 7) and number of nanoparticles absorbed into the brush (Fig. 9) are smaller than the size of the data points, and therefore error bars are not shown for these quantities.
Consider the case v = 1 (small nanoparticles) first. For the LJ binding strength ε_{b}=1.5, in the absence of cross-linking, this system undergoes a significant collapse in brush height when nanoparticles infiltrate into it, as shown in Fig. 5. As more nanoparticles are added to the solution (higher values of c), the brush eventually begins to expand (“swell”) in order to accommodate inclusion of more nanoparticles. We studied this system in previous work [10,11,31,32]. For comparison to SST calculations, we adjusted the mean-field coupling parameter χ to attain maximal collapse at the same value of c (roughly c ∼ 0.01) as observed in the simulations, arriving at the choice χ=−8 in agreement with our previous findings [11,32]. As can be seen from Fig. 5, the major features of the h vs. c curve seen in the simulations are recapitulated by the SST calculations. We also show in Fig. 5 the AdG approximation for h vs. c. At high values of c, once the outward swelling process begins, the SST and AdG approximations essentially coalesce. For a given nanoparticle concentration, they both predict a near uniform (“step-function”) distribution of monomers, consistent with MD simulation results [11]. At lower values of c, however, SST and AdG give different results [35]. Again, this traces to the fact that in the simulations (representing the proper statistical mechanics of the polymer/nanoparticle many-body system), the pure polymer brush profile (i.e., in the absence of nanoparticle inclusions) is nearly parabolic (regime 1). As nanoparticles are added to the system, the brush attains a morphology characterized by a compressed fraction near the grafting surface plus a diffuse fraction that contains the free ends of some of the polymer chains at larger values of z (regime 2). This feature, clearly predicted by SST [cf. Fig. 1(d)], is seen in simulations, too [11]. Finally, at large values of c (after the brush has fully collapsed), the simulations show a single compressed phase of nearly uniform composition (regime 3). The SST approximation can accommodate the morphologies that occur in all three regimes, whereas the AdG approximation imposes a strict step-function profile in the first two regimes when it is not fully appropriate. In spite of its shortcomings, the AdG approximation is qualitatively successful over the full range of concentrations.
Now let us study the same system, but with cross-linking. Specifically, we will consider a system with ε_{cr}=2.0. Focusing first on the simulation results presented in Fig. 5, we observe the following details. In the absence of nanoparticles, cross-linking of the monomers causes the brush to compress significantly relative to the same system in the absence of cross-linking. As nanoparticles are added to the system, it initially contracts further, but not nearly as much as in the absence of cross-linking. (Cross-linking “pre-compacts” the brush before monomers are introduced, so there is less open space within the brush phase to accommodate nanoparticles.) The collapse process also commences at lower nanoparticle concentrations and occurs over a wider range of nanoparticle concentrations when cross-linking is in effect. After the brush compresses to the maximum degree possible, further addition of nanoparticles to the system causes it to swell.
We found in our simulations that equilibration of the crosslinked system is slower than in the analogous non-crosslinked system. Presumably this is due to the additional monomer-monomer attractions inherent in a system with cross-linking. To ensure that the cross-linked system did not get trapped in a nonequilibrium metastable state, we did some additional tests. Namely, we selected a snapshot from a (presumably) equilibrated system, removed approximately 20% of the nanoparticles selected at random, and then restarted the simulation. After the system re-equilibrated, corresponding to a lower solution phase concentration of nanoparticles, the h vs. c. data point fell onto the simulation curve shown in Fig. 5, thus indicating that it had independently found the same equilibrium conformation starting from a distinctly different initial condition. Similar test calculations were carried out for the large nanoparticle (v = 27) system discussed below.
Next we compare in Fig. 5 the simulation results for h vs. c to corresponding results obtained via SST and AdG theory. Note that there are no further adjustable input parameters for the SST/AdG calculations. The value of χ_{cr}=−1.3 corresponding to ε_{cr}=2.0 in the simulations was set by the analysis of the pure brush (no nanoparticle) system presented above. The value of χ=−8, corresponding to ε_{b}=1.5, was set in our previous study of the brush with v = 1 nanoparticles in the absence of cross-linking, as discussed above. From the figure it is clear that the SST and AdG approximation curves for h vs. c are nearly identical over the entire range of nanoparticle concentrations, 0 < c < 1. This is because the SST starts in regime 3 (fully collapsed) when c = 0 (pure brush system) due to the strong cross-linking in this system (i.e., beyond the χ_{cr}=−1 threshold). It then remains in regime 3 over the entire range 0 < c < 1. The major features of the h vs. c curve obtained from simulations are captured by the SST/AdG results. Among these are the absolute brush height when c = 0, decrease in brush height at intermediate concentrations, maximal fractional decrease compared to the c = 0 case, and swelling of the brush at higher values of c.
As more nanoparticles infiltrate the cross-linked brush, the monomer density profile obtained from simulations becomes more step-function-like, consistent with the fact that the SST and AdG approximations begin to coalesce. An example of this tendency is shown in Fig. 6(a), where simulation and SST/AdG results are shown for the relatively high nanoparticle concentration c = 2 × 10^{−2}. SST and AdG results are numerically indistinguishable for this system. Furthermore, the simulations show a strikingly similar step-function profile. In Fig. 6(b), we plot the monomer density profiles obtained from our simulations across the full range of nanoparticle concentrations considered in Fig. 5. Figure 6(b) makes clear that the underlying ansatz of the AdG model, namely, that the monomer density profile is a step function, is qualitatively valid for highly cross-linked systems over a wide range of nanoparticle concentrations.
Now we turn our attention to the case of a larger nanoparticle, in particular, one having the nanoparticle/monomer volume ratio v = 27. For concreteness, we choose a value of monomer-nanoparticle binding strength ε_{b}=1.5, which is strong enough to induce significant brush collapse when ε_{cr}=0 (there is no cross-linking in the system) [32].h vs. c results obtained from MD simulations are shown for this system in Fig. 7. There is again a noticeable reduction in the brush height as nanoparticles are added to the system. It is not as pronounced as in the v = 1 case considered in Fig. 5, either in terms of the fractional compression relative to the pure brush limit or the sharpness of the collapse as nanoparticle concentration is increased. This is to be expected in the case of larger nanoparticles and consistent with simulation results obtained in previous work [11,32].
These ε_{cr}=0 simulation results are compared to the analogous SST and AdG predictions. Obviously we must set χ_{cr}=0 here, but an appropriate non-zero mean-field nanoparticle-monomer coupling strength χ needs to be chosen. We do this by adjusting χ so that the position of the minimum in the h vs. c curve appears at nearly the same value of nanoparticle concentration c as in the simulations. We thus arrive at the value χ=−73 as determined in previous work [32]. The resultant SST and AdG h vs. c curves are shown in Fig. 7. It can be seen that SST and AdG predictions differ from each other more than in the case of small nanoparticles. The AdG approximation does not account as well for the brush height in the low nanoparticle concentration regime. It also predicts the collapse of the brush to occur at a significantly different value of c than SST suggests. At very high concentrations, once the system passes into regime 3 of the SST morphology classes (again, the fully collapsed, nearly uniform density brush phase), SST and AdG approximations coalesce to predict gradual swelling of the brush.
Finally, we consider the same system but with strong cross-linking, namely, ε_{cr}=2.0. Simulation results for h vs. c are presented in Fig. 7. The same general comments apply here as in the small nanoparticle case. Note that at large values of c, the brush swells enough that it stretches out beyond its value when there are no nanoparticles in the system. In Fig. 8, we examine monomer density profiles for systems spanning the wide range of nanoparticle solution concentrations presented in Fig. 7. Again, the step-function nature of these profiles is apparent, just as in the cross-linked v = 1 system described above. One interesting feature in the v = 27 results presented in Fig. 8 is the oscillations in the monomer density profile ψ(z) near the grafting surface. These oscillations are a manifestation of the build-up of partially ordered layers of nanoparticles against the grafting surface. While this effect is not predicted by the SST and AdG models, which oversimplify the behavior of the full many-body statistical mechanical system embodied in the MD simulation model, it is relatively minor here in terms of the basic description of the brush morphology (e.g., the brush extension). Interestingly, signatures of layer formation have been seen in kinetics experiments performed on grafted nucleoporin proteins, with the relevant attractive nanoparticles being globular receptor proteins that bind weakly to hydrophobic segments of the natively unfolded nucleoporins [53].
The SST and AdG h vs. c curves corresponding to ε_{cr}=2 are calculated without any further parameter changes. (The values of bothχ and χ_{cr} have already been set as described above.) As shown in Fig. 7, they are nearly identical over the entire nanoparticle volume fraction range (0 < c < 1). As in the v = 1 example above, this follows from the fact that the pure brush is already collapsed in SST theory, so the system is in regime 3 of the SST morphology classes for any c > 0. The SST/AdG predictions are in good qualitative agreement with the simulations as regards absolute brush height, degree of maximal collapse, and swelling at high values of c. The nanoparticle concentration at which the brush height attains its minimum value is noticeably different in SST/AdG vs. simulation, but given the simplistic nature of the SST and AdG approximations, as well as the large concentration range over which the compression and subsequent expansion process takes place, this level of deviation is not unexpected. Overall, the SST/AdG approximation serves as a useful qualitative guide to features that are seen in the MD simulations and provides insight as to why these features occur.
C. Nanoparticles in the brush
It is also of interest to examine the number of nanoparticles that partition into the polymer brush as a function of solution phase nanoparticle concentration for the systems whose brush morphologies were analyzed above. Changes in brush morphology are directly triggered by nanoparticle infiltration: the two processes are concomitant. As an example, we present in Fig. 9 results for the system with v = 27. Results are presented for both the non-crosslinked brush system, ε_{cr}=0, and the strongly crosslinked system corresponding to ε_{cr}=2.0. We plot on the ordinate the number of nanoparticles in the brush per grafted polymer chain.
The following features are apparent. The number of nanoparticles in the brush increases monotonically with solution phase nanoparticle volume fraction c with and without cross-linking. No saturation in the infiltration (“binding”) process is observed at high nanoparticle concentrations. All other system characteristics being equal, at the same nanoparticle concentration fewer nanoparticles go into the crosslinked brush than its non-crosslinked analog, except at very low values of c, when there are almost no nanoparticles in the brush. The nanoparticle uptakes predicted by SST and AdG approximations are similar to each other for both systems studied in Fig. 9. For the sake of visual clarity, we plot only the AdG approximation, which is seen to be in good qualitative agreement with the simulation results. (All AdG input parameters are the same as specified in the discussion of polymer morphology properties above.)
V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
Cross-linking of filaments in a polymer brush can strongly affect the equilibrium morphology of the brush and the degree to which nanoparticles in the system partition into it. The cross-linking process, which at a basic physical level arises from attractive contacts between a chosen set of monomers in the brush (including contacts between monomers on different filaments), causes the brush to compress relative to its height in the absence of cross-linking. This effect occurs in the absence of attractive nanoparticles in solution, i.e., it is a property of the pure brush. Having a more compressed brush featuring binding contacts between strands that partly suture the brush structure together (with the degree of suturing depending on the attractive cross-linking binding energy) influences the extent to which particles can partition into the brush. Moreover, since the brush is already significantly compressed, infiltration of nanoparticles into the brush cannot cause significant further brush collapse. Instead, as nanoparticles are forced into the brush by increasing their concentration in solution, the brush must expand (“swell”) to accommodate them. These general considerations explain the observed tendency of crosslinked brushes to extend beyond the height of the pure brush when attractive nanoparticles are introduced into the system [9,29,53].
Dynamical cross-linking should occur to some extent in all polymer brushes, due to non-covalent intermolecular interactions such as Coulomb (charge-charge) attractions or hydrophobic forces. An example where these interactions are significant enough to influence both the brush morphology and the degree of infiltration into the brush of nanoparticles which attract to brush monomers is provided by recent experiments of Lim et_al [29,53,54] and Richter et_al [30] These groups grafted natively unfolded protein filaments (“polymer strands”) extracted from the Nuclear Pore Complex to a solid support and then introduced appropriate globular proteins (“nanoparticles”) which are known to attract to segments of the grafted proteins due to hydrophobic interactions. Furthermore, direct hydrophobic interactions between segments in the grafted proteins lead to dynamical cross-linking in this system. Theoretical analysis [29,30] has revealed a complex and intriguing interplay of the cross-linking strength, monomer-nanoparticle attraction, grafting density, and nanoparticle size, consistent with the themes expounded in the present paper.
In this paper, we have studied two simple mean-field theory approximations, namely, the Alexander-de Gennes (AdG) model and Strong Stretching Theory (SST), for systems that include monomer cross-linking. For strong dynamical cross-linking, we find that the AdG and SST approximations give essentially the same results over the entire regime of possible nanoparticle concentrations in solution, i.e., nanoparticle volume fractions 0 < c < 1. Technically, this traces to the fact that when c = 0 (pure brush case), the brush is already in regime 3 of the SST approximation morphology classes, corresponding to a densely packed brush phase with a nearly constant monomer density. As nanoparticles are added, the SST solutions remain in regime 3, thus maintaining this morphology for all nanoparticle concentrations. The SST solutions then closely resemble the corresponding AdG solutions, the latter being directly premised on the assumption that the monomer density of the brush is uniform and terminates sharply at the brush tip at all values of c.
MD simulations confirm that this description of the equilibrium morphology of the brush/nanoparticle system with cross-linking is qualitatively accurate. Only one model of cross-linking has been studied in quantitative detail in the present work, namely, cross-linking is represented by having every other bead in each polymer chain be “sticky.” It may turn out that more chemically realistic representations of the cross-linking process lead to qualitatively different effects. Such issues must be left for future investigation. In the model examined here, the brush is found to be in a compact state (quasi-step function profile) over the entire nanoparticle volume fraction range 0 < c < 1. The sharp edge of the brush is rounded off due to the finite length of the polymer chains, but the basic interfacial features predicted by SST/AdG are present.
With some empirical calibration of SST/AdG energy parameters, agreement with simulations can be made semi-quantitative. After such calibration, it seems reasonable to expect that the SST/AdG approximations will correctly predict trends in the system morphology as a function of grafting density, polymer chain length, nanoparticle size, and energies for both monomer-nanoparticle and monomer-monomer (cross-linking) contacts. In the case of strong cross-linking, the simplistic AdG approximation should be qualitatively accurate over the entire possible range of nanoparticle concentrations, which is welcome news since this approximation is particularly simple to implement.

FIG. 1. 
Representative plots of μ(ψ) vs. ψ for a system characterized by v=1, a = 4, and χ=−8. Panels (a) and (b) pertain to the situation where χ_{cr}=0 (no cross-linking). Panel (a) shows μ(ψ) vs. ψ for the nanoparticle volume fractions c = 0, 3.5 × 10^{−3}, 8 × 10^{−3}, 2 × 10^{−2}. The volume fraction range in which there is an excisable van der Waals (vdW) loop extends from c_{1}* ≈3.5×10^{−3} to c_{2}* ≈8×10^{−3}. Regime 1 corresponds to the volume fraction range 0<c<c_{1}*, regime 2 spans c_{1}* <c<c_{2}*, and regime 3 corresponds to c>c_{2}*. Panel (b) shows μ(ψ) vs. ψ for nanoparticle volume fraction c=6×10^{−3}, which lies in the excisable vdW loop regime. Application of a Maxwell equal area construction to excise the vdW loop generates the corrected μ(ψ)shown via the dotted-dashed line. Note the horizontal tie line that extends from ψ_{l}≈0.13 to ψ_{h}≈0.57 here. Panel (c) pertains to the situation where χ_{cr}=−1.3 (strong cross-linking). Plots of μ(ψ) vs. ψ are shown for c = 0, 5 × 10^{−4}, 10^{−3}, 3 × 10^{−3}. This system lies in regime 3 over the entire nanoparticle volume fraction range 0 < c < 1. Panel (d) illustrates monomer density profiles ψ(z) vs. z calculated via SST for polymer chain length N = 100 with χ_{cr}=0 (no cross-linking) and v = 1, a = 4, χ=−8. Nanoparticle concentrations c = 5 × 10^{−5}, 6 × 10^{−3}, and 2 × 10^{−2} correspond to regimes 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Note that when c = 6 × 10^{−3} (regime 2 case), a sharp interface in ψ(z) occurs at z̃≈8.6.

The SST approximants to these four curves are also presented, using the proportionality χ_{cr}=−0.65ε{cr}.
FIG. 4. 
More detailed look at ψ(z) vs. the scaled variable z_{sc}=100z/N for the case of a pure brush with a = 4 and ε_{cr}=2.0. Simulation results are presented for five different polymer chain lengths, N = 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600. The corresponding SST and AdG results, obtained using the mean-field cross-linking strength parameterχ_{cr}=−1.3, are also displayed. Note that as the polymer chain length used in the simulations increases, all other parameters being held constant, the edge in the monomer profile sharpens considerably, bringing it into closer agreement with the step function discontinuity at the termination point of the brush predicted by SST and AdG theories for this value of χ_{cr}.
