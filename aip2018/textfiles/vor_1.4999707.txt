Modeling of negative ion extraction from a magnetized plasma source: Derivation of scaling laws and description of the origins of aberrations in the ion beam
We model the extraction of negative ions from a high brightness high power magnetized negative ion source. The model is a Particle-In-Cell (PIC) algorithm with Monte-Carlo Collisions. The negative ions are generated only on the plasma grid surface (which separates the plasma from the electrostatic accelerator downstream). The scope of this work is to derive scaling laws for the negative ion beam properties versus the extraction voltage (potential of the first grid of the accelerator) and plasma density and investigate the origins of aberrations on the ion beam. We show that a given value of the negative ion beam perveance correlates rather well with the beam profile on the extraction grid independent of the simulated plasma density. Furthermore, the extracted beam current may be scaled to any value of the plasma density. The scaling factor must be derived numerically but the overall gain of computational cost compared to performing a PIC simulation at the real plasma density is significant. Aberrations appear for a meniscus curvature radius of the order of the radius of the grid aperture. These aberrations cannot be cancelled out by switching to a chamfered grid aperture (as in the case of positive ions).
I. INTRODUCTION
Negative ion sources are used in a variety of research fields and applications [1] such as in tandem type electrostatic accelerators, cyclotrons, storage rings in synchrotrons, nuclear and particle physics, and in magnetic fusion devices. In magnetic fusion applications, negative ion sources are a subset of a Neutral Beam Injector [2] (NBI) producing high power neutral beams which are injected into the Tokamak plasma. These fusion type negative ion sources are a large volume, tandem type (i.e., a discharge and an expansion chamber) and work at low pressure (∼0.3 Pa). The plasma is generated typically by hot cathodes (heated filaments) or Radio-Frequency (RF) antennas (Inductively Coupled-Plasma discharges) standing either inside or outside the discharge [1]. Negative ions are generated on a cesiated grid (which is called the “plasma grid (PG)” in contact with the plasma) as a byproduct of the bombardment of fast hydrogen or deuterium atoms [3]. The negative atomic hydrogen (deuterium) ions are extracted through the plasma grid (PG) apertures by the high potential of an extraction grid (EG) (first grid of the NBI's electrostatic accelerator), respectively. The negative ion current produced on the PG is typically space charge saturated and a virtual cathode forms in front of the grid surface [4] (the plasma potential presents a minimum in front of the electrode, which limits the extracted negative ion current). The flux of plasma particles (positive ions and electrons) impacting the PG controls both the shape and the magnitude of the cathode potential. More negative ions may hence escape the PG surface in a plasma compared to the hypothetical situation in which the PG surface would be in vacuum.
In this work, we study the influence of the plasma density on the negative ion extraction dynamics in order to derive scaling laws that can qualitatively describe the ion beam characteristics independent of the chosen value of the simulated plasma density. The numerical method is based on a Particle-In-Cell algorithm with Monte-Carlo collisions (PIC-MCCs) [5,6]. The simulation domain is restricted to a zoom around a single aperture, with transverse dimensions related to the spacing between aperture rows and columns and axially a length of the order of the distance from the PG where the plasma properties are not influenced anymore by the extraction potential, i.e., typically a few centimeters behind the plasma meniscus [7–10]. We model two extraction aperture geometries: (i) slit apertures with a diameter of 8 mm and (ii) cylindrical apertures with a radius r_{a} = 4 mm. The former may be simulated with a 2D PIC-MCC algorithm while the latter requires a 3D model. In 3D, the simulation domain has a length Δx ≃ 3.2 cm (including the first accelerator grid downstream the PG) and a transverse cross-section of 1.2 × 1.2 cm^{2}. PIC-MCC algorithms must solve for the Debye length on the numerical grid and use time steps smaller than the transit time for a thermal electron to cross a grid cell otherwise a numerical instability will be generated. In fusion-type negative ion sources, the plasma density in the vicinity of the PG is of the order of 1 to 4 × 10^{17} m^{−3}. In the ITER prototype ion source at BATMAN [11–14] (BAvarian Test MAchine for Negative ions, Max-Planck-Institut für Plasmaphysik, Garching, Germany), for instance, a positive ion density of n_{p} ≃ 1.5 × 10^{17} m^{−3} for 60 kW of RF power in the discharge and a hydrogen background gas pressure of 0.3 Pa (Refs [13] and  [14]) are measured 2.2 cm from the cesiated PG surface (there are 140 chamfered cylindrical apertures on the electrode [11]). The restriction on the numerical grid spacing which is of the order of the Debye length implies that about 1.2 × 10^{9} grid points are necessary (assuming a plasma density of 3 × 10^{17} m^{−3}) and ∼5 × 10^{6} time steps (corresponding to an integrated time of ∼25 μs). A steady state solution is reached after a large number of time steps because of the slow buildup of the negative ion density around the grid aperture. The PIC-MCC algorithm is parallelized using both OpenMP [15] and the Message-Passing-Interface (MPI) libraries [16]. The performance of the particle pusher is about 1.5×10^{−7}s·core·particle^{−1} (we implemented a particle-decomposition scheme). Assuming 40 particles per cell (a sufficiently large number of macroparticles is required for convergence [17,18], one time step would amount to ∼2 h in serial (one core) for the pusher alone. Using such a large number of mesh points and time steps is hence not practical even with today's computers especially when one wants to perform parameter scans.
In Sec. II, we describe the numerical model in detail. In Sec. III, we show that the extraction of positive ions does indeed scale proportionally with the plasma density (in this example, negative ions are not implemented). The extraction voltage must be scaled in accordance with the Child-Langmuir law. Section IV models the extraction of negative ions from a slit aperture (2D PIC-MCC algorithm) versus the plasma density and extraction voltage. We demonstrate that the extracted beam current scales also qualitatively with the plasma density provided that a correction factor is added. No scaling factor is required to model the beam profile (the perveance is conserved). Aberrations appear on the negative ion beam when the plasma meniscus has a small curvature radius. The aberrations cannot be corrected in the model by a modification of the shape of the extraction aperture (a Pierce-like chamfered aperture instead of a rectangular slit). Negative ion extraction from a cylindrical aperture (3D PIC-MCC model) is simulated in Sec. V. The question of the co-extraction of electrons is left to future work.
II. NUMERICAL MODEL
We simulate the extraction of negative ions using a parallel Cartesian electrostatic explicit PIC-MCC model [5,6]. In an explicit algorithm, the particle trajectories are calculated based on the fields evaluated at the previous time step. The (self) electric field is derived self-consistently from the densities estimated on the grid nodes of the simulation domain. The time step must be a fraction of the electron plasma period and the grid size close to the electron Debye length, accordingly (both are set by the lightest of the simulated particles). The parallelization is performed in a hybrid manner using OpenMP [15] and MPI libraries [16]. We implemented the magnetic field configuration typically encountered in fusion-type negative ion sources [11], that is a filter and a so-called electron suppression field near the apertures (the latter is generated by permanent magnets embedded in the first grid of the accelerator). Both magnetic fields are prescribed in this work. The filter field is the largest inside the expansion chamber, which is the second section of a tandem-type ion source (the first one, being the discharge). The field lines are perpendicular to the outflow of particles produced inside the discharge. Electrons are magnetized (while ions are not) and the filter field typically induces a significant decrease of the electron temperature and current in the vicinity of the PG. This is beneficial for the survival of the negative ions. The suppression magnetic field has the shape of a cusp surrounding an aperture and is an additional barrier further lowering the current of electrons which is co-extracted with the negative ions.
The simulation domain is described in Fig. 1. It is restricted to a single aperture and has, respectively, dimensions of 3.2 × 1.6 cm^{2} in 2D (slit aperture geometry, Secs. III and IV) or 3.2 × 1.2^{2} cm^{3} in 3D (cylindrical aperture, Sec. V). The (minimum) diameter of the aperture is 8 mm and has a Pierce-like angle of β ≃ 42° on its back side (facing the accelerator) for the chamfered cases. The top and bottom boundaries are periodic while all the others are of Dirichlet type. The PG is set at a given reference potential (0 V in our case) and the Left-Hand-Side (LHS) boundary voltage V_{LB} is adjusted in order to simulate the effect of a bias potential. V_{LB} = 0 V or −5 V in this work, which implies that a Debye sheath will form in front of the boundary. In the former case (V_{LB} = 0 V), a negative ion which escaped the PG surface without undergoing a collision will hence flow outside of the simulation domain, while the ones that did collide will be trapped. All negative ions are trapped inside the simulation domain when V_{LB} = –5 V. Negative ions are uniquely produced on the PG surface facing the plasma (we specifically want to assess the dynamics of negative ions which are produced on the electrode). We assumed a Maxwellian flux distribution function with a current density of j_{G} = 600 A/m^{2} and a temperature T_{n} = 1 eV in the model. The plasma is numerically sustained by re-injecting an electron-positive ion pair for each positive ion lost on the walls of the simulation domain. Particles are re-injected on the LHS of the domain between x = 2 and 4 mm and the electron temperature is maintained by replacing the macroparticle velocity by a new one sampled from a Maxwellian distribution at the preset temperature T_{e} = 2 eV. The physical chemistry is simplified (Table I). We only consider negative hydrogen ions, H2+ and electrons. We implemented a background gas density n_{H2}=4×10^{19}m^{−3}, temperature T_{H2}=0.1eV, and an atomic hydrogen density of n_{H} = 10^{19} m^{−3} with T_{H} = 1 eV, respectively. These parameters are derived from measurements on fusion-type negative ion source prototypes [19]. The positive ion temperature is T_{p} = 2 eV. The magnetic filter field profile is assumed constant with B_{z} = 75 G and the cusp field from the suppression magnets B_{D} is derived from an analytical formulation
where x_{R} = 3.2 cm is the position of the center of the magnets in the extraction grid (EG), d = 1.6 cm is the distance between magnet bars, and lastly we suppose that B_{0} = 600 G.
In this work, we compare the negative ion beam characteristics versus the plasma density and extraction voltage. In order to do so, one needs to re-scale the cross-sections for the Coulomb collisions (reaction #1 of Table I). Another approach, which is equivalent, is to scale the vacuum permittivity ε_{0} instead of the plasma density. In that case, the physical-chemistry is not modified. A detailed discussion on the matter may be found in Ref [16].
III. EXTRACTION OF A POSITIVE ION BEAM
In this section, we study the extraction of positive ions versus the plasma density. Negative ions are not implemented. Figure 2 shows the positive ion current density profile in the XY plane for an average plasma density of n_{a} = 4.7 × 10^{15} m^{−3} (a) and a density sixteen times larger, n_{b} = 7.5 × 10^{16} m^{−3} in (b). The aperture is a slit and the calculation is performed with a 2D PIC-MCC model. The numerical resolution is Δx_{i}/λ_{De} ≃ 0.8 and the number of grid nodes is hence either 256 × 128 (length × height) for the conditions of Fig. 2(a) or 1024 × 512 in (b). Δx_{i} is the mesh size and λ_{De} is the electron Debye length. The number of particles per cell (ppc) is 40 on average and the time step Δt = 0.3Δx_{i}/v_{th} (ω_{p}Δt ≃ 0.2), where v_{th} is the thermal velocity of the electrons. Poisson's equation is solved iteratively with a multi-grid solver [16]. The physical-chemistry is restricted to reactions #1 and 2 of Table I.
The positive ion flux at the edge of the plasma meniscus (interface between the plasma and the vacuum of the electrostatic accelerator), in Fig. 2, is Γ_{p} = n_{s}u_{B}, where n_{s} and u_{B} = (eT_{e}/m_{i})^{1∕2} are, respectively, the plasma density at the sheath edge and the Bohm velocity. The electron temperature results from the equilibrium (assuming steady-state conditions) between the generation of particles through ionization inside the ion source and losses onto its walls and is hence associated with the geometry of the device for a given value of the background gas density [16]. The Bohm velocity is consequently independent of the plasma density and the positive ion flux at the meniscus scales with the plasma density. The current density profiles are nearly identical in Fig. 2. The extracted positive ion beam is space charge limited and in order to get the same curvature radius r_{c} for the plasma meniscus (white solid lines in Fig. 2) between the two cases the extraction voltage V_{EG} must be scaled according to the Child-Langmuir law. For a slit aperture, we find [20]
where I_{p} is the current, d is the distance between the extraction electrode and the plasma boundary (which usually differs from the inter-electrode length), S_{m} isthe surface area of the plasma meniscus, e is the elementary charge, ε_{0} is the vacuum permittivity, and m_{p} is the mass of a hydrogen molecular ion H2+. The meniscus shape is posited to be circular with a (curvature) radius r_{c} centered on the aperture symmetry axis (see Fig. 1). S_{m} = 2θr_{c} with a the slit diameter and sinθ=a/(2r_{c}).
The shape of the menicus adapts such that the ion current at the sheath edge and the space charge limited current inside the accelerator are identical [21]. Equation (3) assumes that r_{c}/d is large and was derived for two concentric cylinders of curvature radii r_{1} > r_{2} with d = r_{1} – r_{2}. In our case, r_{1} and r_{2} correspond to r_{c} and the curvature radius of the extraction grid (which is roughly approximated as infinite). Cylindrical symmetry was assumed for the beam and consequently there is no transverse space charge effect. Equation (3) may hence estimate the positive ion current extracted from a plasma source as long as the space charge force does not significantly increase the transverse divergence of the beam. For the conditions of Fig. 2(a), that is, an extraction voltage V_{a} = –200 V, d ≃ 4 mm, a = 8 mm, and r_{c}/d ≫ 1, we find I_{p} ≃ 56 mA/m which is similar to the current derived from the Child-Langmuir law [Eq. (3)]. The extraction voltage for the higher plasma density [Fig. 2(b)] is calculated using Eq. (3)
where r_{c} is the same in both cases. The ratio I_{b}/I_{a} = n_{b}/n_{a} = 16 and hence V_{b} ≃ –1270 V.
Figure 3 shows the perveance of the positive ion beam current
versus the scale extraction voltage (n/n0){2/3}V_{EG} for the same plasma densities of Fig. 2, that is, n_{a} = n_{0}/16 and n_{b} = n_{0} with n_{0} = 7.5 × 10^{16} m^{−3}, respectively. The analytical expression for the perveance, Eqs. (3) and (5), is independent of the plasma density. This is confirmed numerically in Fig. 3. For a given value of the scaled extraction potential (n/n0){2/3}V_{EG}, one finds correspondingly the same beam current density profile (and identical meniscus curvature radius). This means that one can describe the evolution of the positive ion beam profile with a numerical model assuming a lower plasma density, which is crucial for PIC-MCC algorithms as it greatly shortens the duration of the simulation in time. The calculation will be accurate as long as the electron Debye length remains sufficiently small with respect to the size of the aperture. P ≃ 20 μA/V^{3∕2}/m for the laminar beam profile of Fig. 2 with (n/n_{0})^{2∕3}V_{EG} = –1270 V.
Figure 4 shows the positive ion current density profile versus the extraction voltage for a plasma density of n_{a} = 4.7 × 10^{15} m^{−3} (n_{a} = n_{0}/16). The voltage is, respectively, V_{EG} = −400 V in (a) and −800 V in (b). The positive ion current density at the sheath edge is constant and the shape of the meniscus becomes increasingly more convex (i.e., with a larger surface area) for a greater extraction voltage in order to enforce the equality between the plasma current and the space charge limited current of the beam. As a result, both the distance d between the meniscus and the extraction grid and the ratio d/r_{c} increases while S_{m}/d^{2} decreases and hence the perveance decreases as well for a larger extraction voltage, as shown in Fig. 3. This is consistent with the estimates of Eq. (3). Note that the extraction of positive ions from an aperture with a square geometry generates aberrations at the edges of the beam. The latter may be cancelled by a chamfered aperture (the electrode lens effect is reduced near the edges). This is shown in Fig. 5. The aperture is chamfered with a Pierce-like angle β ≃ 42° facing the accelerator in this example.
IV. EXTRACTION OF A NEGATIVE ION BEAM FROM A SLIT APERTURE
A. Beam perveance versus the plasma density and extraction voltage
In ion sources for fusion applications, negative ions are generated either inside the device volume via physical-chemistry processes (vibrational excitation of the hydrogen molecules by electrons impacts and dissociation of the latter) or through collisions between a neutral atom or a positive ion with the metallic wall surfaces. Production of negative ions on the ion source walls needs the addition of cesium in order to lower the work function of the metal and hence increase the probability to transfer an electron to the incoming neutral by a tunneling process (two in the case of a positive ion). The negative ion flux on the plasma grid (PG) is typically space charge limited and as a result there is a virtual cathode in front of the grid (equivalent to a potential well for the positive charges with a kinetic energy lower than the well depth). The flux is estimated to be on the order of j_{n} = 600 A/m^{2} for the ITER prototypes [4,22]. The negative ion space charge is modulated mostly by the positive ion flux incoming from the plasma in the model (which may completely cancel out the virtual cathode). The electron density is typically much smaller than the positive ion density near the PG. In addition, the positive ion flux profile on the PG is strongly correlated with the curvature radius of the plasma meniscus and hence with the extraction voltage. The latter is damped inside the plasma by the charged particle screening capabilities. The Debye screening, which is a function of the plasma density (the width of the plasma sheath is larger for a lower density), impacts the penetration depth of the external potential and hence the charged particle trajectories in the vicinity of an aperture. The extraction voltage deflects the positive ions sideways (i.e., like an electrostatic lens). As a consequence, the space charge limited negative ion current which may escape the PG surface is also correlated with the extraction voltage. The overall effect is that the extracted negative ion current is not proportional to the magnitude of the plasma density (contrary to a positive ion beam).
Figure 6 shows the negative ion beam perveance P=I_{n}/VEG3/2 (Child-Langmuir law) derived from a 2D PIC-MCC calculation assuming a Dirichlet type boundary condition on the LHS with either V_{LB} = 0 V (a) or V_{LB} = –5 V in (b). The aperture is a rectangular slit. A plasma sheath is formed in the vicinity of the boundary and with a bias voltage of –5 V, the potential difference between the wall and the quasi-neutral plasma is sufficiently large to trap all the negative ions inside the simulation domain. In the second example (V_{LB} = 0 V), both the PG and the LHS boundary are at the same potential. Negative ions which are formed on the PG may hence flow across the left side uniquely when the particles have not undergone a collision with the background gas or neutral atoms (Table I). The average plasma density in Fig. 6 is, respectively, n = n_{0}/64 (red solid line), n = n_{0}/16 (black), n = n_{0}/4 (grey), and n = n_{0} (blue) with n_{0} = 3 × 10^{17} m^{−3}. The spatial resolution in the model is Δx_{i}/λ_{De} ≃ 0.8, time step Δt = 0.3Δx_{i}/v_{th} (ω_{p}Δt ≃ 0.2), and 40 ppc on average. The number of grid nodes is (n/n_{0})(2048 × 1024). The beam perveance in Fig. 6 is found practically invariant with respect to the simulated plasma density n provided that the extraction voltage V_{EG} is scaled by a factor α(n/n_{0})^{2∕3}, where n_{0} is a given density of reference. The beam perveance scan without any scaling is shown in Fig. 7. α is a correcting factor to the plasma density ratio (n/n_{0}) and in the case of Fig. 6 is well fitted by α(n)=α0k, where α_{0} ≃ 1.17 and k=log(n_{0}/n)/log(4) (base 4 logarithm). α must be calculated numerically. In practice, one needs to calculate the perveance at a given plasma density for a set of extraction voltages (a few data points are sufficient) and one point at a higher density. The Debye length must remain small compared to the aperture diameter. The computational cost compared to performing a PIC simulation at the real plasma density is significantly reduced.
B. Negative ion beam profile on the extraction grid
There is a also a qualitative correspondence between the perveance and the beam profile on the extraction grid (EG) independent of the value of the simulated plasma density, as shown in Fig. 8. The average plasma density is, respectively, n = n_{0}/64 (red solid line), n = n_{0}/16 (black), n = n_{0}/4 (grey), and n = n_{0} (blue) with n_{0} = 3 × 10^{17} m^{−3}. V_{LB} = 0 V. The scaled extraction potential is α(n/n_{0})^{2∕3}V_{EG} ≃ 1.8 kV in (a) corresponding to a perveance P ≃ 6 μA/V^{3∕2}/m. The curvature radius of the plasma meniscus is large in this case (r_{c}/a ≫ 1 where a is the diameter of the slit). The perveance is down as P ∼2 μA/V^{3∕2}/m for a scaled potential α(n/n_{0})^{2∕3}V_{EG} = 3.6 kV in (b). The concavity of the meniscus increased significantly (r_{c} ∼ a/2) and there are aberrations on the beam profile (a subset of negative ions with a large transverse energy). The curvature radius of the plasma meniscus is derived numerically from the penetration depth of the plasma boundary into the plasma volume s=r_{c}(1−cosθ) (distance between the meniscus and the front side of the plasma grid, facing the plasma), where sinθ=a/(2r_{c}). The evolution of the beam profile versus the extraction potential is hence qualitatively well described by low density calculations, as shown both in Figs. 8 and 9. The latter plots the 2 D negative ion current density profile for a scaled extraction voltage of α(n/n0){2/3}V_{EG}=1.8kV and, respectively, a plasma density n = n_{0}/16 in (a) and n = n_{0} in (b) with n_{0} = 3 × 10^{17} m^{−3}.
C. Aberrations
Aberrations could be cancelled out in a positive ion beam by using a chamfered aperture as shown in Fig. 5. This seems not to be the case for negative ions. Figure 10 plots the negative ion current density profile for the conditions of Fig. 8(b) that is n = n_{0}/64 and α(n/n0){2/3}V_{EG}=3.6kV (V_{EG} = 400 V). The meniscus is highlighted in white (boundary for the quasi-neutrality). The aberrations remain beside the use of a chamfered slit aperture (same Pierce-like angle of β ≃ 42° as in Fig. 5). This is due to a direct extraction of some of the negative ions by the EG voltage. This sub-population of particles are not inside the quasi-neutral plasma. The transverse electric field inside the plasma (behind the meniscus) is significantly lower and hence the negative ions extracted from the plasma are better collimated. Note that the onset of aberrations occurs for the same perveance, P_{A} ∼ 2.5 μA/V^{3∕2}/m, respectively, for the conditions of Figs. 6(a) and 6(b) which could indicate that the perveance depends mostly on the shape of the extractor (aperture radius and length of both the plasma and the extraction grid) provided that the plasma potential is not significantly altered by the extraction voltage. The perveance can be measured experimentally and might hence be used together with the model to assess the occurrence of aberrations in the beam. This question should be addressed in future work.
V. EXTRACTION OF NEGATIVE IONS FROM A CYLINDRICAL APERTURE
In this section, we analyse the evolution of the negative ion beam profile versus the extraction potential. The negative ions are extracted through a cylindrical aperture of radius r_{a} = 4 mm (the hole radius is constant, i.e., the grid is not chamfered in this example). The model is a 3 D PIC-MCC algorithm with a spatial resolution Δx_{i}/λ_{De} ≃ 0.8 (Δx_{i} = 125 μm) and a time step Δt = 0.3Δx_{i}/v_{th} (ω_{p}Δt ≃ 0.2). The number of grid nodes is 256 × 96^{2} (length × width × height) with 20 ppc on average and the average plasma density is n ≃ 4.7 × 10^{15} m^{−3}.
Figure 11 shows the negative ion beam profile on the extraction grid (first grid of the accelerator) versus the extraction voltage. The beam is approximately laminar for V_{EG} = 200 V and the onset of aberrations appears for a potential of 800 V. The meniscus curvature radius is large in the former case, r_{c}/r_{a} ≫ 1 while in the latter, we find r_{c}/r_{a} ∼1 (r_{c}/r_{a} ≃ 2 for V_{EG} = 400 V). These results are consistent with the threshold for the appearance of aberrations in the case of slit apertures. The corresponding value for the perveance is P_{A} ≃ 7 nA/V^{3∕2} (for one aperture).
VI. DISCUSSION
A. Origin of the aberrations
In this work, we discussed the generation of aberrations in the negative ion beam by an exceedingly high extraction voltage, which as a result, induces a plasma meniscus with a large concavity. These aberrations cannot be cancelled out by a chamfered grid aperture as in the case of positive ions (Sec. III). Note that the aperture was chamfered on the side facing the accelerator in the examples of Figs. 5 and 10. Aberrations in the negative ion beam profile have also been observed for apertures chamfered on both sides [23,24]. Another possible mechanism for the production of a halo in the beam may originate as a byproduct of the bombardment of neutral atoms (hydrogen or deuterium in the case of fusion-type negative ion sources) inside the aperture or on the back side of the grid (facing the accelerator) when the latter is chamfered. This implies that cesium, which lowers the work function of the plasma grid metallic surface, may migrate outside of the ion source, through the aperture [25]. The question of which of these two effects is the most relevant to the generation of a beam halo is left to future work.
B. Co-extraction of electrons
Electrons are strongly magnetized (while negative ions are only slightly scattered by the magnetic field) and hence both the extraction potential and the amplitude of the magnetic field are important parameters to describe the co-extraction of electrons from a fusion-type ion source. The magnetic field near the aperture has the shape of a cusp, acting as a barrier for the electrons. Several mechanisms may transport electrons across the aperture:
• Electrons may be directly extracted by the electric field, migrating toward the aperture through elastic and inelastic collision processes until their Larmor radii become sufficiently large (say on the order of the aperture diameter) to have a trajectory mostly driven by the electric field. This is likely the dominant effect for slit apertures although some instabilities may occur.
• In the case of cylindrical apertures, some additional E × B drift, where E is the electric field in the vicinity of the plasma meniscus, may further enhance the extracted electron current.
The question of the transport of electrons across the aperture is left to future work.
VII. CONCLUSION
The transport properties of negative ions produced on the surface of an extraction electrode (separating an ion source plasma from a particle accelerator) may be described by a numerical model simulating a lower plasma density without any loss of generality. A given value of the extracted beam perveance P = I/V^{3∕2} (Child-Langmuir law), where V is the potential of the first grid of the accelerator, describes qualitatively well both the shape of the beam on the extraction grid and the curvature radius of the plasma meniscus independent of the amplitude of the simulated plasma density (no scaling factor is hence required). The onset of aberrations is observed for a meniscus curvature radius on the order of the radius of the aperture. The corresponding perveance could in principal be an experimental indicator. The amplitude of the extracted ion beam current for any value of the plasma density may be recovered by scaling the extraction potential. The scaling factor must be calculated numerically for negative ions. In practice, one needs to calculate the perveance at a given plasma density (the Debye length must remain small compared to the aperture diameter) for a couple of extraction voltages and one point at a higher density. Both simulated plasma densities may be significantly lower than the real plasma density in the problem. The scaling factor seems to depend mostly on the geometry of the aperture when the plasma properties are not significantly altered by the amplitude of the extraction potential, although more work is necessary to provide a definite conclusion on that matter.
The approach described in this work shows that it may not be necessary to model the actual plasma density of an ion source with a 3 D PIC-MCC algorithm to derive a comprehensive description of the negative ion beam dynamics versus the extraction voltage. The numerical burden of solving the electron Debye length (which considerably lengthens the CPU time required for the model to converge) can hence be decoupled from the properties of the negative ion beam. Lastly, this model does not describe the co-extraction of electrons. This is left to future work.

FIG. 1. 
Schematic view of the simulation domain. The model is a zoom around one aperture (either slit or cylindrical geometries). The size of the simulation box is, respectively, 3.2 × 1.6 cm^{2} (length × height) in 2D and 3.2 × 1.2^{2} cm^{3} in 3D. The diameter of the aperture is a = 8 mm. B_{D} is the deflection magnetic field generated by permanent magnets embedded into the extraction grid (EG) (located at x = 3.2 cm). B_{F} = 75 G is the magnetic filter field, which was assumed constant. The plasma is generated self-consistently inside the region highlighted in grey. Each positive ion lost against the metallic surfaces (red and black solid lines, which are the Dirichlet boundary conditions) is replaced by an electron-ion pair inside the grey area. The electron temperature is also maintained there (the distribution function is assumed Maxwellian). Negative ions are only produced on the plasma grid (red color) wall facing the plasma in the model (x ≃ 2.6 cm). The slit aperture has either a rectangular (length × height of 2 × 4 mm) or a chamfered geometry (the latter is defined by the angle β). Lastly, V_{LB} is a fixed voltage and r_{c} is the curvature radius of the plasma meniscus (green solid line).
FIG. 2. 
Positive ion current density profile. The aperture is a rectangular slit. The plasma density is, respectively, n_{a} = n_{0}/16 in (a) and n_{b} = n_{0} in (b) with n_{0} = 7.5 × 10^{16} m^{−3}. The plasma meniscus is highlighted in white (0 V equipotential line). Lastly, the potential on the extraction grid (see Fig. 1) is V_{a} = (n_{a}/n_{b})^{2∕3}V_{b} = –200 V in (a) and V_{b} = –1270 V in (b).
FIG. 3. 
Perveance P=I_{p}/VEG3/2 of the positive ion beam versus the extraction voltage. The latter is normalized with respect to the plasma density scaling factor n/n_{0} (n_{0} = 7.5 × 10^{16} m^{−3}). The beam profiles on the extraction grid (and plasma meniscus curvature radii) are nearly identical for a given value of the perveance.
FIG. 4. 
Positive ion current density profile versus the extraction potential. The potential is, respectively, V_{EG} = –400 V in (a) and V_{EG} = –800 V in (b). The average plasma density is n_{a} = n_{0}/16 with n_{0} = 7.5 × 10^{16} m^{−3}. The plasma meniscus is highlighted in white. The aperture is a rectangular slit (2D PIC-MCC model).
FIG. 5. 
Positive ion current density profile on the extraction grid (EG) for both a rectangular and a chamfered slit aperture. The latter has a Pierce-like angle of β ≃ 42° (see Fig. 1) facing the accelerator. The extraction potential is V_{EG} = –400 V and the plasma density n = 4.7 × 10^{15} m^{−3} (n = n_{0}/16).
FIG. 6. 
Perveance P=I_{n}/VEG3/2 of the negative ion beam versus the extraction voltage. The average plasma density in the model is, respectively, n = n_{0}/64 (black solid line), n = n_{0}/16 (grey), n = n_{0}/4 (blue), and n = n_{0} (red) with n_{0} = 3 × 10^{17} m^{−3}. Both the beam profiles on the extraction grid and the plasma meniscus curvature radii are similar for a given value of the perveance. The extraction potential V_{EG} is scaled by α(n/n_{0})^{2∕3}, where α is a correcting factor. The best fit in this example is found for α(n)=α0k where α_{0} ≃ 1.17 and k=log(n_{0}/n)/log(4). The LHS potential (Fig. 1) is set to V_{LB} = 0 V in (a) and –5 V in (b).
FIG. 7. 
Same conditions as in Fig. 6(a) except that the extraction voltage was not scaled. V_{EG} is the actual potential associated with each value of the plasma density n in the perveance scan. V_{LB} = 0 V.
FIG. 8. 
Negative ion beam profile on the extraction grid (EG). The average plasma density n is, respectively, n = n_{0}/64 (red solid line), n = n_{0}/16 (black), n = n_{0}/4 (grey), and n = n_{0} (blue) with n_{0} = 3 × 10^{17} m^{−3}. V_{LB} = 0 V. The scaled extraction potential is α(n/n_{0})^{2∕3}V_{EG} ≃ 1.8 kV in (a) and α(n/n_{0})^{2∕3}V_{EG} ≃ 3.6 kV in (b). The onset of aberrations in the beam occurs for a perveance P_{A} ∼2.5 μA/V^{3∕2}/m (see Fig. 6) and a meniscus curvature radius r_{c} ≃ a/2, where a is the slit diameter. Lastly, the grid aperture is a rectangular slit in this example (2 D PIC-MCC model).
FIG. 9. 
Negative ion current density profile. The average plasma density is, respectively, n = n_{0}/16 in (a) and n = n_{0} in (b) with n_{0} = 3 × 10^{17} m^{−3}. The beam perveance is P = 6 μA/V^{3∕2}/m. The extraction voltage is V_{EG} = 400 V in (a) and 1.8 kV in (b). The aperture is a rectangular slit.
FIG. 10. 
Negative ion current density profile. The average plasma density is n = n_{0}/64 with n_{0} = 3 × 10^{17} m^{−3}. The scaled extraction voltage is α(n/n_{0})^{2∕3}V_{EG} = 3.6 kV (i.e., V_{EG} = 400 V). The aperture is a chamfered slit with a Pierce-like angle β ≃ 42°. The numerical model is a 2 D PIC-MCC.
FIG. 11. 
Negative ion beam profile on the extraction grid (EG) versus the extraction voltage. The aperture is a cylinder of radius r_{a} = 4 mm. The average plasma density is n ≃ 4.5 × 10^{15} m^{−3}. The LHS Dirichlet boundary condition is set to V_{LB} = 0 V and the extraction voltage is, respectively, V_{EG} = 200 V (black solid line), 400 V (grey) and, lastly, 800 V (blue). The onset of aberrations in the beam occurs for a perveance P_{A} ∼7 nA/V^{3∕2} (per aperture) and a meniscus curvature radius r_{c}/r_{a} ∼1, where r_{a} is the grid aperture radius. The numerical model is a 3 D PIC-MCC.
