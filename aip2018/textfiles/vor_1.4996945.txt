Dependence of square cylinder wake on Reynolds number
The wake of a square cylinder is investigated for Reynolds number Re < 10^{7}. Two-dimensional (2D) laminar simulation and three-dimensional (3D) large-eddy simulation are conducted at Re ≤ 1.0 × 10^{3}, while experiments of hotwire, particle image velocimetry, and force measurements are carried out at a higher Re range of 1.0 × 10^{3} < Re < 4.5 × 10^{4}. Furthermore, data covering a wide Re range, from 10^{0} to 10^{7}, in the literature are comprehensively collected for discussion and comparison purposes. The dependence on Re of the recirculation bubble size or vortex formation length, wake width, shear-layer transition, time-mean drag force, and Strouhal number is discussed in detail, revealing five flow regimes, each having distinct variations of the above parameters. With increasing Re, while the streamwise recirculation size enlarges at Re < 50 (steady flow regime), the vortex formation length reduces at 50 < Re < 1.6 × 10^{2} (laminar flow regime), remains unchanged at 1.6 × 10^{2} < Re < 2.2 × 10^{2} (2D-to-3D transition flow regime), and decreases at 2.2 × 10^{2} < Re < 1 × 10^{3} (shear layer transition I regime), approaching asymptotically a constant at Re > 1.0 × 10^{3} (shear layer transition II regime). Meanwhile, the wake width decreases with Re in the laminar flow regime, grows in 2D-to-3D transition and shear layer transition I regimes, and levels off in the shear layer transition II regime. The narrowest wake width is identified in the 2D-to-3D transition flow regime, corresponding to a minimum time-mean drag force and a largest Strouhal number. With increasing Re, the shear-layer transition length rapidly declines in the shear layer transition I regime where the transition occurs downstream of the trailing corner of the cylinder. On the other hand, it slowly tapers off in the shear layer transition II regime where the transition takes place upstream of the trailing corner. An extensive comparison is made between the dependence on Re of a circular cylinder wake and a square cylinder wake, with their distinct natures highlighted.
I. INTRODUCTION
Bluff-bodies are widely seen in practical engineering applications such as high-rise buildings, bridge piers, heat exchangers, and offshore platforms. The flow past a bluff body involves boundary-layer development, flow separation, shear-layer instability and transition, vortex shedding, vortex dynamics, and so on [1]. Due to the relative simplicity and prevalent occurrence in engineering applications, a slender cylinder with either circular or square cross section has been considered as the basic and representative model for the bluff-bodies. The former is featured by its cross section with a continuous and finite curvature, where the flow separation point is oscillatory and may occur over a segment of the surface. On the contrary, the latter has a cross section with sharp corners of an infinite curvature, where the flow separation location is stationary. The difference in the nature of the flow separation results in significantly distinct features of the flow structures and fluid forces between the circular and square cylinder cases [2–5]. However, compared with that around the circular cylinder, the flow around the square cylinder has received less attention in the literature [1,6].
With increasing Reynolds number Re (=U_{∞}D/ν, where U_{∞} is the incoming free stream velocity, D is the cylinder diameter or width, and ν denotes the kinematic viscosity of fluid), the wake of a circular cylinder behaves distinctively due to occurrences of different instabilities, change in the flow separation, shift in transition position, etc. Consequently, changes crop up in time-mean and fluctuating fluid forces, shear layer characteristics, vortex dynamics, and wake structures [1,7–9]. At Re < ∼50, the flow around a circular cylinder is laminar and steady, with a pair of recirculation bubbles symmetrically generated directly downstream of the cylinder. Laminar vortex shedding is detected at 50 < Re < 200, yielding a von Kármán vortex street of alternating opposite-sign vortices. With an increase in Re in this regime, the vortex formation length drops, and the Strouhal number (St = f_{s}D/U_{∞}, where f_{s} is the vortex shedding frequency) increases. The cylinder wake changes from two-dimensional (2D) to three-dimensional (3D) in a transition Re ≈ 200–260. The three-dimensionality in the wake, together with the formation length and St, is further enhanced as Re increases from 260 to 10^{3}. At 1.0 × 10^{3} < Re < 2.0 × 10^{5}, the transition to turbulence in the shear layer occurs, resulting in reductions in the formation length and St. Although different features in the cylinder wake are highlighted, the time-mean drag is more or less constant in this Re range [10]. A critical regime is identified at 2.0 × 10^{5} < Re < 4.0 × 10^{5} where the transition in the shear layer approaches the separation, the time-mean drag plunges, St jumps, and separation bubble forms on the cylinder surface. The separation bubble bursts, and the transition to turbulence occurs in the boundary layer at Re > 4.0 × 10^{5}, i.e., post-critical regime. The characteristics of the flow at different Re ranges are very crucial. Without this information, it is very difficult to analyze and understand the wake of two or more cylinders [11,12].
Similar to that of the circular cylinder, the wake structure of a square cylinder exhibits distinct characteristics with increasing Re. When Re > 50 [13], the flow around the square cylinder is unsteady, characterized by alternating vortex shedding and a von Kármán vortex street. The unsteady flow separates from the trailing corners of the square cylinder at Re < 120 but from the leading corners at Re > 120 [14,15]. The flow remains laminar as Re is lower than a critical Reynolds number Re_{c1} = 150–200 depending on the freestream turbulence intensity, blockage ratio, cylinder aspect ratio, etc [14,16–18]. At this Re_{c1}, the so-called mode A instability and the transition from 2D to 3D flows occur [18]. Mode A is featured by spanwise vortex dislocation, streamwise vortex loops, and a relatively large spanwise wavelength (around 5.2D) of the streamwise vortices [17,18].St increases with Re (<Re_{c1}) [19–21]. With a further increase in Re, the so-called mode B instability is identified at another critical Reynolds number Re_{c2} = 190–250 [14,16–18], which is again dependent on the factors such as turbulence intensity, blockage, and aspect ratio. A reduced St was observed in the transition regime at Re_{c1} < Re < Re_{c2}. In mode B, the spanwise wavelength of the streamwise vortices is much smaller, around 1.2D, than that in mode A [17,18]. In addition, Robichaux et_al [14] based on the Floquet instability analysis observed a third mode S at Re ≈ 200. Mode S has a spanwise wavelength of around 2.8D and a shedding period twice that of the base flow.
The flow around the square cylinder becomes turbulent at Re > Re_{c2} and has been extensively investigated both experimentally and numerically. The behavior of the separated shear layers and ensuing recirculation region above the side surface of the square cylinder was studied by Lyn and Rodi (Re = 2.14 × 10^{4}) [22], Brun et_al (Re = 2.0 × 10^{4}–3.0 × 10^{5}) [23], and Minguez et_al (Re = 2.14 × 10^{4}) [24] using laser-Doppler velocimetry; by Brun et_al (Re = 5.0 × 10^{2}–2.0 × 10^{3}) [23], Minguez et_al (Re = 2.14 × 10^{4}) [24], and Cao and Tamura (Re = 2.2 × 10^{4}) [25] using large eddy simulation (LES); and by Trias et_al (Re = 2.2 × 10^{4}) [26] using direct numerical simulation (DNS). Both the large-scale von Kármán vortex street in the near wake and small-scale Kevin-Helmholtz vortical structures in the separating shear layers were well captured in these investigations, either based on flow visualizations or energy spectra of point-wise velocities. Brun et_al [23] and Minguez et_al [24] also observed the occurrence of Kevin-Helmholtz vortex pairing in the shear layer from the leading corners. Furthermore, Lyn et_al (Re = 2.14 × 10^{4}) [27], Saha et_al (Re = 8.7 × 10^{3} and 1.8 × 10^{4}) [28], and Sohankar (Re = 1.0 × 10^{3}–5.0 × 10^{6}) [29] investigated the near-wake structures, including their phase- and time-averaged characteristics, downstream evolutions, and Reynolds stress distribution. St declines gradually at Re_{c2} < Re < 8.0 × 10^{3} and then levels off with increasing Re [21,23,29].
Fluid forces acting on the square cylinder largely vary when Re is changed, in view of the internal coherence between the flow structures and fluid forces. In the laminar regime (i.e., at Re < Re_{c1}), time-mean drag coefficient C¯{d} exponentially declines with Re [13,15,19]. In the turbulent regime (Re > Re_{c2}), C¯{d} however progressively increases at Re_{c2} < Re < 2 × 10^{4} [20], asymptotically approaching a constant at Re > 2.0 × 10^{4} [29]. Meanwhile, fluctuating lift force can be measured as the flow becomes unsteady at Re ≥ 50, increasing with Re at 50 < Re < 2.0 × 10^{4} [15,29] and remaining almost constant at Re > 2.0 × 10^{4} [29]. Fluctuating drag force exhibits similar behavior to that of the fluctuating lift [29].
While Re-dependent intrinsic features of a circular cylinder wake are well documented, there has been no systematic investigation on those of a square cylinder, including vortex formation length, wake width, and shear-layer transition length, as well as on the correlation between these parameters and the fluid forces. This work aims to investigate the near wake of a square cylinder for Re < 10^{7}, based on our numerical simulations and experimental measurements (at Re = 60–4.5 × 10^{4}) as well as published data from the literature. Due to the limitation of the wind tunnel, the numerical simulation is done for Re = 60–10^{3}. Typical flow structures and wake characteristic parameters of the square cylinder are discussed in detail and compared extensively with those of the circular cylinder. Sections II and III present the details of numerical simulations and experimental measurements, respectively. Results and discussion are given in Sec. IV. This work is summarized in Sec. V.
II. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS
A. Laminar simulation
Two-dimensional (2D) simulations are conducted for the unsteady laminar flow around a square cylinder at Re = 60, 100, and 120. The 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations are solved on structural quadrilateral grids using the finite-volume method (FVM) in ANSYS Fluent. The continuity and N-S equations governing the flow can be written, respectively, in the Einstein convention as follows:
where u_{i} are the velocity components along the corresponding Cartesian coordinates x_{i} (here, x_{1} and x_{2} denote the streamwise x- and cross-stream y-directions, respectively), p is the fluid pressure, ρ is the fluid density, and ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid.
The computational domain is a rectangle with the size of (Lxu+Lxd)×L_{y}=(12D+24D)×24D [cf. Fig. 1(a) and Table I], where Lxu and Lxd are the distance between the cylinder center and the upstream inlet and downstream outlet, respectively, L_{y} is the lateral distance, and D is the cylinder width. The domain parameters are similar to those used by Sohankar et_al [19] and larger than those used by Sharma and Eswaran [30]. See also the work of Zheng and Alam [31] for the effect of the computational domain on the cylinder wake. As shown in Fig. 1(a), quadrilateral meshes are generated in the computational domain. With the first grid nearest setting 0.01D away from the cylinder surface, the grids are stretched progressively with a factor of 1.02 along both the x- and y-directions. The total number of the grids is 45 600. A uniform streamwise velocity (i.e., U_{∞}) is imposed at the upstream inlet boundary, while a pressure-outlet boundary condition is used at the downstream outlet boundary. The no-slip condition is applied to the cylinder surface. The lateral sides are treated as slip sides using symmetric conditions.
The velocity-pressure coupling in the governing equations is based on the algorithm of semi-implicit method for pressure linked equations-consistent (SIMPLEC) [32]. The second-order and second-order upwind differencing schemes are applied for the spatial discretization of pressure and momentum, respectively. The temporal discretization is done using the second-order implicit differencing scheme. The computation is advanced by a non-dimensional time step Δt^{*} = ΔtU_{∞}/D = 0.01, yielding Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) numbers < 1 [33]. In this paper, the superscript “*” denotes normalization by D and/or U_{∞}, without otherwise specified. To calculate the statistics such as time-mean and root-mean-square (rms) values of the drag force, a sampling time of 20 vortex-shedding periods is adopted after the flow becomes statistically stationary.
B. Large-eddy simulation
Three-dimensional (3D) large-eddy simulations (LES) are conducted at Re ≥ 1.6 × 10^{2} (Table I). The three-dimensional N-S equations are solved on structural hexahedral grids using the FVM in ANSYS Fluent. The filtered continuity and N-S equations are given as follows:
where ū_{i} are the filtered velocity components along x_{i} (here, x_{1}, x_{2}, and x_{3} denote the streamwise x-, cross-stream y- and spanwise z-directions, respectively), p¯ is the filtered pressure, and τ_{ij} are the subgrid-scale stresses defined as τ_{ij}=u_{i}u_{j}¯−ū_{i}ū_{j}. The Smagorinsky-Lilly model is used presently, with the turbulent eddy viscosity modeled as ν_{t}=(CsΔ){2}2S¯{ij}S¯{ij}, where C_{s} is a constant, Δ is the cell volume, and S¯{ij}=12∂ū_{i}∂x_{j}+∂ū_{j}∂x_{i} is the rate-of-strain tensor. C_{s} = 0.1 for all the present simulations, as chosen for circular and square cylinder near-wakes, e.g., by Lin et_al [33,34]
The computational domain (cf. Fig. 1) is chosen to be (Lxu+Lxd)×L_{y}×L_{z} = (12D + 24D) × 24D × 10D for the cases of Re = 1.6 × 10^{2}–2.6 × 10^{2}, where the flow around a square cylinder is transitional and has a relatively large spanwise wavelength [14,16–18,20], and (Lxu+Lxd)×L_{y}×L_{z} = (8D + 16D) × 16D × 4D for the cases of Re = 5.0 × 10^{2} and 1.0 × 10^{3} [29,34]. The grid distribution in the x-y plane is similar to that of the 2D simulation [Fig. 1(a)], while it is uniform along the spanwise z-direction [Fig. 1(b)]. The nearest grid to the cylinder surface is 0.01D away, ensuring Y^{+} ≈ 1 as required by the computation of turbulent flows. The grids are refined with an increase in Re. The grid numbers are 45 600 × 72 and 62 000 × 48 for the cases of Re = 1.6 × 10^{2}–2.6 × 10^{2} and Re = 5.0 × 10^{2}–1.0 × 10^{3}, respectively (Table I). The average mesh size is 0.0189D in the xy-plane and 0.1389D in the spanwise z-direction at the lower Re range (Re = 1.6 × 10^{2}–2.6 × 10^{2}), while it is 0.0062D in the xy-plane and 0.0833D in the spanwise z-direction at the higher Re range (Re = 5.0 × 10^{2} and 10^{3}). The grid resolution [(0.0833–0.1389)D] along the spanwise z-direction is fine enough to capture the unsteady behavior in the spanwise z-direction as recommended by Mankbadi and Georgiadis [35]. The pressure outlet condition is used at the outlet boundary, and the no-slip condition is used over the cylinder surface. Symmetric conditions are used on the lateral sides, while the periodic condition is used along the spanwise direction. The initial condition used in our 3D LES is the imposition of a uniform flow U_{∞} with a turbulent intensity of 0.1%. The computational domain [(Lxu+Lxd)×L_{y}×L_{z} = (12D + 24D) × 24D × 10D] used in the present simulations is larger than that [(8.5D + 12.5D) × 18D × 6D and (6D + 18D) × 10D × 6D] used in the previous DNS work [16,20]. Saha et_al [16] and Sohankar et_al [20] examined the effect of L_{z} on the flow, varying L_{z} from 6D to 10D. The effect was found to be negligible. Therefore, L_{z} = 10D in our LES simulation is long enough to capture the mode A instability.
The Kolmogorov length scale l_{υ} = (ν^{3}/ε)^{1/4}, where ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid and ε is the energy dissipation rate defined by ε=urms3/L, where L is the characteristic length scale in the cylinder wake [36].l_{v} = (0.0078–0.0532)D, given the maximum u_{rms} = (0.4–0.65)U_{∞} and vortex formation length L_{f} = (2.1–1.0)D = L at the Re range of 1.6 × 10^{2}–10^{3}. On the other hand, the average mesh size is 0.0062D for Re = 5 × 10^{2} and 10^{3} and 0.0189D for Re = 1.6 × 10^{2}–2.6 × 10^{2} in the xy-plane, and 0.0833D for Re = 5 × 10^{2} and 10^{3} and 0.1389D for Re = 1.6 × 10^{2}–2.6 × 10^{2} along the spanwise z-direction. Therefore, the present mesh size can capture about 10 times the Kolmogorov length scale. The subgrid modeling in the present LES is correctly made for the small scales in the near wake of the square cylinder.
The algorithm of pressure implicit splitting of operators (PISO) is adopted for the velocity-pressure coupling. The second-order and bounded central differencing schemes are applied to the spatial discretization of pressure and momentum, respectively, while the bounded second-order implicit differencing scheme for the temporal discretization. The time step is Δt^{*} = 0.01, yielding sufficiently small CFL numbers <1 in the computational domain. The sampling time of 20 periods of vortex shedding is used for the calculation of statistics. More details on the LES of bluff-body near-wakes can be found in, e.g., the work of Lin et_al [33,34] Since the details of the numerical aspects in the present work are similar to those in our previous work on the square cylinder wake [31,34], the convergence analysis of the numerical simulations was not repeatedly conducted in the present work. As shown in Table II, the time-mean drag coefficient (C¯{d}) and Strouhal number (St) values at different Re from the present work are in good agreement with those from the literature. For example, C¯{d} = 1.46 and 1.94 at Re = 120 and 500, respectively, from the present work are comparable to those from the literature, i.e., C¯{d} = 1.4–1.47 at Re = 120 from the work of Yoon et_al [15] and Sharma and Eswaran [30] and C¯{d} = 1.87 at Re = 500 from the work of Sohakar et_al [20] The present St = 0.153 (Re = 120) and 0.125 (Re = 10^{3}) from simulations are very close to St = 0.155 (Re = 120) from the work of Sharma and Eswaran [30] and 0.123 (Re = 10^{3}) from the work of Okajima [21]. Furthermore, our previous LES work [34] on the near wake of a square cylinder was conducted at a relatively high Re = 2.2 × 10^{4}, overlapping the present experimental tests. C¯{d} and St from the work of Lin et_al [34] are 2.16 and 0.132, respectively, in good agreement with those (C¯{d} = 2.14 and St = 0.133) from the present experiments.
III. EXPERIMENTAL TESTS
Experiments of particle image velocimetry (PIV), hotwire, and force measurements are conducted in an open-loop wind tunnel, which has a test section of 0.3 m × 0.3 m × 1.5 m (width × height × length). The square cylinder model, made of aluminum, spans horizontally across the entire width of the test section. Three cylinder models of different widths (i.e., D = 5 mm, 15 mm, and 25 mm) are used. The cylinders of D = 5 mm and 15 mm are used for Re < 3.0 × 10^{4}, yielding the minimum aspect ratio of 20 and the maximum blockage of 5% in the test section. In order to enlarge Re to 4.45 × 10^{4}, the cylinder of D = 25 mm was employed, corresponding to aspect and blockage ratios of 12% and 8.3%, respectively. No blockage correction is performed for the obtained results. The oncoming velocity is changed from 3.6 m/s to 24 m/s in the tests, corresponding to Re = 1.4 × 10^{3}–4.45 × 10^{4}. The turbulent intensity for this range of velocity was less than 0.5% in the absence of the test model.
A Dantec PIV system (maximum triggering frequency is 727 Hz for double frames) is deployed to measure the instantaneous velocities in the xy-plane in the near wake of the square cylinder. Flow is seeded uniformly with olive oil particles of about 1 μm in diameter, generated from a smoke generator (TSI 9307-6). The flow is illuminated by two overlapping laser sheets from pulse lasers (Litron LDY 304-PIV, Nd: YLF). Each laser pulse lasts 10 ns and has a maximum energy output of 30 mJ. The repeating rate of the lasers is 300 Hz, and the interval between the two lasers is set to be 100 μs for Re = 1.4 × 10^{3}–6 × 10^{3} and 50 μs for Re > 6 × 10^{3}. A charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (Phantom V641, double frames, 2560 × 1600 pixels), placed perpendicular to the laser sheets, is used to capture the particle images. A Dantec Flowmap processor is employed to synchronize the laser illumination and image capturing. As shown in Fig. 2, the PIV measurement zone, located at the mid-span of the cylinder and symmetric about y = 0, has a size of 4D × 4D. There is a shaded area underneath the cylinder due to the shielding of the cylinder itself, as the illumination is from top to bottom. About 900 pairs of images are captured for each Re considered. The algorithm of cross correlation is adopted to calculate the velocity vectors, with an interrogation window of 32 × 32 pixels and 50% overlapping in both the directions. More details of the algorithm can be found in the work of Raffel et_al [37] The spatial resolution of the velocity vectors is 0.04D in both the directions, and the temporal resolution of velocity fields is 0.0033 s corresponding to the repeating rate of 300 Hz. The experimental uncertainty in determining velocities is estimated to be less than 3% for the present PIV system.
A single-wire hotwire probe (Dantec 55P01), mounted on a computer-controlled three-dimensional traverse mechanism, is used to measure the streamwise fluctuating velocity, u, in the near wake of the cylinder. Figure 2(a) illustrates the hotwire measurement zone (1.5D × 0.4D) residing right above the upper side of the cylinder. The domain (1.5D × 0.4D) was selected for identifying the transition point in the shear layer. The measurement zone is a grid with the resolutions of Δx/D = 0.02 and Δy/D = 0.016 in the x- and y-directions, respectively. The hotwire (Pt-10% Rh), having a diameter of 5 μm and a length of around 2 mm, is operated at a constant temperature mode with an over-heat ratio of 1.8. The hotwire signal is low-pass filtered and sampled at 1 kHz and 2–3 kHz (depending on Re), respectively, using a 16-channel analogue-to-digital (A/D) converter (NI PCI-6143). The sampling time lasts for 30–60 s (depending on Re) for each record, which is equivalent to 3700–5600 vortex-shedding cycles. The hotwire-measured u is visually inspected to determine the occurrence of shear layer transition. Moreover, the Strouhal number (St) is obtained from the power spectral density function E_{u} of u at x^{*} = 1.0, y^{*} = 0.9 which is done using a fast Fourier transform algorithm.
The time-mean drag force acting on the cylinder is measured using a load cell (Model no MN020-10N). As shown in Fig. 2(b), the cylinder model is horizontally cantilever-supported by a fixed frame placed outside of the tunnel. The free end of the cylinder is about 2 mm away from the tunnel wall. The load cell is tightly bolted in between two machine-polished steel blocks. To avoid effects of the tunnel vibration on the force measurements, the cylinder model and its support are detached from the wind tunnel wall. The natural frequency (f_{n}) of the test model is about 400 Hz in the present mounting. There is a large separation between f_{n} and the vortex-shedding frequency fs (=98–130 Hz), avoiding resonance and associated vibration. Calibration of the load cell is made in situ, which exhibits linearity between applied forces and output voltages in the load cell range tested (not shown). The load cell signal is low-pass filtered at 1.0 kHz and sampled at 2.5 kHz using a 16-channel A/D converter. The sampling period is 45 s for each run, corresponding to 4200–5600 vortex-shedding cycles.
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Typical flow structures
Figures 3–6 present the typical flow structures, in terms of instantaneous spanwise vorticity (ωz*) or vortical structures detected using the Q-criterion [38], in the near wake of the cylinder as Re varies from Re = 1.0 × 10^{2} to 1.0 × 10^{3}. The ωz*-distributions at Re = 1.0 × 10^{2} [Fig. 3(a)] are from the two-dimensional numerical simulation, while the ωz*-distributions and the Q-criterion-based vortical structures at Re = 1.6 × 10^{2}–1.0 × 10^{3} [Figs. 3(b)–3(d) and 4–6] are from the three-dimensional LES. The flow structures exhibit distinct features at different Re. To facilitate the following discussion, the flow structures are grouped into three flow regimes, namely, laminar flow regime (Fig. 3, Re ≤ 1.6 × 10^{2}), transition flow regime (Figs. 4 and 5, 1.6 × 10^{2} < Re < 2.6 × 10^{2}), and turbulent (or post-transition) flow regime (Fig. 6, Re ≥ 2.6 × 10^{2}).
In the laminar flow regime, the iso-contours of ωz* [Figs. 3(a) and 3(b)] display two sets of opposite sign vortices arranged in an alternating fashion, exhibiting a typical feature of a von Kármán vortex street. The two-dimensional nature of this flow or parallel shedding of spanwise vortices is manifested by the iso-surfaces of ωz* (=±0.35) [Fig. 3(c)] and of Q (=2) [Fig. 3(d)], which are uniform along the spanwise direction. A similar observation was made by Luo et_al [17] in a dye flow visualization test at Re = 1.2–1.5 × 10^{2}.
The transition from two-to three-dimensionality occurs in the near wake, with mode A instability appearing at the critical Re_{c1} = 1.5–2.0 × 10^{2} [14,16,17,20]. Williamson [1] for a circular cylinder wake observed that the mode A instability occurs at the first transition from two- to three-dimensionality. Streamwise vortices having a relatively large spanwise wavelength of (3–4)D are generated in the near wake of the circular cylinder. St drops as the two-dimensional (laminar) vortex shedding changes to the three-dimensional (turbulent) vortex shedding. Figure 4 presents the evolution of the vortical structures in the square cylinder wake at Re = 1.82 × 10^{2} to illustrate the development of mode A instability. At the time instant to* [Fig. 4(a)], the iso-surfaces display the staggered pattern of a von Kármán vortex street downstream, largely similar to that observed in Fig. 3(d) at Re = 1.6 × 10^{2}, indicating the laminar or parallel vortex shedding from the cylinder. However, a small waviness along the spanwise direction (e.g., vortex 1) is discernible at a certain distance downstream of the cylinder [Fig. 4(a)]. The presence of the waviness on the primary spanwise vortices causes the deformation of the vortex sheets, which is likely to be associated with the onset of mode A instability [18,39]. Subsequently, streamwise vortices of opposite sign are generated in an alternating pattern along the spanwise direction, as seen at time instant to* + 46 [Fig. 4(b)]. The spanwise vortical structures are further distorted, exhibiting irregular features along the spanwise direction. Notable deformation of the vortex sheet (of vortex 2) and shedding (of vortex 3) can now be seen. Initiated from the separated shear layers and associated with the primary spanwise vortices, the streamwise vortices grow in size and evolve downstream, as indicated by the sequential plots in Fig. 4. Vortex loops may be formed [e.g., Fig. 4(e)], but they are not self-sustaining rather decay subsequently after several vortex-shedding cycles. The spanwise wavelength of the streamwise vortices is around 5D [Fig. 4(f)], close to that (∼5.2D) observed by Luo et_al [17] in their experimental tests. The presence of streamwise vortices on both upper and lower sides of a primary vortex tube is regular, following the spanwise wavelength. Dislocations of the spanwise vortices were observed in the time histories of the streamwise fluctuating velocities measured by a single hotwire in the transition flow regime [17], which is possibly due to the phase variation of the large-scale coherent structures or to the merging of the secondary streamwise vortices in the spanwise direction [16]. Luo et_al [18] studied the flow around a square cylinder at Re = 50–4.0 × 10^{2}, focusing on the transition phenomenon in the near wake. The transition Re for the onset of mode A instability was found to be Re_{c1} = 1.6 × 10^{2}. The mode A had a spanwise wavelength of 5D, with the large-scale secondary vortices from the top and bottom being antiphase, which is consistent with the present observations. Park and Yang [40] noted the effects of rounding the sharp corners of the square cylinder on the instabilities in the near-wake.
With further increasing Re, the mode B instability occurs at the second transition of the circular cylinder wake where the spanwise wavelength of streamwise vortices reduces to (0.8–1)D and St jumps [1]. The critical Re for the onset of mode B instability in the square cylinder wake is Re_{c2} = 1.8–2.5 × 10^{2} [14,16,17,20]. Figure 5 presents the evolution of the vortical structures in the square cylinder wake at Re = 2.2 × 10^{2} to illustrate the development of mode B instability. At the time instant to* [Fig. 5(a)], the vortical structures exhibit typical features of mode A, i.e., the large-scale streamwise vortex loops having a relatively large spanwise wavelength (∼5D). Meanwhile, a deformation of the vortex sheet associated with delayed shedding from the cylinder can be observed in the separated shear layer. It seems that the deformation of the vortex sheet at this higher Re = 2.2 × 10^{2} [Fig. 5(a)] is much higher than that at the lower Re = 1.82 × 10^{2} [Figs. 4(b) and 4(c)]. As a result, more streamwise vortices are generated near the cylinders [Fig. 5(b)]. These newly generated streamwise vortices develop in size with time [Figs. 5(c) and 5(d)], leading to the mode B instability. The spanwise wavelength of these streamwise vortices is about 1.2D, consistent with that experimentally obtained by Luo et_al [17] The streamwise vortices are, however, less regular than those in mode A, perhaps due to the strong interactions with the primary spanwise vortices.
The critical Reynolds numbers associated with modes A and B for a circular cylinder, obtained by Williamson [7], are Re_{c1} ≈ 1.9 × 10^{2} and Re_{c2} = 2.3–2.6 × 10^{2}, respectively, which are higher than those for a square cylinder. However, as noted by Luo et_al [17], the vortical structures in modes A and B for a circular cylinder wake appear similar to those for a square cylinder wake, indicating similar generation mechanisms.
In the post-transition flow regime where mode B succeeds (Fig. 6), with increasing Re, (i) the regularity of the streamwise vortices degrades, (ii) the structure of spanwise vortices deteriorates, (iii) the streamwise separation between two successive spanwise vortices elongates, and (iv) the wake including spanwise and streamwise vortices becomes more turbulent.
B. Vortex formation length and wake width
It is important to quantify the vortex formation length (L_{f}) and wake width (W) of a bluff-body wake, in view of their close connections with the base pressure and thus the drag force acting on the bluff body [8,41]. The former is defined as the streamwise distance between the cylinder center and the shear layer rolling position identified as the point of the maximum (peak) streamwise fluctuating velocity (u_{rms}) in the wake [42], while the latter is defined as the transverse separation between the two peaks in the u_{rms}-contours [43]. Figure 7 presents u_{rms} contours at different Re, with the definitions of L_{f} and W [Fig. 7(a)]. Notably, the u_{rms}-contours exhibit distinct characteristics, dependent on Re. First, the streamwise location of the peaks shortens with increasing Re. It is internally connected to the shear layer transition, which will be discussed later. Second, the lateral separation between the two peaks decays between Re = 120 and 182 and then grows for Re > 182, which will be made clear later. Third, vorticity is distributed largely in the wake and less in the shear layers for Re ≤ 182 but is distributed both in the shear layers and wake for Re > 182. Fourth, a secondary peak is observed over the cylinder surface (x^{*} ≤ 0.5) at Re ≥ 5 × 10^{2} [Figs. 7(c)–7(f)], more conspicuous at Re = 5 × 10^{2} and 1.0 × 10^{3} [Figs. 7(c) and 7(d)] but less at Re = 1.4 × 10^{3} and 3.7 × 10^{3} [Figs. 7(e) and 7(f)]. The secondary peak is ascribed to the reattachment of shear layers on the side surfaces. Figure 8 shows instantaneous vorticity structures at different Re. Evidently, the shear layers pass over the cylinder at a low Re = 100 [Fig. 8(a)]. However, the reattachment of shear layers upon the trailing corner of the cylinder can be seen at Re = 5 × 10^{2} and 1 × 10^{3} [Figs. 8(b) and 8(c)]. When Re is increased, the reattachment shifting upstream occurs on the side surface [Fig. 8(d)]. The observation is consistent with the secondary peak appearing in u_{rms} contours [Figs. 7(c)–7(f)]. The u_{rms} magnitude decreases with increasing Re, as the reattachment location moves upstream, from the trailing corner to the side surface [Figs. 8(d)–8(f)]. The reattachment of the alternating shear layers upon the side surfaces of the cylinder is one of the reasons of the small u_{rms} magnitude [Fig. 7(f)].
In order to provide further evidence of the above information, the typical power spectral density functions of fluctuating lifts are presented in Fig. 9. Different from the Reynolds numbers in Figs. 7 and 8, a few additional Reynolds numbers are chosen for the results in Fig. 9. There is only one predominant peak at St = 0.146 in the power spectral density function at Re = 1.0 × 10^{2} [Fig. 9(a)], indicating the laminar vortex shedding [Fig. 8(a)]. However, two dominant peaks (St = 0.152 and 0.161) are identified in the power spectral density function at Re = 1.82 × 10^{2} [Fig. 9(b)]. The higher and lower Strouhal numbers correspond to the two-dimensional and three-dimensional flows, respectively. Again, a single peak is discernible at Re > 5.0 × 10^{2} [Figs. 9(c)–9(f)]. The peak is nevertheless strong, and the spectrum is very noisy at Re = 5.0 × 10^{2} [Fig. 9(c)], indicating an alternating shear-layer reattachment at the corner [Figs. 8(b) and 8(c)]. On the other hand, due to the reattachment on the side surface [Fig. 8(d)], the peak at Re > 1.5 × 10^{3} [Figs. 9(d)–9(f)] is less energetic and the power spectrum is less noisy. Indeed, an increase in Re causing a shift in the shear layer transition upstream makes the reattachment changing from the corner to the side surface. For Re ≥ 5.0 × 10^{2}, small peaks at 2St and/or 3St are discernible in Figs. 9(c) and 9(d) which are the signature of alternating reattachment of the shear layers on the trailing corner or side surface (depending on Re), as discussed earlier.
Figure 10 presents the dependence of Lf* on Re. Based on the spatial resolution (0.04D) in the PIV measurements at Re > 1.0 × 10^{3}, the uncertainty in Lf* is less than 2%. The streamwise length (Lr*) of the recirculation region is also included [15]. Furthermore, for a comparison purpose, Lf* for the circular cylinder wake, reproduced from the work of Zdravkovich [44] and Norberg [45], is incorporated. Lf* dips rapidly from 5 to 2.2 with increasing Re for 50 < Re < 1.6 × 10^{2}, as indicated by the least-squares fitted line Lf*=884.5Re^{−1.37}+1.27. Meanwhile, Lr* decreases with an increase in Re at 50 < Re < 1.6 × 10^{2} [14,15,30], echoing the present observations, a decreasing Lf* with increasing Re in this Re range (Fig. 10). Note that Lr* increases from 0.6 to 3.5 with increasing Re (<50), where the flow around the square cylinder is steady [14,15,30]. At 1.6 × 10^{2} < Re < 2.2 × 10^{2} (transition regime) where mode A occurs, Lf* stops dropping but fluctuates with Re (Fig. 10). The presence of longitudinal vortex loops initiated by the mode A instability plays a role in delaying the rolling of primary spanwise vortices [17], which results in Lf* not further reduced with increasing Re at the transition regime (Fig. 10). Robichaux et_al [14] noted an approximately constant length of the recirculation region at 1.6 × 10^{2} < Re < 2.2 × 10^{2}. At the upper limit of the transitional regime, the mode B instability takes place (Fig. 5). Sohankar et_al [20] observed an increased intensity of secondary vortices along with an enhanced intensity of the von Kármán vortices at 2.5 × 10^{2} < Re < 5.0 × 10^{2}. This may provide an explanation of why Lf* declines rapidly from 2.2 to 1.1 with increasing Re at 2.2 × 10^{2} < Re < 1.0 × 10^{3} where intermittent reattachment of the shear layer persists. At Re > 1.0 × 10^{3}, the turbulent wake of the square cylinder is fully developed and the shear layer reattachment is steady, where Lf* becoming less sensitive to Re reaches an asymptotic value, i.e., Lf* ≈ 1. The variation in Lf* with Re (>2.2 × 10^{2}) can be described by the power law of Lf*=8×10^{4}Re^{−2}+1.04 (Fig. 10).
Now a classification of the flow can be provided based on the variations in the flow structures and Lf* as well as Lr*. Here five flow regimes are identified, namely, steady flow (Re < 50), laminar wake (2D flow) with alternating shedding (50 < Re < 1.6 × 10^{2}), transition from two-to three-dimensionality (1.6 × 10^{2} < Re < 2.2 × 10^{2}), shear layer transition I (2.2 × 10^{2} < Re < 1.0 × 10^{3}, alternating reattachment of shear layers at the corner and transition occurring at Lt* > 0.5), and shear layer transition II (Re > 1 × 10^{3}, reattachment of shear layers on the side surface and transition occurring at Lt* < 0.5). Robichaux et_al [14] and Yoon et_al [15] observed that the flow separates from the trailing corners at Re < 120 but from the leading corners at Re > 120. The flow regimes have been marked and sketched at the top of Fig. 10, distinguishing the variation in Lf*.
For the circular cylinder wake, Lf* reduces rapidly with increasing Re in the laminar regime at Re < 1.6 × 10^{2}, similar to the Lf* behavior of the square cylinder (Fig. 10). However, in the post-transition regime, L_{f} increases gradually at 2.6 × 10^{2} < Re < 1.5 × 10^{3}, reaches a maximum of 2.3 at Re = 1.5 × 10^{3}, and then decays progressively to 1.2 at Re = 2.0 × 10^{5}. At Re > 2.0 × 10^{4}, Lf* approaches asymptotically a constant of around 1.2, higher than that of the square cylinder wake. Interestingly, the variation in Lf* with Re at Re = 2.6 × 10^{2}–1.5 × 10^{3} differs between the square and circular cylinder wakes. This difference can be ascribed to the distinct natures of the flow separation over the square and circular cylinders. At this Re range, the flow separation occurs at the leading edge of the square cylinder [Figs. 8(b) and 8(c)], the separation line being straight and time-independent (Fig. 6). On the contrary, the flow separation line over the surface of the circular cylinder is oscillatory, following the rhythm of the primary vortex shedding and undulated by the streamwise vortical structures [20,46]. Furthermore, the reverse flow in the wake of the circular cylinder has an influence on the streamwise vortices [7]. Therefore, the increase in Lf* with Re for the circular cylinder may result from a strong interaction between the streamwise vortices and the flow separation.
The dependence on Re of the wake width W^{*} is presented in Fig. 11. The spatial resolution in the PIV measurements at Re > 1.0 × 10^{3} leads to an uncertainty of 2.2% in W^{*}. The data at Re < 1.6 × 10^{2} and Re > 2 × 10^{2} are separately used in the least-squares power law curve fitting. W^{*} with Re decreases from 1.46 at Re = 60 to 0.95 at Re = 1.6 × 10^{2} gradually in the laminar regime, following W^{*} = −4 × 10^{−4}Re + 1.63 and then increases progressively in the post-transition regime, following W^{*} = −14Re^{−0.85} + 1.15 (Re > 1.8 × 10^{2}). W^{*} approaches asymptotically a constant of 1.15 at Re > 2 × 10^{4}, based on the fitted curve. The minimum W^{*}, around 0.95, is attained in the transition regime. It is well known that W^{*} is linked to the fluid force acting on a bluff body, the larger the W^{*}, the lower the base pressure [47]. Robichaux et_al [14] observed a linear increase in the base pressure coefficient with Re at 70 < Re < 2.2 × 10^{2}, in line with the linear decrease of W^{*} with Re in the same Re range (Fig. 11).
C. Shear layer transition
A shear layer separating from the square cylinder bridges the boundary layer developing over the cylinder surface and rolled-up vortices evolving downstream. Figure 12 presents typical time histories of the hotwire-measured streamwise velocity u/ū at (x^{*}, y^{*}) = (−0.1, 0.15), (0.25, 0.25), and (0.8, 0.35) for Re = 3.0 × 10^{3} [see Fig. 2(a)]. The data presented in Fig. 12 are chosen from a group of hotwire measurements at different Re. Obviously, the variation in u/ū is regular and periodic at (x^{*}, y^{*}) = (−0.1, 0.15), suggesting that the shear layer is laminar at this location [Fig. 12(a)]. When the measurement location is moved to (x^{*}, y^{*}) = (0.25, 0.25), u/ū variation displays the occurrence of spikes and bursts in a random fashion [Fig. 12(b)], indicating the onset of the transition in the shear layer. The time history of streamwise fluctuating velocity in Fig. 12(b) indeed shows the transition from the laminar flow (at t^{*} = 0–300) to turbulent flow (at t^{*} = 300–700). The signals in the former and latter ranges of t^{*} bear similar characteristics to those measured at (x^{*}, y^{*}) = (−0.1, 0.15) and (0.8, 0.35), respectively, which suggests that the transition to turbulent occurs at (x^{*}, y^{*}) = (0.25, 0.25). The transition feature in Fig. 12(b) is quite typical in the hotwire data measured at (x^{*}, y^{*}) = (0.25, 0.25). The shear layers become fully turbulent at (x^{*}, y^{*}) = (0.8, 0.35) where more spikes and bursts appear [Fig. 12(c)]. The power spectral density (PSD) functions of the signals are presented in Fig. 13. A profound peak can be detected at f^{*} = 0.136 for the laminar signals. However, this is not the case for the transition and post-transition signals; instead, the peak is broad, embedded within the noise.
The auto-correlation function ρ_{uu}(τ) of the streamwise fluctuating velocity is evaluated to further distinguish the laminar, transition, and post-transition in the shear layer, where τ is the time-delay. The autocorrelation results are as presented in Fig. 14 for the fluctuating velocity in Fig. 12. It can be seen that ρ_{uu}(τ) for (x^{*}, y^{*}) = (−0.1, 0.15) exhibits a clear oscillation, with amplitude decaying slowly with τ^{*}, which again indicates that the signal u is regular and periodic. That is, the flow is laminar at this point. However, ρ_{uu}(τ) for (x^{*}, y^{*}) = (0.25, 0.25) and (0.8, 0.35) is small compared to that for (x^{*}, y^{*}) = (−0.1, 0.15). The periodicity in ρ_{uu}(τ) with τ^{*} cannot be identified at τ^{*} > 90 (Fig. 14). ρ_{uu}(τ) at τ^{*} < 70, however, displays two periodicities, the longer and lower periods corresponding to von Kármán shedding and Kevin-Helmholtz vortices. The ρ_{uu}(τ) amplitude associated with Kevin-Helmholtz vortices is weaker at (x^{*}, y^{*}) = (0.25, 0.25) than at (x^{*}, y^{*}) = (0.8, 0.35). The difference explains transition and post-transition occurring at the former and latter points, respectively.
The position of the shear layer transition can be quantified as a length scale L_{t} defined by the streamwise distance between the cylinder center and the location for the onset of transition in the shear layer [48]. In the experimental tests, the location for the onset of shear layer transition is determined through careful visual inspection of the hotwire-measured u signals and autocorrelations, while in the numerical simulations subgrid turbulent viscosity ratios are used with a threshold of 0.04. The uncertainty in L_{t} from the hotwire measurements (Re > 1.0 × 10^{3}) is 0.01D based on the spatial resolution in the measurement positions. Figure 15 presents the dependence of Lt* on Re. The circular cylinder case, reproduced from the work of Zdravkovich [44], is included for the sake of comparison. An increase in Re leads to Lt* declining exponentially, which is described as Lt*=1.6×10^{2}Re^{−0.81} (Re > 1.6 × 10^{2}). While Lt* ≈ 2.0–2.7 in the transition regime (1.6 × 10^{2} < Re < 2.2 × 10^{2}), Lt* = 0.5 at Re = 1 × 10^{3}. The reduction rate slows down at Re > 1 × 10^{3}. The reduction in Lt* with Re is in line with the reduction in L_{f}^{*} with Re (Fig. 10). Interestingly, Lt* > 0.5 in transition regime I but Lt* < 0.5 in transition regime II, explaining why the shear layer reattachment occurs at the corner and side surface for the transition regimes I and II, respectively. The dotted-dashed line for the circular cylinder is obtained from the hotwire-measured data by Bloor [48], Bloor and Gerrard [49], and Gerrard [50].Lt* for the circular cylinder rapidly decreases at Re < 5.0 × 10^{2}, levels off at 5.0 × 10^{2} < Re < 1.0 × 10^{3}, declines almost linearly at 1.0 × 10^{3} < Re < 3.0 × 10^{4}, and becomes less sensitive to Re at 4.0 × 10^{4} < Re < 8.0 × 10^{4}. The almost unchanged Lt* observed at 5.0 × 10^{2} < Re < 1.0 × 10^{3} is ascribed to the delayed rolling-up of the shear layers. Overall, Lt* is larger for the circular cylinder than for the square cylinder at Re > 3.0 × 10^{2}, with the largest departure from each other occurring at Re ≈ 2.0 × 10^{3}.
D. Mean drag force
The time-mean drag coefficient is defined as C¯{d}=F¯{d}/(0.5ρDL_{z}U∞2), where F¯{d} is the time-mean drag force measured by the force balance at Re ≥ 1.0 × 10^{3} or estimated from the numerical simulation results at Re ≤ 1.0 × 10^{3}, L_{z} is the span of the square cylinder, and ρ is the fluid density. Shown in Fig. 16 is the relationship between C¯{d} and Re. To provide an overview of the dependence of C¯{d} on Re, the published data for a wide range of Re = 1–10^{7} are comprehensively collected in Fig. 16. Meanwhile, the dependence of C¯{d} on Re for a circular cylinder, reproduced from the work of Tritton [10], is included in Fig. 16 for a comparison purpose. Furthermore, Table II displays a quantitative comparison of C¯{d} at different Re from 10^{2} to 10^{3}. The present numerical and experimental data are in good agreement with those from the literature at 60 ≤ Re ≤ 4.0 × 10^{4}, providing a validation to the present simulations and force measurements.
It is worthy providing a synthesis discussion of the relationship between C¯{d} and Re, connecting the wake characteristic parameters L_{f}^{*} and W^{*}. These are the parameters having a close connection with C¯{d}. Generally, a shorter L_{f}^{*} or a larger W^{*} corresponds to a higher C¯{d} and vice versa [8,44,47,48,51]. As shown in Fig. 16, C¯{d} for the square cylinder exponentially decreases in the laminar flow regime (at Re < 1.6 × 10^{2}). The relationship between C¯{d} and Re can be presented as C¯{d}=13.2Re^{−0.85}+1.2 (as indicated by the solid line in Fig. 16), obtained using least-squares curve fitting of the data at Re < 1.6 × 10^{2}. Though C¯{d} at Re < 1.6 × 10^{2} is expressed by a single equation, the decrease of C¯{d} with Re is attributed to different physics at Re < 50 and 50–1.6 × 10^{2}. In the steady flow regime (at Re < 50), a pair of symmetric recirculation bubbles (laminar eddies) forms downstream of the cylinder, elongating in the streamwise direction with an increase in Re [30]. The decrease of C¯{d} with increasing Re in this regime is attributed to the elongation of the bubbles accompanied by an increased base pressure [30]. On the other hand, alternating von Kármán vortex shedding takes place at 50 < Re < 1.6 × 10^{2} (unsteady laminar flow) with both L_{f}^{*} and W^{*} shortening with Re (Figs. 10 and 11). While the shortening of W^{*} tends to decrease C¯{d}, that of L_{f}^{*} does the opposite. The influence of W^{*} becoming dominant leads to the decrease in C¯{d}. In the transition regime (1.6 × 10^{2} < Re < 2.2 × 10^{2}) where L_{f}^{*} is almost invariant (Fig. 10), C¯{d} reaches a minimum of around 1.44 at Re = 182, complementing a minimum W^{*} (Fig. 11). Beyond the transition regime, C¯{d} increases rapidly for 2.2 × 10^{2} < Re < 1.0 × 10^{3} and then levels off at Re > 2.0 × 10^{3}, approaching a constant value of around 2.21. The rapid increase in C¯{d} at 2.2 × 10^{2} < Re < 1.0 × 10^{3} is connected to a rapid drop in L_{f}^{*} (Fig. 10) and a progressive increase in W^{*} (Fig. 11). Following almost invariant L_{f}^{*} and W^{*} for Re > 1.0 × 10^{3}, C¯{d} becomes more or less constant. The relationship between C¯{d} and Re for Re > 2.2 × 10^{2} can be described by the power law, C¯{d}=−8.6×10^{2}Re^{−1.27}+2.21.
Figure 17 presents typical time histories of the drag coefficients for the laminar, transition, and turbulent regimes. The signal for the laminar flow [Fig. 17(a)] features a rather regular periodicity and amplitude, indicating that the laminar vortices alternatively shed from the cylinder. On the contrary, those for the transition [Fig. 17(b)] and turbulent flows [Fig. 17(c)] behave distinctively. First, the time history in Fig. 17(b) is indicative of the growth of the mode A instability in the near wake. It can be seen that rather regular periodic oscillation of C_{d}, which is associated with the two-dimensional laminar vortex shedding [Fig. 18(a)], is reached at t^{*} = 90–140. However, due to the onset of mode A instability, the periodic oscillation of C_{d} changes into intermittent packets of oscillation at t^{*} > 140, with the transition from a packet of a high-amplitude oscillation to that of a low-amplitude oscillation. That is, the drag force fluctuates with a relatively large magnitude as the wake is two-dimensional [e.g., t^{*} = 90–140, Figs. 17(b) and 18(a)] but with a relatively small magnitude as the wake is three-dimensional [e.g., t^{*} = 200–250, Figs. 17(b) and 18(b)]. As such, two different C¯{d} in the transition regime (Table II) are presented, calculated separately for the laminar and turbulent states, based on the examination of the time histories of the drag force. A similar observation was made in the previous DNS work [20]. Our simulation revealed that the intermittent packets of oscillation appeared in a random manner up to t^{*} = 1000 examined. Second, the drag force signal for the turbulent flow [Fig. 17(c)] exhibits the representative turbulence fluctuation, echoing the turbulent wake comprising both large- and small-scale flow structures (Fig. 6).
The power spectral density (PSD) functions of the drag signals are presented in Fig. 19. Clearly, dominant peaks are observed for the three states of the flow. For the laminar flow (Re = 100), the peak is detected at f^{*} = 0.295, while for the turbulent flow (Re = 500) it is identified at f^{*} ≈ 0.272. As expected, for the transitional flow (Re = 182), twin peaks are detected at f^{*} = 0.303 and 0.32, indicating the turbulent and laminar states, respectively. As expected, the peaks from the drag signals occur at twice the dominant frequencies obtained in the power spectra of the lift signals (Fig. 9).
It is of interest to compare the square cylinder wake with the circular cylinder, in terms of the dependence of C¯{d} on Re. It can be seen that C¯{d} for the circular cylinder decreases at Re < 2.0 × 10^{2}. A similar trend is observed for the square cylinder at the same Re range. However, with further increasing Re (>2.0 × 10^{2}), C¯{d} for the circular cylinder maintains the declination, albeit at a smaller rate, until Re = 2.0 × 10^{3}, which is opposite to that in the square cylinder counterpart. C¯{d} for the circular cylinder does not change much; C¯{d} = 1.1–1.2 for Re = 2.0 × 10^{3}–1.0 × 10^{5}. The so-called critical flow regime appears at Re = 2.0 × 10^{5}–4.0 × 10^{5} where C¯{d} drops suddenly. This is ascribed to the postponed flow separation and formation of separation bubbles, both linked to the boundary layer transition from laminar to turbulent [39]. The critical regime is not observed in the square cylinder wake as the flow separation is fixed on the sharp corners and thus insensitive to Re. Beyond Re = 4.0 × 10^{5}, C¯{d} for the circular cylinder climbs gradually and then levels off with an increase in Re.
E. Strouhal number
Figure 20 presents the relationship between St and Re. St from the present numerical simulations is estimated using the fluctuating lift force, while that from the present experimental tests are calculated using the hotwire measured fluctuating velocities. The present numerical and experimental data are in general consistent with those from the literature (see also Table II). With increasing Re at 50 < Re < 1.0 × 10^{3}, St increases and attains a maximum at Re ≈ 2.0 × 10^{2} before declining from 0.16 to 0.12 at 2.0 × 10^{2} < Re < 1.0 × 10^{3}. The increase of St from ≈0.11 to 0.16 with Re in the laminar unsteady flow at 50 < Re < 1.6 × 10^{2} can be represented by the solid curve St = −3.8Re^{−1} + 0.18. There is a scattering of St data at the transitional regime.
The present and collected data at 2.2 × 10^{2} < Re < 1.0 × 10^{3} are used to fit into a curve St = 0.54Re^{−0.23}. At 1.0 × 10^{3} < Re < 2.0 × 10^{5}, St augments following St = −1.9Re^{−0.73} + 0.134 (dotted-dashed line). Though covering a wide range of Re = 1.0 × 10^{3}–5.0 × 10^{6}, the LES data by Sohankar [29] appear slightly lower than those by others; therefore, his data are not included in the curve fitting for Re > 1.0 × 10^{3}. For the circular cylinder wake, St with Re increases progressively to a maximum of 0.22 at Re = 1.0 × 10^{3}, indicating an increase in the shedding frequency of the dominant vortices. However, with further increasing Re from 1.0 × 10^{3} to 1.0 × 10^{5}, St declines slowly from 0.22 to 0.2 due to the shear layer transition. Noticeable vortex shedding is difficult to be detected in the cylinder near wake as the flow goes into the critical regime at Re > 1.0 × 10^{5}, which is indicated by3tthe dotted line in Fig. 20.
F. Global view of the flow dependence on Re
It is worth summarizing the global flow features at different flow regimes at a glance. Table III lists the prominent characteristics and dependence of different parameters on Re. The up and down arrows in the table, respectively, indicate increase and decrease with Re, while the horizontal arrow denotes approaching asymptotic value. In the steady flow regime (Re < 50), generated immediately downstream of the square cylinder is a pair of symmetric recirculation bubbles, which are elongated with increasing Re, corresponding to the declining C¯{d}. No vortex shedding is identified at Re < 50. In the laminar wake regime (50 < Re < 160), vortex shedding is however observed, and the unsteady wake is two-dimensional. The flow separation occurs from the trailing corners for 50 < Re < 120 and from the leading corners for 120 < Re < 160. Both the vortex formation length (Lf*) and wake width (W^{*}) decreases with an increase in Re, accompanied by a reduction in C¯{d} and a rise in St. The transition from two- to three-dimensional and vice versa in the flow occurs in the transition regime (160 < Re < 220). The primary spanwise vortex shedding is accompanied by the streamwise vortex loops with a large spanwise wavelength of around 5D. Two different values of C¯{d} and St are detected, with the higher C¯{d} (higher St) and lower C¯{d} (lower St) corresponding to the two-dimensional laminar and three-dimensional turbulent flow, respectively. In the transition regime, Lf* is virtually unvaried, W^{*} and C¯{d} reach their minima, and St attains its maximum. The cylinder wake becomes turbulent at Re > 220. Shear layer transition I is recognized at 220 < Re < 1.0 × 10^{3}, where the laminar shear layer reattaches on the trailing corner and then the transition occurs downstream of the trailing corner [52–58].Lt* decreases exponentially with Re, together with the decreasing Lf* and St; however, W^{*} increases progressively, associated with a rising C¯{d} [59], with an increase in Re. Finally, shear layer transition II is noted at Re > 1.0 × 10^{3} as the shear layer reattaches on the side surface due to the occurrence of laminar to turbulent shear layer transition upstream of the trailing corner. With increasing Re, all the flow parameters (i.e., Lf*, W^{*}, Lt*, C¯{d}, and St) approach their corresponding constants in this regime. For example, C¯{d} → 2.21 and St → 0.134.
V. SUMMARY
The wake of a square cylinder is extensively investigated for Re < 10^{7}. The dependence on Re of the streamwise length of steady recirculation bubble Lr*, vortex formation length Lf*, wake width W^{*}, shear layer transition length Lt*, time-mean drag coefficient C¯{d}, and Strouhal number St are documented. Their dependence corresponds to five flow regimes, namely, steady flow (Re < 50), laminar flow (50 < Re < 1.6 × 10^{2}), two- to three-dimensional transition flow (1.6 × 10^{2} < Re < 2.2 × 10^{2}), shear layer transition I (2.2 × 10^{2} < Re < 1.0 × 10^{3}), and shear layer transition II (Re > 1.0 × 10^{3}). A discussion is made on the comparison of the square cylinder results obtained presently with the circular cylinder results from the literature.
At Re < 50, the flow around a square cylinder is steady, characterized by a pair of counter-rotating recirculating bubbles downstream of the cylinder. No alternating von Kármán vortex shedding occurs from the cylinder. With increasing Re, Lr* grows rapidly from 0.6 to 3.5 and C¯{d} declines gradually.
At 50 < Re < 1.6 × 10^{2}, the unsteady laminar flow occurs, with the alternating von Kármán vortex shedding from the cylinder. Lf* dips rapidly from 5.0 to 2.2 with Re. A circular cylinder has a similar trend in this Re range. W^{*} decreases from 1.46 at Re = 60 to 0.95 at Re = 1.6 × 10^{2}. The variation in C¯{d} with Re is similar to that in W^{*} in view of internal coherence. C¯{d} declines slowly as Re is increased to 1.6 × 10^{2}. However, St grows from 0.11 to 0.16 when Re is increased from 50 to 1.6 × 10^{2}.
At 1.6 × 10^{2} < Re < 2.2 × 10^{2}, mode A and mode B instabilities prevail, resulting in the transition from two-to three-dimensionality in the cylinder wake. Streamwise vortices come into being with a spanwise wavelength of 5D in mode A and 1.2D in mode B. Lf* remains unchanged, W^{*} and C¯{d} reach their minima, and St becomes the maximum at this transition flow regime.
At 2.2 × 10^{2} < Re < 1.0 × 10^{3}, shear layer transition I is observed, where the transition in the shear layer occurs downstream of (Lt*> 0.5) the trailing corner of the cylinder. Lf* drops again rapidly from 2.2 to 1.1 with Re increasing from 2.2 × 10^{2} to 1.0 × 10^{3}. On the contrary, Lf* for the circular cylinder varies oppositely at this Re range, increasing progressively with Re. Lf* is greater for the circular cylinder than for the square cylinder at Re > 3.0 × 10^{2}. With increasing Re from 2.2 × 10^{2} to 1.0 × 10^{3}, W^{*} and C¯{d} increase from their minima, St decreases from 0.16 to 0.12, and Lt* drops from 2.0 to 0.5. On the other hand, Lt* for the circular cylinder reduces for Re = 2.2 × 10^{2}–7 × 10^{2} and levels off for Re = 7 × 10^{2}–1.0 × 10^{3}.
At Re > 1.0 × 10^{3}, shear layer transition II is identified. The transition in the shear layer occurs upstream of (Lt*< 0.5) the trailing corner of the cylinder, and the shear layer alternately reattaches on the side surface of the cylinder. Lf* asymptotically approaches a constant value of about Lf* ≈ 1.0. On the contrary, Lf* for the circular cylinder reaches its maximum of 2.3 at Re = 1.5 × 10^{3} and then decreases gradually to 1.2 at Re = 2.0 × 10^{5}. Both W^{*} and C¯{d} increasing with Re become almost constant at Re > 1.0 × 10^{4}, with C¯{d} ≈ 2.21 at Re > 1.0 × 10^{4}. On the other hand, C¯{d} for the circular cylinder becomes almost a constant of 1.2 at 1.0 × 10^{3} < Re < 2.0 × 10^{5} that is followed by a sudden dip at 2.0 × 10^{5} < Re < 5.0 × 10^{5} and recovers at Re > 5.0 × 10^{5}. No drag crisis flow regime is identified for the square cylinder. Lt* decreases more rapidly for the square cylinder than the circular cylinder at this Re range, approaching an asymptotic value at Re > 1.0 × 10^{4} and 4.0 × 10^{4} for the circular and square cylinders, respectively. St having a slow recovery at 1.0 × 10^{3} < Re < 4.0 ×10^{3} becomes ∼0.134 for Re > 4.0 ×10^{3}. St for the circular cylinder reaches the maximum of about 0.22 at Re ≈ 1.0 × 10^{3} but declines to about 0.2 at Re = 1.0 × 10^{5}, followed by a sharp rise at the drag crisis flow regime.
