Influence of driving frequency on discharge modes in the dielectric barrier discharge excited by a triangle voltage
A one-dimensional fluid model in atmospheric pressure argon is employed to investigate the influence of the driving frequency on dielectric barrier discharge modes excited by a triangle voltage. Results indicate that a stepped discharge mode is obtained with a low driving frequency of 35 kHz. The current amplitude increases, while its plateau duration decreases with increasing the frequency. The stepped discharge transits into a multi-pulsed mode when the frequency is increased to 80 kHz. With its further increment, the pulse number decreases, and a double-pulsed discharge is realized at 90 kHz, which finally transits to a single-pulsed discharge. Through analyzing spatial distributions of electron density, ion density, and electric field, it can be concluded that the discharge regime transits from a Townsend-like discharge to a glow discharge with increasing the frequency. The regime transition is further verified by analyzing voltage-current curves. These simulated results are consistent with the experimental phenomena.
I. INTRODUCTION
Non-thermal plasma generated at atmospheric pressure has attracted considerable interest due to its potential applications in various fields, such as thin-film deposition [1–3], surface modification [4,5], ozone generation [6], and wastewater treatment [7]. As one of the most important ways to generate such plasma, dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) has been extensively investigated [8,9].
For the DBD operated at atmospheric pressure, numerous micro-discharge filaments are often presented, which distribute stochastically in space and time [10,11]. Under certain conditions, homogeneous DBD can also be generated, which is in a glow regime [12–14], or a Townsend one [13,14]. Homogeneous DBD has been reported for the first time in helium by Okazaki and collaborators [15]. Thereafter, considerable investigations including experiments and numerical simulations have been carried out on this kind of DBD [16–19]. Sublet et_al have pointed out that the discharge regime varies with the dissipated power and the gas gap [16]. A transition from the Townsend regime to the glow one has been experimentally investigated during one discharge pulse of helium DBD [17]. Through numerical simulation, the regime transition in helium has also been found with changing the peak voltage or the driving frequency [18,19]. Besides the discharge regime, Radu et_al have pointed out that the pulse number per half voltage cycle decreases with increasing the driving frequency or decreasing the voltage amplitude [20]. Different to the above-mentioned pulsed DBDs excited by a sinusoidal voltage, a stepped discharge mode is predicted through numerical simulation on the DBD in helium [21], which has been realized in argon through a triangle voltage excitation [22].
In this paper, a detailed study on the discharge modes of the micro-gap DBD in argon is carried out with varying the triangle frequency through a one-dimensional self-consistent fluid model.
II. MODEL DESCRIPTION
The DBD excited by the triangle voltage is generated in pure argon between two parallel-plate electrodes, each of which is covered with a thin dielectric layer, as shown in Fig. 1. The following species are considered in the model: ground state atom (Ar), electron e, atomic ion (Ar^{+}), molecular ion (Ar2+), and compound states (Ar*). Ar* refers to the metastable state and the resonant state of the argon 4s system because their energies are very close. There is a large probability for a metastable to turn into a resonant and for a resonant to turn into a metastable by electron collisions [23]. Hence, we do not discriminate between them and use Ar* to represent both of them. Table I provides the chemical reactions in conjunction with the corresponding coefficients and the references. The gas temperature is assumed to maintain at 300 K. Densities of the charged particles in the gas gap are described by the continuity equation
where subscripts e, p, and m represent electron, ion, and metastable particle, respectively. n and S are the particle density and source term, respectively. With the drift-diffusion approximation, the flux (j) is given by
Here, μ and D are the mobility and diffusion coefficients, respectively, whose values are taken from the literature [19]. Instead of solving Poisson's equation, the electric field (E) is given from the current conservation equation
Here, the permittivity ε_{(x)} is ε_{0} in the gas gap and ε_{b}(ε_{b} = 7.5) in the dielectric layers. i_{T} and i_{C} are the total current density and the discharge current density, respectively. i_{T} can be obtained by integrating Eq. (4). The above set of equations is numerically solved in accordance with the semi-implicit Scharfetter-Gummel scheme. During the simulation, the argon gap and the dielectric thickness are fixed at 0.4 mm and 0.5 mm, respectively. The amplitude of the applied voltage is fixed at 1.7 kV. More detailed descriptions of the model can be found in our previous paper [21].
It should be pointed out that the homogeneous discharge in argon will be destroyed and transit to a filamentary one with increasing the driving frequency [22]. A One-dimensional model would fail to encapsulate the physics of filamentary discharge. Accordingly, a three-dimensional model is more suitable. Considering the heavy computation of three-dimensional model, only a one-dimensional model is used in this paper, which is valid to investigate the mode transitions with increasing the driving frequency. Later, we will upgrade it to three dimensions and investigate more complicated behaviors of DBDs.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Figure 2 shows waveforms of V_{a}, V_{g}, and i_{c} under different frequencies of the triangle voltage. It can be found that a residual current peak appears after the inversion of the current polarity [28]. The residual peaks are asymmetric for different polarities. This current asymmetry has also been numerically investigated in DBD [29,30]. Besides the residual peak, there is only one plateau per half voltage cycle for the so-called stepped discharge when the driving frequency is 35 kHz, as shown in Fig. 2(a). Comparing Fig. 2(a) with Fig. 2(b), it can be found that the plateau amplitude increases and its duration decreases with increasing the frequency. Some pulses are superimposed on the plateau and the discharge transits to a multi-pulsed mode, as shown in Fig. 2(c). In addition, the pulse number decreases with increasing the frequency, and a double-pulsed discharge appears, as presented in Fig. 2(d). Only two pulses appear per half voltage cycle, whose peaks are higher than those of the multi-pulsed discharge. The double-pulsed discharge sustains in a frequency range, as indicated in Figs. 2(d) and 2(e). Obviously, peak values increase with increasing the driving frequency. Finally, a single-pulsed discharge is realized with only one discharge pulse per half voltage cycle, as shown in Fig. 2(f). The single-pulsed mode has a higher peak than the double-pulsed one. Therefore, it can be concluded that the discharge undergoes a scenario from the stepped mode, the multi-pulsed one, the double-pulsed one, and finally to the single-pulsed one with increasing the frequency. During this process, the maximal current increases.
The results simulated above have higher transition frequencies than the experimental ones [22]. The difference in the transition frequency can be partly attributed to the fact that with increasing the driving frequency, the peak voltage decreases in the experiment; however, it is constant in our simulation. Hence, the mode transition in Ref [22] is influenced by both the peak voltage and the driving frequency, while only the frequency has been investigated here. Moreover, the applied voltage seriously deviates from the triangle waveform at a higher frequency in Ref [22]. All of these factors lead to the difference in the transition frequency between the experiment and our simulation.
As a comparison to the triangle excitation, waveforms of V_{a}, V_{g}, and i_{c} are presented in Fig. 3 under different frequencies of a sinusoidal voltage. A residual current peak also appears immediately after the discharge current changes its polarity. Besides the residual peak, only one discharge hump appears per half voltage cycle, as shown in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b).The hump amplitude increases and its duration (full width at half maximum) decreases with increasing the frequency, as shown in Figs. 3(a) to 3(e). Finally, the single-pulsed mode is obtained at 140 kHz. The transition from the hump mode to the single-pulsed one has also been found in the DBD with a 3.0 mm helium gap [19]. Comparing Fig. 2 with Fig. 3, it can be found that the triangle excitation presents more discharge modes than the sinusoidal excitation besides the difference between the stepped mode and the hump one.
Figure 4 shows spatial distributions of electron, ion, and electric field at different moments of the stepped discharge, which corresponds to Fig. 2(b). It can be found that maxima of the electron density and the ion density appear in the vicinity of the anode. Moreover, the maxima electron density increases with time at the rising edge of the stepped discharge (8.73 μs and 10.27 μs) until it keeps constant at the current plateau (12.71 μs and 13.62 μs). The stepped discharge has some similarities to the Townsend regime such as the maximal electron density close to the instantaneous anode and the absence of a positive column [13,31]. However, compared with the Townsend regime, the space charges (positive ions) are not too low, and more importantly, the electric field is fairly non-uniform in the gap, which increases with increasing distance from the anode. Hence, the stepped discharge is in neither the Townsend regime nor the glow regime, which should be considered as an intermediate regime between them [32,33]. Consequently, it can be classified as a Townsend-like regime in this meaning.
In the Townsend-like regime, electron avalanches develop towards the anode, resulting in the increasing electron density from the cathode to the anode. Due to the low driving frequency of the stepped discharge, the applied electric field (E_{a}) increases slowly with time (dE_{a}dt is constant).Once the net field reaches the critical value for gas breakdown, electron avalanches develop in the gap. Then, electrons and cations drift towards the anode and the cathode, respectively, to form surface charges on the dielectrics, which will induce a field (E_{s}) counter to E_{a}. dE_{s}dt is proportional to the first ionization coefficient (α). At the beginning of the stepped discharge, the α coefficient is fairly low because of the low net field, resulting in dE_{s}dt<dE_{a}dt. Hence, the net field (E_{a}–E_{s}) increases with time, and the electron density increases with time [Fig. 4(a)] because of the increasing α coefficient with the net field. Accordingly, dE_{s}dt will increase with time. This process corresponds to the rising stage of the stepped discharge, as shown in Fig. 4(c) from 8.73 μs to 12.71 μs. With the increasing dE_{s}dt, the discharge reaches its plateau when dE_{s}dt equals to dE_{a}dt. Hence, the higher frequency (corresponds to the higher dE_{a}dt) is used, the higher dE_{s}dt is reached, which comes from a higher net field and a higher electron density at the plateau. Consequently, the plateau amplitude increases with increasing the frequency (Fig. 2).
Temporal evolutions of the surface charge density at position x_{1} (σ(x_{1})) and V_{g} for the triangle excitation at 50 kHz are presented in Fig. 5. After the polarity of V_{g} is reversed at moment A, electrons drift towards the instantaneous anode positioned at x_{1}, which neutralize positive charges accumulated on the dielectric surface by the last discharge, resulting in a slow decrement of σ(x_{1}) from moment A to moment B. With the increasing current, more electrons reach the dielectric per unit time, resulting in a rapid decrement of σ(x_{1}) from moment B to moment C. Until moment D,σ(x_{1}) keeps decreasing due to a continuous charging of the dielectric by the positive current. It can also be found from Fig. 5 that the slope rate of σ(x_{1}) is constant from moment A to moment C, which originates from the constant current. After moment D, the current changes its polarity, which results in an increasing σ(x_{1}) with time.
Figure 6(a) illustrates spatial distributions of electron, ion, and electric field at the peak moments marked with numbers 1 and 2 of the double-pulsed mode in Fig. 2(d). Similar to the stepped discharge, the maximal electron density is located near the anode, which suggests that the double-pulsed mode at 90 kHz is also in the Townsend-like regime. It can also be found from Fig. 6(a) that the ion density is much higher than the electron density, which originates from a much higher mobility of electrons than ions. More electrons reach the dielectric surface than positive ions, resulting in more ions left in the gap.
As mentioned earlier, dE_{s}dt is lower than dE_{a}dt at the beginning of the Townsend-like discharge, which leads to the increment of the current. If the current is higher enough (higher than the plateau amplitude), positive ions will accumulate in front of the cathode, as shown in Fig. 6(a). These accumulated ions will enhance the electric field near the cathode. Therefore, the α coefficient is enhanced there, which induces an enhanced dE_{s}dt. Consequently, dE_{s}dt is higher than dE_{a}dt at the peak moment, while they are equivalent for the current plateau. Then, the discharge current as well as dE_{s}dt decreases with time. As a result, dE_{s}dt will be lower than dE_{a}dt. Under this condition, the discharge current will increase again, and another pulse following the last one will appear. Consequently, current pulses are superposed on the plateau in the multi-pulsed mode (80 kHz) and the double-pulsed mode (90 kHz).The lack of these two modes under the sinusoidal excitation can also be attributed to the decreasing dE_{a}dt with time, which is constant under the triangle excitation. At the rising phase of the sinusoidal voltage, no more current pulse can appear if dE_{a}dt decreases so fast that dE_{s}dt<dE_{a}dt cannot be met again after one pulse.
At 100 kHz, spatial distributions of electron, ion, and electric field are illustrated in Fig. 6(b). It can be found that a positive column appears in the region with the electron density equivalent to the ion density (roughly 4.4 × 10^{11} cm^{−3}). In the positive column, the electric field is one order of magnitude lower than that near the cathode. That is to say, a cathode fall region is formed in front of the instantaneous cathode. The existence of the cathode fall region and the positive column indicates that the discharge belongs to the glow regime. Under an increment of the frequency from 90 kHz to 100 kHz, the maximal electron density increases by a factor 3.
Figure 7 shows spatial distributions of electron, ion, and electric field at different moments of a current pulse in Fig. 2(f). At the beginning of the pulse (4.01 μs), the maximal electron density appears near the anode. Consequently, the discharge at the rising edge of the pulse is in the Townsend-like regime. Maxima of the electron density and the ion density increase with time, which are accompanied by the increment of the electric field in front of the cathode (4.04 μs). Finally, a cathode fall region is formed at 4.06 μs. With the elapse of time, the glow discharge transits back to the Townsend-like regime after the peak moment (4.15 μs).
In order to further verify the transition of the discharge regime, Fig. 8 presents V_{g} as a function of the current density (V-I curve).As shown in Fig. 8(a), V_{g} in the stepped discharge first increases and then almost maintains constant with increasing i_{c}. Compared with the V-I curve of a direct-current discharge [31], the drastic variation of the current under a nearly constant V_{g} is in agreement with the Townsend discharge behavior [13]. Hence, the stepped discharge transits from a non-self-sustained discharge to the Townsend-like one. Figure 8(b) has a similar V-I curve with the stepped discharge. Hence, the double-pulsed mode at 90 kHz also belongs to the Townsend-like regime. However, for the double pulsed mode at 100 kHz, V_{g} first increases and then decreases with increasing i_{c}, as shown in Fig. 8(c). The negative differential conductivity verifies that the discharge belongs to the glow regime [34]. Similarly, the V-I curve in Fig. 8(d) also proves that the single-pulsed mode is in the glow regime.
Figure 9 presents the averaged densities of electron, ion, and Ar* as functions of the frequency. It can be found that with increasing the frequency, the electron and ion densities monotonously increase, while the Ar* density first increases, reaching a maximum at 80 kHz, then decreases to an almost constant value. The Ar* density as a function of the frequency can be analyzed as follows. According to Table I, Ar* is mainly produced through R2 and R10, and consumed through R3, R5, and R7. With increasing the frequency, it can be deduced from R2 and R10 that the Ar* density increases due to the increasing densities of electrons and ions. However, more Ar* can be consumed through collisions with electrons through R3 because the electron density is too high when the frequency is higher than 80 kHz. Therefore, after reaching its maximum at 80 kHz the Ar* density decreases with further increasing the frequency. The production of Ar* is compensated by its consumption with the frequency higher than 110 kHz. Hence, it stays almost constant with changing the frequency.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
Based on a one-dimensional fluid model at atmospheric pressure, the influence of the driving frequency has been investigated on the discharge modes and the discharge regimes of the argon DBD excited by the triangle voltage. Results indicate that the discharge undergoes a scenario from the stepped mode, the multi-pulsed one, the double-pulsed one, and finally to the single-pulsed mode with increasing the triangle frequency. As a comparison, only two modes including the hump mode and the single-pulsed one are found under the sinusoidal excitation, and the hump mode transits to the single-pulsed one with increasing the frequency. Besides the mode transitions, it has been found that the discharge transits from the Townsend-like regime to the glow regime with increasing the triangle frequency. Both the mode transitions and the regime transition have been qualitatively explained by analyzing the discharge process. Moreover, we have simulated the evolution of the charge transferred during one discharge cycle and the Ar* density as a function of the frequency, which is thought to provide insight into the discharge physics and chemistry.
