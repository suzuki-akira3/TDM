Electronic transport and Raman spectroscopic properties of Co doped (110) PrBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} thin film
The authors deposited Co doped (110) PrBa_{2} Cu_{3}O_{7} (PBCCO) epitaxial thin film using pulsed laser deposition technique and investigated its electronic transport and Raman spectroscopic properties. The authors observed an increase in electrical resistivity by a factor of 50 at 77 K and the existence of three-dimensional variable range hopping mechanism among the localized electronic states on the (110) PBCCO thin film. The activation energies for hopping of the (110) PBCCO thin film was calculated to be 168 meV at 300 K and 75 meV at 77 K suggesting that the hopping was mainly thermally assisted. The Raman spectroscopy measurement on the (110) PBCCO thin film revealed a Raman mode at ∼620 cm^{−1} as an evidence of Cu ion replacement with Co ions at the Cu-O chain site of the PBCO. The replacement of the Cu ions with the Co ions induced disorder and localization of the charge carriers at the chain sites, thereby increasing the electrical resistivity of the (110) PBCCO thin film. In view of higher electrical resistivity and structural and chemical compatibility with YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} (YBCO), (110) PBCCO thin film could serve as an excellent insulator on YBCO based trilayer Josephson junction.
I. INTRODUCTION
A novel electrical insulator is vital for the nanofabrication of high temperature superconductor (HTS) - based superconductor–insulator–superconductor (S-I-S) tunneling Josephson junctions which have potential applications in HTS superconducting quantum interference devices, quantum computing, single-electron transistors, and superconducting terahertz frequency devices. YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7} (YBCO) based S-I-S Josephson junctions possess many advantages over the low temperature superconductor (LTS) based Josephson junctions including their larger I_{c}R_{n} products (where I_{c} and R_{n} represent the junction critical current and normal resistance, respectively) than the LTS based Josephson junctions [1] and their capability to operate in relatively cheaper and less complex liquid nitrogen cryogenic system.
There has been considerable effort toward the development of effective insulating material for the fabrication of a HTS S-I-S tunneling Josephson junction device. Although PBCO (Refs [2–4]) was a conventional insulator, it did not provide sufficient potential barrier in the junction specially when its thickness was less than 200 nm. For example, the electrical resistivity of PBCO at 77 K was only about 0.01 Ω cm for a nanometer thick layer [5].
Several a-axis (100) or c-axis (001) oriented insulators were developed including Co-doped PBCO [6,7], Ga-doped YBCO [8], and Ga-doped PBCO (Refs [9–12]) and were used to fabricate Josephson junctions. Unfortunately, critical temperature (T_{c}) values of these Josephson junctions were less than 77 K, making them unworkable in the liquid nitrogen cryogenic system [9,10]. Interestingly, these insulators were deposited only on [001]-axis (c-axis) or [100]-axis (a-axis) crystal orientation and no (110)-oriented PBCO or metals doped (110)-oriented PBCO thin films can be found in the literature despite their superiority over the (100) or (001) counter parts. Specifically, the advantage of (110)-oriented thin films in the S-I-S junction would be that one can take advantage of a longer coherence length (4 nm on ab plane versus 0.5 nm along c-axis) along the CuO_{2} planes. Also, they possess an unique macroscopic in-plane alignment of their c-axis parallel to the [001] direction of the substrate contrary to the a-axis oriented thin films [13]. Recently, we reported the electronic transport and Raman spectroscopic investigation of (110) PrBa_{2} (Cu_{0.8}M_{0.2}) _{3}O_{7} (M = Zn, Ni, Ga, Al) thin films [14] and here we report those properties on another novel insulating material (110) PrBa_{2}(Cu_{0.8}Co_{0.2})_{3}O_{7} (PBCCO) thin film.
II. EXPERIMENT
A. Bulk synthesis
We synthesized polycrystalline bulk materials of PrBa_{2}[Cu_{0.8}Co_{0.2}]_{3}O_{7} by solid state reaction method using high purity Pr_{6}O_{11} (99.9%), CuO (99.7%), BaCO_{3} (99.95%), and Co_{3}O_{4} (99.9%) which were purchased from Alpha Aesar. These oxide powders were mixed in appropriate proportions, were ground well manually, and placed inside an electric furnace at 950 °C for 48 h. The fired mixture was reground and checked for single phase by x-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Rigaku x-ray diffraction machine. The process of heating and checking with the x-ray diffraction was repeated until the single phase PBCCO was obtained. A 2.54 cm diameter disc (target material) was made by the pressing of the PBCCO powder with a hydraulic press and a subsequent sintering process. The sintering process on the pressed ceramic disk was carried out by the final heat treatment at 925 °C (24 h) followed by an annealing process in oxygen at 450 °C (24 h).
B. Thin film deposition
We used 248 nm wavelength KrF excimer laser of 25 ns FWHM and 1.0 J/cm^{2} energy density in the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) system to deposit (110) PBCCO thin films on (110) LaO single crystal substrate. In the beginning, the chamber was evacuated to a vacuum level of 5 × 10^{−6 }Torr which was subsequently filled with pure oxygen to 500 mTorr pressure. The thin film deposition was carried out in the oxygen pressure of 500 mTorr and the substrate temperature of 750 °C with the growth rate equivalent to 0.3 nm/s. In the end, annealing of the thin film was carried out at a substrate temperature of 500 °C in one atmosphere O_{2} pressure for 1 h.
C. Thin film characterization
We performed x-ray diffraction of the thin films using Cu K_{α} source radiation and the atomic force microscopy (AFM) using the tapping mode in the Veeco dimension 3100 instrument.
We used DC standard four probe technique to measure the electrical resistivity of the thin film samples in a liquid helium cryostat. The Model 321 Cryogenic Temperature Controller (Lakeshore Cryotronics) operating with a silicon diode sensor that could measure temperatures between 500 and 1.2 K was used for the temperature measurement. A constant current source of 1 nA was passed through the outer two leads of the four probe system to measure the potential difference across the inner two leads using the Keithley 2635A source meter (Keithley instruments Inc.).
We performed Raman spectroscopy measurement using Horiba Jobin Yvon T64000 Triple Raman Spectrometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen cooled charge coupled device and a microscope in conjunction with computer-controlled XYZ stage and an Oxford instruments optical cryostat. The 488 and 633 nm lines of lasers were used for the excitation at a power of 0.21 mW under the ×100 objective.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. XRD and AFM
Figure 1 shows the x-ray diffraction pattern of a (110) PBCCO thin film sample. The sample did not contain any second phases. There were some minor peaks for (010), (020), and (030) orientations which contributed less than 1%.
Figure 2 shows the atomic force microscopy measurement of the (110) PBCCO thin film. The RMS roughness of the ∼600 nm thick thin film over 5 × 5 μm scan was measured to be about 5 nm.
B. Electrical resistivity measurement
Figure 3 and Table I show the (110) direction electrical resistivities as a function of temperature for the (110) PBCO, Co doped (110) PBCO, and Zn doped (110) PBCO (PBCZO) thin film. The resistivity of the Co doped (110)-oriented PBCO thin film was significantly higher than that of the (110) PBCO thin films or the Zn doped (110) PBCO thin films. The Zn-doping on the (110) PBCO thin films slightly increased the resistivity of the (110) PBCO thin films.
C. 3D variable range hopping
Figure 4 shows a plot of the natural logarithm of the (110) direction resistivity against T^{−1/4} for (110) PBCO and (110) PBCCO thin films that follow Mott's 3D variable range hopping law
where T_{0} and ρ_{0} are material constants. The plot shows that the linear relation (variable range hopping) exists up to room temperature on (110) PBCCO thin films and only up to 100 K on (110) PBCO thin films indicating that the Co doping expands this range. On (110) PBCO thin films, it is difficult to choose a better fit in the plot of ln ρ vs T^{−1/4}. Fisher et_al [16] have described this type of conduction mechanism as the onset of the nearest neighborhood hopping where the activation energy associated with hopping reaches a constant value when the states at the nearest band edge become accessible to the hopping charge carriers at high temperatures. Also, the (110) PBCO may behave as a typical doped semiconductor with an intrinsic electrical conductivity generated by thermal activation of carriers across the energy gap from the valence band to the conduction bands. According to Mott's law, T_{0} is given by the relation
where N(E_{F}) is the density of the states at the Fermi level, a is the localization radius of the states near the Fermi level, K_{B} is the Boltzmann's constant, and β is a numerical coefficient with its value [15] ∼20. The fitting parameters ρ_{0} and T_{0} have been calculated from the plot and these values for PBCO are in close agreement with the literature [16]. We see an increase in T_{0} values in (110) PBCCO thin films which indicates a decrease in either the density of states at the Fermi level or localization length “a” or both. The localization parameters such as localization radius (a), activation energy for hopping (ε_{0}(T)) and average hopping distance (R) were calculated using the following equations:
Table II shows the calculated values of various hopping conduction parameters including the localization radius, hopping activation energy, and average hopping distances. The increase of the hopping distances and the decrease of the activation energies with respect to the lowering of the temperatures are the characteristics of the variable range hopping conduction mechanism between the localized electronic states. Thus, the electronic states in (110) PBCCO are localized near the Fermi energy by the induced disorder at the Cu-O chain site due to the doped Co ions.
D. Raman spectroscopy
To confirm our electronic transport results that the disorder was induced due to the Co doping on the PBCO, we performed Raman spectroscopy measurements on (110) PBCO and (110) PBCCO thin films. Figure 5 shows the emergence of a Raman mode at ∼620 cm^{−1} on (110) PBCCO sample which does not appear on the (110) PBCO thin film. This vibrational mode at ∼620 cm^{−1} represents the breathing mode of Cu-O chain site on PBCO and is Raman in-active [i.e., infra-red (IR) active] because of the symmetry of the PBCO crystal. However, this mode can become Raman active if the symmetry is broken at the Cu-O chain site of the PBCO. The appearance of this mode in our measurement clearly indicated that the PBCO crystal symmetry was broken at the Cu-O chain site after Co ions replaced some Cu ions from the Cu-O chain sites.
In PBCO, CuO_{2} planes are believed to be nonsuperconducting (insulating) and the Cu-O chain sites are still conducting (with ∼0.5 oxygen 2p holes per Cu atom) locally [17,18]. We argue that the trivalent Co ions replaced some Cu ions (divalent) at the Cu-O chain sites of the PBCO and filled some of the holes at the chain sites. This resulted in less number of holes (charge carriers) for the conduction. Moreover, due to the smaller size of the Co ions compared to the Cu ions, the doping of the Co ions induced disorder and the localization of the charge carriers (holes) at the chain sites. These might be the reasons why the electrical resistivity of the Co doped PBCO sample increased significantly.
These results are in agreement with our previous work where the electrical resistivity increased significantly after the doping of trivalent element Ga on PBCO but only slightly increased after the doping of divalent elements Ni or Zn [14]. However, the electrical resistivities values of Co doped (110) PBCO samples were less than that of the Ga doped (110) PBCO samples, at room temperature or lower temperatures such as 77 K.
IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
We deposited epitaxial thin film of Co doped (110) PrBa_{2} Cu_{3}O_{7} (PBCCO) using the pulsed laser based thin film deposition (PLD) technique. We observed an increase of the electrical resistivity by a factor of 50 at 77 K and the occurrence of a three-dimensional variable range hopping mechanism on the (110) PBCCO thin film. The activation energies for hopping of the (110) PBCCO thin film was calculated to be 168 meV at 300 K and 75 meV at 77 K suggesting that the hopping was mainly thermally assisted.
A new Raman mode appeared at ∼620 cm^{−1} on the (110) PBCCO thin film as evidence of a broken symmetry at the Cu-O chain site due to the replacement of some of the Cu ions with the Co ions. The substitution of the Co ions with the Cu ions at the Cu-O chain sites induced disorder and localization of electronic states thereby increasing the electrical resistivity of the (110) PBCCO thin film. Because of its higher electrical resistivity than the PBCO and structural and chemical compatibility with the YBCO, we conclude that the (110)-oriented PBCCO thin film could serve as excellent insulator in high-T_{c} YBCO S-I-S tri-layer Josephson junction.
