Diversity of hysteresis in a fully cooperative coinfection model
We propose a fully cooperative coinfection model in which singly infected individuals are more likely to acquire a second disease than susceptible ones and doubly infected individuals are also assumed to be more contagious than singly infected ones. The dynamics of such a fully cooperative coinfection model is investigated through the well-mixed approach. In particular, discontinuous outbreak transitions from the disease free state or the low prevalence state to the high prevalence state can be separately observed as a disease transmission rate crosses a threshold α_{o} from the below when the epidemic is still in the early stages. Moreover, discontinuous eradications from the high prevalence state to the low prevalence or disease free state are also separately seen as the transmission rate reaches a threshold α_{e}(<α_{o}) from the above when the outbreak occurs. Such phenomena constitute three types of hysteresis, where only one type has been identified before. Complete characterization of these three types of hysteresis in terms of parameters measuring the uniformity of the model is both analytically and numerically provided.
I. INTRODUCTION
Mathematical modelling has become a fundamental tool to understand the basic features of disease spreading in a group [1,2]. We can deal with this problem with two approaches: considering a well-mixed system and approximating it with an interaction all-to-all, i.e., the mean-field approximation, or taking into account a topology that specifies who interacts with whom. Hence, the theory of both dynamic systems and complex networks [2–4] is fundamental for this kind of study. Two main compartmental models have been proposed for the dynamics of a spreading disease: one, considering three kinds of individuals, where susceptibles (S), when exposed to the disease, become infective (I) and afterwards become recovered (R), getting immunized against the disease, is known as the SIR model [5]; the other model, known as the SIS model [6], represents diseases that are spread by pathogens that frequently mutate such that individuals do not get immunized but come back to the susceptible state after the infective phase. In fact, those models have been proposed not only in the context of disease spreading but also for other spreading processes, such as computer viruses epidemics [7].
Most studies on disease spreading focus on one disease infecting a population [8–10]. However, different pathogens may interact with each other on the host. For instance, there are cases in which infection with one disease strengthens a host's immunity against other infection [11–17]. In those competitive systems, regimes such as extinction, coexistence, and one strain dominance have been identified. On the other hand, it has also been reported that people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections are more likely to get other infections such as hepatitis or tuberculosis [18–21]. Such cooperative disease spreading models have recently been studied in Refs [22–27]. Interesting dynamics, like the appearance of abrupt transitions, in contrast to the typical second order phase transition found in the single disease spreading model, have been reported [24–26]. Specifically, for SIS dynamics, there is a hysteresis behavior: In the early stages of diseases spreading when the infected population is small, the models exhibit discontinuous outbreak transition from the disease free state to the high prevalence state as a transmission rate α crosses a threshold α_{o} from the below, while in the reverse scenario, that is, when the outbreak of the diseases occurs, they exhibit discontinuous eradication transition from the high prevalence state to the disease free state as the transmission rate α reaches a threshold α_{e}(<α_{o}) from the above. The above described phase transition is to be called a hysteresis of C type [Fig. 1(a)]. The difference in α_{e} and α_{o} points out that once the outbreak of the diseases occurs, driving down the transmission rate to α_{o} is not enough to eradicate the diseases. In fact, we need to drive the rate further down to α_{e} for the epidemic to die out, which requires more effort and results in greater economic costs. Note that in the cooperative coinfection models considered in Refs [22], and  [24–26], it was only assumed that a singly infected individual is more likely to get infected with a second disease than a susceptible one.
In this work, we consider a fully cooperative coinfection model for two diseases, in which we further assume that a doubly infected individual is more contagious than a singly infected one. Our model has two stable fixed points for α_{e}<α<α_{o}, where α_{e} and α_{o} depend on other parameters of the model. Moreover, it has a unique stable fixed point whenever α<α_{e} or α>α_{o}. Specifically, to form a hysteresis of C type, the corresponding stable fixed points are the high prevalence state and the disease free state for α_{e}≤α≤α_{o}=1. To form a hysteresis of S_{l} type, we need to have a stable disease free state and a high prevalence state for α_{e}≤α≤1 and two stable endemic fixed points, i.e., high and low prevalence states, for 1≤α≤α_{o}. To have a hysteresis of S_{r} type, we need to have two stable endemic fixed points for α_{e}≤α≤α_{o}, where α_{e}>1. The last two types of hysteresis are to be further explained. Suppose that the model has discontinuous outbreak [resp. (To save space, from now on we shall write resp. as the abbreviation of respectively), eradication] transition from the low (resp., high) prevalence state to the high prevalence (resp., disease free) state as the transmission rate crosses a threshold α_{o} (resp., α_{e}) from the below (resp., above). Then, the above described phase transition is called a hysteresis of S_{l} type [Fig. 1(b)]. Moreover, suppose that a discontinuous outbreak (resp., eradication) transition from the low (resp., high) prevalence state to the high (resp., low) prevalence state can be observed as the transmission rate reaches a threshold α_{o} (resp., α_{e}) from the below (resp., above). Then, the above mentioned phase transition is called a hysteresis of S_{r} type [Fig. 1(c)]. For the single disease model, there exists only one stable fixed point. Hence, the phase transition is continuous. For the partially cooperative coinfection model such as those considered in Refs [22] and  [24–26], only the hysteresis of type C has been identified.
The organization of this paper is as follows. In Sec. II, the well-mixed approach for our fully cooperative coinfection model is introduced and analytically studied. Numerical simulation results to illustrate our main results are also provided. The effect of heterogeneity in two diseases on the corresponding model is numerically investigated in Sec. III. The summary of the main results and the concluding remarks on the future work are given in Sec. IV. All proofs of our results are given in the Appendix.
II. WELL-MIXED SYSTEM: HOMOGENEOUS CASE
We study a well-mixed particle system for the fully cooperative coinfection dynamics with two diseases, A and B. We define S, I_{A}, I_{B}, and I_{AB} as the fractions of susceptible individuals and the ones infected with diseases A, B, and AB in the population, respectively. Susceptible individuals get a primary infection from a singly infected individual carrying disease A or B with a homogenous rate α, bringing the total rate of transmission of susceptible class to 2α. Singly infected individuals with either disease A or B obtain another infection from a doubly infected individual with a higher homogeneous rate β(>α), taking the total rate of transmission of the singly infected class to 2β. It should be mentioned that simultaneous recovery from both diseases and simultaneous infection by both diseases are not considered. Moreover, the cooperation makes the doubly infected individuals more virulent in a way that they infect susceptibles (resp. singly infected) with a rate aα,a≥1 (resp. bβ,b≥1). Then, the corresponding mean field equations for this dynamic system are
Here, the homogeneous recovery rates for diseases A and B, without loss of generality, are set equal to the timescale, while the basic reaction scheme underlying the dynamic process is given in Table I. More precisely, α and aα (resp., β and bβ) are infection rates for the susceptible class (resp., singly infected class) who get infected by singly infected and doubly infected classes (resp., the complementarily infected class and doubly infected class), respectively. The quantity a (resp., b) is the ratio between the infection rates of the doubly infected class and the singly infected class for the infecting susceptible class (resp., singly infected class). The larger the a and b values are, the more contagious the doubly infected class AB is. We call a and b the relative coinfection factors for the susceptible class and the singly infected class, respectively. The quantity c:=β/α, which is termed the relative infection factor, is the ratio of the infection rates for the singly infected class and the susceptible class. The larger the c value is, the easier the singly infected class gets infected with a secondary infection. Also note that the larger the quantities a, b and c deviate from 1, the more nonuniform the model is. The case that min{a,b,c}>1 (resp., max{a,b,c}<1) corresponds to a fully cooperative (resp., competitive) coinfection model. If min{a,b,c}<1<max{a,b,c}, it is called a mixed type. In Ref [26], the authors consider a partially cooperative model, i.e., a,b=1 and c > 1, where the hysteresis of type C was found, provided that c is sufficiently large.
The dynamics of model (1) is depicted by its fixed points. Let E^{*}:=(S^{*},IA*,IB*,IAB*) be a fixed point of (1). Then, E^{*} is a nontrivial endemic fixed point, i.e., (IA*)(IB*)(IAB*)≠0, if and only if IA*=IB* (Proposition A.1 in the Appendix). To study the most interesting dynamics of the model, we consider its nontrivial endemic fixed point. Some direct computation yields that such fixed point E^{*} satisfies the following:
where S^{*}, satisfying
is a solution of
For any a,b≥1 and c > 0, Eq. (3) defines a solution curve (S,α¯(S)),0<S≤1, satisfying f(S,α¯(S))=0. In particular, for any fixed a,b≥1, c > 0, and 0<S≤1, there exists a unique positive α¯(=α¯(S)) on (0,1/S] such that f(S,α¯(S))=0 (see Proposition A.2 in the Appendix). The graph of the function α¯(S),0<S≤1 is to be studied next. We address it by making the change in the variable
Clearly, by (3)
Here, 0<T≤1. Using Proposition A.3 in the Appendix, we have that the monotonicity structure of functions α¯(S) and α̃(T) on the interval (0,1] is identical. Hence, to study the dependence of the nontrivial endemic fixed points on the parameters, it suffices to graph the function of α̃(T), which is described in Theorem 2.1. The detailed analysis of the graph of α̃(T) is provided in Proposition A.4 – A.7 in the Appendix. The stability of fixed points of system (1), stated in Theorem 2.2, is also supplied. Its proof is given at the end of the Appendix.
Theorem 2.1. For parameters a, b≥1,limT→0^{+}α̃(T)=∞ and α̃(1)=1. Define c_{2}(=c_{2}(a)) by
Then, the following assertions (I) and (II) hold.
(I) [See Figs. 2(a) and 3(a)] For b≤b_{c}(:=a+1/2),α̃(T) is concave upward on (0,1]. Moreover, the following two assertions hold.
(I-i) For c≤c_{2},α̃(T) is concave upward and strictly decreasing on (0,1]. In particular, if c = c_{2}, then α̃(T) is tangent to α = 1 at T = 1. Moreover, if we define the endemic state curve S̃ to be the corresponding curve of α̃(T) graphed on the (α,1−S) plane, then S̃ also strictly increases.
(I-ii) For c>c_{2},α̃(T) has exactly one critical point at some point T_{*} on (0, 1), which corresponds to a local minimum α_{e}(=α_{e}(c)). Moreover, α_{e}<α̃(1)(=1). Consequently, the corresponding S̃ on the (α,1−S) plane is C shaped.
(II) [See Figs. 2(b) and 3(b)] For b>b_{c}, α̃(T) has exactly one inflection point γ on (0, 1). Define c_{1}(=c_{1}(a,b)) and c_{12}(=c_{12}(a,b)), respectively, by
Here, c_{1} and c_{12} satisfy the following properties, respectively. The slope of the tangent of the corresponding curve α̃(T) at the unique inflection point γ is zero, and the corresponding curve α̃(T) is tangent to α = 1 at T_{*}, where α̃(T^{*})=α_{e}. Then, the following three assertions hold.
(II-i) For c≤c_{1},α̃(T) strictly decreases on (0,1]. Consequently, the corresponding S̃ on the (α,1−S) plane strictly increases.
(II-ii) For c_{1}<c<c_{2},α̃(T) has a unique local minimum α_{e}(=α_{e}(c)) and maximum α_{o}(=α_{o}(c)) at T_{*} and T^{*}, respectively, on (0, 1) with T_{*}<T^{*} such that α̃(T) strictly decreases on (0,T_{*}]∪[T^{*},1] while strictly increasing on (T_{*},T^{*}). Moreover
Consequently, the corresponding S̃ on the (α,1−S) plane is S shaped.
(II-iii) For c>c_{2},α̃(T) has exactly one critical point at some point T_{*} on (0, 1), which corresponds to a local minimum α_{e}(=α_{e}(c)). Moreover, α_{e}<α̃(1)(=1). Consequently, the corresponding S̃ on the (α,1−S) plane is C shaped.
Mathematically speaking, if b≤b_{c}, then α̃(T) is always concave upward regardless of the values of c [Theorem 2.1(I) and Fig. 2(a)]. Hence, as c becomes larger, α̃(T) can only change from increasing to having a local minimum [Fig. 2(a)]. The critical value for the change in the structure of the graph occurs at c = c_{2} when α̃(T) is tangent to α = 1 at T = 1. However, if b>b_{c}, then α̃(T) always has a unique inflection point on (0, 1) [Theorem 2.1(II) and Fig. 2(b)]. The structure of the graph of α̃(T) becomes more complicated as one gradually increases c [Fig. 2(b)]. Specifically, the graph of α̃(T) changes from increasing to having two local extrema to one local minimum as c gradually increases. Such a structure change occurs at c = c_{1} and c = c_{2} when the tangent to α̃(T) at the unique infection γ is horizontal and when α̃(T) is tangent to α = 1, respectively [Fig. 2(b)]. For c_{1}<c<c_{12}, the graph of the corresponding S̃ can be further distinguished into two types. In particular, we shall term the corresponding S̃ for c∈(c_{1},c_{12}) and c∈(c_{12},c_{2})S_{r} and S_{l} shaped, respectively. Such a classification is needed since C shaped, S_{r} shaped, and S_{l} shaped all have different dynamics.
Theorem 2.2. For parameters a,b≥1, the stability of fixed points of (1) is given as follows:
(i) The disease free state is locally stable (resp., unstable) provided that α≤1 (resp., α>1).
(ii) The trivial endemic fixed points, i.e., E^{*}=(1α,1−1α,0,0) or (1α,0,1−1α,0), are unstable for all α>1.
(iii) If E^{*}, a nontrivial endemic fixed point, corresponds to the point on the increasing (resp., decreasing) part of endemic state curve S̃ on the (α,1−S) plane, then it is locally stable (resp., unstable).
With the help of the stability result stated in Theorem 2.2, those three shapes of the graph as illustrated in Fig. 3 would yield three types of hysteresis loops as demonstrated in Fig. 1. In view of Theorem 2.2(iii), we need to plot Eqs. (6)–(8) to completely characterize the stabilities of S̃. To this end, we graph c_{1}(a,b),c_{12}(a,b), and c_{2}(a) with either a or b being fixed in Fig. 4. Specifically, a (resp., b) is fixed to be 1 (resp., 3) in Fig. 4(a) [resp., Fig. 4(b)]. Both the (b, c) and (a, c) planes are divided into four parts, strictly increasing, C shaped, S_{l} shaped, and S_{r} shaped, according to the results stated in Theorem 2.1(I) and (II). Furthermore, it then follows from Theorem 2.2 that the dynamics of the model with parameters chosen from those four parts can also be completely understood. Specifically, those four parts indicated above would yield the following dynamics: a continuous transition, hysteresis loops of C type, S_{l} type, and S_{r} type, respectively. Note that a, b, and c are the measurement for the degree of uniformity in the coinfection model. The assumptions that 1≤b≤b_{c} and c≤c_{2} or b>b_{c} and c≤c_{1} indicate that the model under consideration is relatively uniform. Such a model exhibits a continuous transition at α = 1, the same threshold as the single disease spreading according to the SIS model. In short, for such a system, it acts as non-interacting. If the relative infection factor c is large, more precisely c>c_{2}, then the model exhibits the hysteresis of C type regardless of what relative coinfection factors a and b are. If the difference in relative coinfection factors a and b is large, i.e., b>b_{c}, then hysteresis behavior will occur with smaller c as compared to the case that b≤b_{c}. In particular, if c is between c_{1} and c_{2}, then hysteresis of S_{r} or S_{l} type occurs. In summary, we see that the nonuniformity of the model is what drives the occurrence of the hysteresis.
The assumption in Theorem 2.2 is that a, b≥1. However, to apply the results in Theorem 2.2, c is not required to be not smaller than one. So, we shall also explore the dynamics of (1) under a particular mixed type, i.e., a, b≥1 and c≤1. We see, via Figs. 5 and 6, that three types of hysteresis still exist, provided that the model is extremely nonuniform. For instance, with (b,c)=(25.5,0.082), by increasing the nonuniformity measurement in a, we see that the model goes through the following phase transitions: continuous phase transition to hysteresis of S_{r} type to continuous phase transition to hysteresis of S_{r} type to hysteresis of S_{l} type to hysteresis of C type. We end this section by giving the following observations:
(A) If the devastation caused by the diseases is measured by how large the size of infected population jumps in the outbreak and by how much effort needed to eradicate the diseases, then hysteresis of C (resp., S_{r}) type is the most (resp., least) devastating.
(B) The most interesting case, where b>b_{c}, exhibits four different regimes in the parameter space [Theorem 2.1, Figs. 4(a) and 4(b)]. Those behaviours can be understood by taking into account the microscopic features of the dynamics. In this situation, the cooperation mainly comes through state AB, which is considerably more virulent (Table I). First, in the case that the value of c is small, there are not enough AB states at the transition point in which the disease breaks out, and so, the transition is continuous. Moreover, enough AB states appear only when the system is already in a state with most of the nodes infected. This makes the effect on cooperation small, and hence, we have a continuous branch. If the value of c is further increased, the appearance of more AB states is stimulated. Eventually, in the case that enough AB states appear after a threshold α_{o}, which is greater than the point for the outbreak of diseases, is reached, cooperation for doubly infected AB infecting other states starts to be effective, and then, an abrupt transition emerges. Finally, if we keep on increasing c, the cooperation for secondary infection dominates the dynamics and the model matches the results reported in Ref [26].
(C) In the case that the relative infection factor a for the susceptible class is relatively high than that of b for the singly infected class, or equivalently, b≤a+1/2, there exist only two different regimes in the parameter space. The empirical reason for the disappearance of S_{r} and S_{l} shapes is due to the fact that a higher a coupled with a larger c would simulate enough states AB at the transition point where the disease breaks out. Consequently, an abrupt transmission emerges.
III. WELL-MIXED SYSTEM: HETEROGENEOUS CASE
In this section, we incorporate the heterogeneity in two diseases, i.e., different infection rates for the two diseases while keeping the same recovering rates. For simplicity, we assume that those infection rates for both diseases satisfy the following α_{B}/α_{A}=β_{B}/β_{A}≡d. Here, d is a nonnegative real number. For d > 1 (resp., 0<d<1), we increase (decrease) the infection rate of disease B by a factor d. The equations defining the heterogeneous system are
To understand the dynamics of system (10), we first need to find an equation satisfied by S. Here, E=(S,I_{A},I_{B},I_{AB}) is a fixed point of (10). In the homogeneous case, such an equation, given in (3), is a polynomial of degree 3 in α and S. For the heterogeneous case, such an equation is a polynomial equation of degree 5 in α_{A} and S, requiring more than a page to write it down (see supplementary material). This, in turn, makes the theoretical study of the dynamics of system (10) a daunting task. Hence, all the conclusions in this section are drawn from simulations and empirical evidences.
Our aim in this section is to understand how the measurement d of heterogeneity in two diseases affects the dynamics of this model. To this end, we set (a,b,c)=(1,2,2.03) and then numerically solve the α_{A} in terms of S. We then graph the resulting pair (S,α_{A}(S)) in the (α_{A},1−S) plane for various choices of d. Such a graph is denoted by Γ_{d}, where d > 0 [Figs. 7(a) and 7(b)]. Denote by ℓ_{d}: 1−S=1−1dα_{A}, where α_{A}≥1d. For any d > 0, ℓ_{1} corresponds to the set of all feasible trivial epidemic states E_{A}=(1α_{A},1−1α_{A},0,0), while ℓ_{d} is the set of all feasible epidemic states E_{B}=(1dα_{A},0,1−1dα_{A},0). Note that the graph of ℓ_{1} lies above (resp., below) ℓ_{d} whenever 0<d<1 (resp., d > 1). Hence, it is reasonable to expect that the portion of Γ_{d} lying on or above ℓ_{1} (resp., ℓ_{d}) consists of feasible epidemic states whenever 0<d<1 (resp., d > 1). On the other hand, for 0<d<1, the portion of Γ_{d} lying below ℓ_{1} consists of infeasible epidemic states. Specifically, the states of I_{B} associated with that portion of Γ_{d} will become negative. Similarly, if d > 1, then the portion of Γ_{d} lying below ℓ_{d} has the state of I_{A} to be negative. From here on, Γ_{d} [Figs. 7(a) and 7(b)] shall be referred to as its feasible part. In fact, Γ_{d} is made up of the nontrivial epidemic states except at the interception point H of Γ_{d}∩ℓ_{d}, where, in case that 0<d<1,ℓ_{d} is to be interpreted as ℓ_{1}. The α-coordinate of H is to be denoted by α_{d}. For each d > 0, the threshold for a discontinuous outbreak transition is denoted by α_{d,o}.
In view of the shape of Γ_{d}∪ℓ_{d} [Figs. 7(a) and 7(b)], we conjecture that the following hold true. (i) For 0<d<1, the portion, denoted by ℓ_{d,A}, of ℓ_{1} with 1≤α_{A}≤α_{d} (resp., α_{A}>α_{d}) is stable (resp., unstable). Similarly, for d > 1, the portion, denoted by ℓ_{d,B}, of ℓ_{d} with 1d≤α_{A}≤α_{d} (resp., α_{A}>α_{d}) is stable (resp., unstable). (ii) Define d_{−k}=1d_{k}. For d_{8}≈0.602<d<1 (resp., d_{−8}>d>1), the corresponding epidemic states consist of two (solid) stable branches connected by a dotted unstable branch. The upper stable branch is only made up of nontrivial epidemic states. However, what the lower stable branch is made up of depends on d. In particular, for 1>d≥d_{4}≈0.624 and 1<d≤d_{−4}≈1.647, the corresponding lower stable branch consists of disease free states (0<α_{A}≤1 and 0<α_{A}≤1d) and trivial epidemic states (1<α_{A}≤α_{d} and 1d<α_{A}≤α_{d}). In the above ranges of d, we have that α_{d,o}=α_{d}. For d_{8}<d≤d_{4} and d_{−8}>d≥d_{−4}, its lower stable branch is made up of disease free states (0<α_{A}≤1 and 0<α_{A}≤1d), trivial epidemic states (1<α_{A}≤α_{d} and 1d<α_{A}≤α_{d}), and nontrivial epidemic states (α_{d}<α_{A}≤α_{d,o}). (iii) For 0<d≤d_{8} and d≥d_{−8}, the unstable branch disappears and two stable branches merge, which make system (10) noninteracting. In summary, the differences in dynamics between homogeneous and heterogeneous models stem from the fact that trivial epidemic states of the former remain unstable for all α≥1, while the trivial epidemic states of the later growing initially from disease free states must be stable.
To verify the stability of each branch, we set additionally d=d_{5}=0.615 or d=d_{−3}=54 and start out with two sets of initial conditions: (I_{A}(0),I_{B}(0),I_{AB}(0))=(0.005,0.005,0) and (I_{A}(0),I_{B}(0),I_{AB}(0))=(0.4,0.4,0.1), which correspond to the early stage of epidemic and the outbreak of the diseases, respectively. We then integrate system (10) and report the converging values for the initial values. The corresponding eventual states, stopped at t=10^{4}, are marked by circles and crosses, respectively, which match quite well with predicted stable branches [Fig. 7(a)]. In any event, we see, via Figs. 7(a) and 7(b), that the threshold α_{d,o} for a discontinuous outbreak transition will increase (resp., decrease) as d gradually decreases (resp., increases) from one. The empirical explanations of the above phenomena are to be explained in the next paragraph.
For a homogeneous coinfection model, i.e., d = 1 and (a,b,c)=(1,2,2.03), both diseases are at the cusp of having stable infected population when α_{A}=α_{B}=1, which is also when the cooperation of two diseases is at its full strength. Hence, as α races pass one, the discontinuous jump of infected population, which forms a hysteresis loop of type C, can be seen. However, for d < 1, due to the heterogeneity in two diseases, disease A is ready to produce stable infected population at α_{A}=1, while disease B is not. Hence, to have a sudden jump in the infected population, disease A has to produce more stable infected population so that the infected population for disease B can be stabilized due to their cooperation. Once both diseases can produce stabilized infected population, a discontinuous jump in the total infected population can then be observed. As the imbalance of the transmission rates between two diseases grows, i.e., d becomes smaller, disease A needs to produce even a greater number of infected population in order to generate stable infected population for disease B. Specifically, if 1≥d>d_{4}, then the discontinuous jump occurs at α_{d,o}=α_{d}, see, e.g., Γ_{d1},Γ_{d2},Γ_{d3} in Fig. 7(a). For d_{8}<d<d_{4}, meaning that the infection rate for disease B is further weaken, the discontinuous jump has to further wait until the nontrivial epidemic states can also be stabilized. Similar empirical interpretations can then be given for d > 1. In fact, if we switch the labels of diseases A and B in Eq. (10), then the corresponding ratios of α_{B}/α_{A} and β_{B}/β_{A} become 1/d. That is to say, system (10) with d > 1 and 0<d<1 is mathematically equivalent.
One final remark about the heterogeneity in two diseases is that the hysteresis loop of C shaped completely disappears whenever d≠1. Such an observation is based on the conjecture (i) mentioned earlier and in Figs. 7(a) and 7(b).
IV. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we propose a fully cooperative coinfection model, which is investigated through the well-mixed approach. We prove analytically that the model exhibits three types of hysteresis, provided that the model is relatively nonuniform in its parameters. In particular, we prove that discontinuous outbreak transitions from the disease free or low prevalence state to the high prevalence state can be separately observed as a disease transmission rate crosses a threshold α_{o} from the below when the epidemic is still in the early stages and that discontinuous eradications from the high prevalence state to the low prevalence or disease free state are also separately seen as the transition rate reaches a threshold to α_{e}(<α_{o}) from the above when the outbreak occurs. Such phenomena are sharply in contrast to a single disease model which only exhibits a continuous transition. Moreover, the results also highlight the importance of preventing the outbreak of disease since it would then take greater effort to eradicate it.
The effect of heterogeneity in two diseases observed in Sec. III is based on simulations. It is, therefore, valuable to analytically verify the results mentioned there. It is of great interest to study the effect of vaccination and awareness on such a fully cooperative coinfection model. The network based approach for coinfection models with or without delay is also worthwhile to pursue.
V. SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL
Characterizing the behavior of multi-disease or multi-strain models is important to address some relevant issues in biology and ecology. This topic is becoming more and more relevant for the community of infectious disease modellers, mathematical biologists, and complex system scholars in general. In this work, we study the dynamics of an epidemic model of two interacting diseases where infection status is not mutually exclusive and spread of both diseases is enhanced when they are infecting a single individual. In particular, the model can undergo three types of hysteresis, indicating the discontinuous phase transitions from the disease-free state or the low prevalence state to the high prevalence state and from the high prevalence state to the low prevalence state or the disease free state. Such phenomena are sharply in contrast to a single disease model which only exhibits a continuous transition. Moreover, the results also highlight the importance of preventing the outbreak of disease since it would then take greater effort to eradicate it.
Mathematical modelling has become a fundamental tool to understand the basic features of disease spreading in a group [1,2]. We can deal with this problem with two approaches: considering a well-mixed system and approximating it with an interaction all-to-all, i.e., the mean-field approximation, or taking into account a topology that specifies who interacts with whom. Hence, the theory of both dynamic systems and complex networks [2–4] is fundamental for this kind of study. Two main compartmental models have been proposed for the dynamics of a spreading disease: one, considering three kinds of individuals, where susceptibles (S), when exposed to the disease, become infective (I) and afterwards become recovered (R), getting immunized against the disease, is known as the SIR model [5]; the other model, known as the SIS model [6], represents diseases that are spread by pathogens that frequently mutate such that individuals do not get immunized but come back to the susceptible state after the infective phase. In fact, those models have been proposed not only in the context of disease spreading but also for other spreading processes, such as computer viruses epidemics [7].
Most studies on disease spreading focus on one disease infecting a population [8–10]. However, different pathogens may interact with each other on the host. For instance, there are cases in which infection with one disease strengthens a host's immunity against other infection [11–17]. In those competitive systems, regimes such as extinction, coexistence, and one strain dominance have been identified. On the other hand, it has also been reported that people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections are more likely to get other infections such as hepatitis or tuberculosis [18–21]. Such cooperative disease spreading models have recently been studied in Refs [22–27]. Interesting dynamics, like the appearance of abrupt transitions, in contrast to the typical second order phase transition found in the single disease spreading model, have been reported [24–26]. Specifically, for SIS dynamics, there is a hysteresis behavior: In the early stages of diseases spreading when the infected population is small, the models exhibit discontinuous outbreak transition from the disease free state to the high prevalence state as a transmission rate α crosses a threshold α_{o} from the below, while in the reverse scenario, that is, when the outbreak of the diseases occurs, they exhibit discontinuous eradication transition from the high prevalence state to the disease free state as the transmission rate α reaches a threshold α_{e}(<α_{o}) from the above. The above described phase transition is to be called a hysteresis of C type [Fig. 1(a)]. The difference in α_{e} and α_{o} points out that once the outbreak of the diseases occurs, driving down the transmission rate to α_{o} is not enough to eradicate the diseases. In fact, we need to drive the rate further down to α_{e} for the epidemic to die out, which requires more effort and results in greater economic costs. Note that in the cooperative coinfection models considered in Refs [22], and  [24–26], it was only assumed that a singly infected individual is more likely to get infected with a second disease than a susceptible one.
In this work, we consider a fully cooperative coinfection model for two diseases, in which we further assume that a doubly infected individual is more contagious than a singly infected one. Our model has two stable fixed points for α_{e}<α<α_{o}, where α_{e} and α_{o} depend on other parameters of the model. Moreover, it has a unique stable fixed point whenever α<α_{e} or α>α_{o}. Specifically, to form a hysteresis of C type, the corresponding stable fixed points are the high prevalence state and the disease free state for α_{e}≤α≤α_{o}=1. To form a hysteresis of S_{l} type, we need to have a stable disease free state and a high prevalence state for α_{e}≤α≤1 and two stable endemic fixed points, i.e., high and low prevalence states, for 1≤α≤α_{o}. To have a hysteresis of S_{r} type, we need to have two stable endemic fixed points for α_{e}≤α≤α_{o}, where α_{e}>1. The last two types of hysteresis are to be further explained. Suppose that the model has discontinuous outbreak [resp. (To save space, from now on we shall write resp. as the abbreviation of respectively), eradication] transition from the low (resp., high) prevalence state to the high prevalence (resp., disease free) state as the transmission rate crosses a threshold α_{o} (resp., α_{e}) from the below (resp., above). Then, the above described phase transition is called a hysteresis of S_{l} type [Fig. 1(b)]. Moreover, suppose that a discontinuous outbreak (resp., eradication) transition from the low (resp., high) prevalence state to the high (resp., low) prevalence state can be observed as the transmission rate reaches a threshold α_{o} (resp., α_{e}) from the below (resp., above). Then, the above mentioned phase transition is called a hysteresis of S_{r} type [Fig. 1(c)]. For the single disease model, there exists only one stable fixed point. Hence, the phase transition is continuous. For the partially cooperative coinfection model such as those considered in Refs [22] and  [24–26], only the hysteresis of type C has been identified.
The organization of this paper is as follows. In Sec. II, the well-mixed approach for our fully cooperative coinfection model is introduced and analytically studied. Numerical simulation results to illustrate our main results are also provided. The effect of heterogeneity in two diseases on the corresponding model is numerically investigated in Sec. III. The summary of the main results and the concluding remarks on the future work are given in Sec. IV. All proofs of our results are given in the Appendix.
We study a well-mixed particle system for the fully cooperative coinfection dynamics with two diseases, A and B. We define S, I_{A}, I_{B}, and I_{AB} as the fractions of susceptible individuals and the ones infected with diseases A, B, and AB in the population, respectively. Susceptible individuals get a primary infection from a singly infected individual carrying disease A or B with a homogenous rate α, bringing the total rate of transmission of susceptible class to 2α. Singly infected individuals with either disease A or B obtain another infection from a doubly infected individual with a higher homogeneous rate β(>α), taking the total rate of transmission of the singly infected class to 2β. It should be mentioned that simultaneous recovery from both diseases and simultaneous infection by both diseases are not considered. Moreover, the cooperation makes the doubly infected individuals more virulent in a way that they infect susceptibles (resp. singly infected) with a rate aα,a≥1 (resp. bβ,b≥1). Then, the corresponding mean field equations for this dynamic system are
Here, the homogeneous recovery rates for diseases A and B, without loss of generality, are set equal to the timescale, while the basic reaction scheme underlying the dynamic process is given in Table I. More precisely, α and aα (resp., β and bβ) are infection rates for the susceptible class (resp., singly infected class) who get infected by singly infected and doubly infected classes (resp., the complementarily infected class and doubly infected class), respectively. The quantity a (resp., b) is the ratio between the infection rates of the doubly infected class and the singly infected class for the infecting susceptible class (resp., singly infected class). The larger the a and b values are, the more contagious the doubly infected class AB is. We call a and b the relative coinfection factors for the susceptible class and the singly infected class, respectively. The quantity c:=β/α, which is termed the relative infection factor, is the ratio of the infection rates for the singly infected class and the susceptible class. The larger the c value is, the easier the singly infected class gets infected with a secondary infection. Also note that the larger the quantities a, b and c deviate from 1, the more nonuniform the model is. The case that min{a,b,c}>1 (resp., max{a,b,c}<1) corresponds to a fully cooperative (resp., competitive) coinfection model. If min{a,b,c}<1<max{a,b,c}, it is called a mixed type. In Ref [26], the authors consider a partially cooperative model, i.e., a,b=1 and c > 1, where the hysteresis of type C was found, provided that c is sufficiently large.
The dynamics of model (1) is depicted by its fixed points. Let E^{*}:=(S^{*},IA*,IB*,IAB*) be a fixed point of (1). Then, E^{*} is a nontrivial endemic fixed point, i.e., (IA*)(IB*)(IAB*)≠0, if and only if IA*=IB* (Proposition A.1 in the Appendix). To study the most interesting dynamics of the model, we consider its nontrivial endemic fixed point. Some direct computation yields that such fixed point E^{*} satisfies the following:
where S^{*}, satisfying
is a solution of
For any a,b≥1 and c > 0, Eq. (3) defines a solution curve (S,α¯(S)),0<S≤1, satisfying f(S,α¯(S))=0. In particular, for any fixed a,b≥1, c > 0, and 0<S≤1, there exists a unique positive α¯(=α¯(S)) on (0,1/S] such that f(S,α¯(S))=0 (see Proposition A.2 in the Appendix). The graph of the function α¯(S),0<S≤1 is to be studied next. We address it by making the change in the variable
Clearly, by (3)
Here, 0<T≤1. Using Proposition A.3 in the Appendix, we have that the monotonicity structure of functions α¯(S) and α̃(T) on the interval (0,1] is identical. Hence, to study the dependence of the nontrivial endemic fixed points on the parameters, it suffices to graph the function of α̃(T), which is described in Theorem 2.1. The detailed analysis of the graph of α̃(T) is provided in Proposition A.4 – A.7 in the Appendix. The stability of fixed points of system (1), stated in Theorem 2.2, is also supplied. Its proof is given at the end of the Appendix.
Theorem 2.1. For parameters a, b≥1,limT→0^{+}α̃(T)=∞ and α̃(1)=1. Define c_{2}(=c_{2}(a)) by
Then, the following assertions (I) and (II) hold.
(I) [See Figs. 2(a) and 3(a)] For b≤b_{c}(:=a+1/2),α̃(T) is concave upward on (0,1]. Moreover, the following two assertions hold.
(I-i) For c≤c_{2},α̃(T) is concave upward and strictly decreasing on (0,1]. In particular, if c = c_{2}, then α̃(T) is tangent to α = 1 at T = 1. Moreover, if we define the endemic state curve S̃ to be the corresponding curve of α̃(T) graphed on the (α,1−S) plane, then S̃ also strictly increases.
(I-ii) For c>c_{2},α̃(T) has exactly one critical point at some point T_{*} on (0, 1), which corresponds to a local minimum α_{e}(=α_{e}(c)). Moreover, α_{e}<α̃(1)(=1). Consequently, the corresponding S̃ on the (α,1−S) plane is C shaped.
(II) [See Figs. 2(b) and 3(b)] For b>b_{c}, α̃(T) has exactly one inflection point γ on (0, 1). Define c_{1}(=c_{1}(a,b)) and c_{12}(=c_{12}(a,b)), respectively, by
Here, c_{1} and c_{12} satisfy the following properties, respectively. The slope of the tangent of the corresponding curve α̃(T) at the unique inflection point γ is zero, and the corresponding curve α̃(T) is tangent to α = 1 at T_{*}, where α̃(T^{*})=α_{e}. Then, the following three assertions hold.
(II-i) For c≤c_{1},α̃(T) strictly decreases on (0,1]. Consequently, the corresponding S̃ on the (α,1−S) plane strictly increases.
(II-ii) For c_{1}<c<c_{2},α̃(T) has a unique local minimum α_{e}(=α_{e}(c)) and maximum α_{o}(=α_{o}(c)) at T_{*} and T^{*}, respectively, on (0, 1) with T_{*}<T^{*} such that α̃(T) strictly decreases on (0,T_{*}]∪[T^{*},1] while strictly increasing on (T_{*},T^{*}). Moreover
Consequently, the corresponding S̃ on the (α,1−S) plane is S shaped.
(II-iii) For c>c_{2},α̃(T) has exactly one critical point at some point T_{*} on (0, 1), which corresponds to a local minimum α_{e}(=α_{e}(c)). Moreover, α_{e}<α̃(1)(=1). Consequently, the corresponding S̃ on the (α,1−S) plane is C shaped.
[See Figs. 2(a) and 3(a)] For b≤b_{c}(:=a+1/2),α̃(T) is concave upward on (0,1]. Moreover, the following two assertions hold.
For c≤c_{2},α̃(T) is concave upward and strictly decreasing on (0,1]. In particular, if c = c_{2}, then α̃(T) is tangent to α = 1 at T = 1. Moreover, if we define the endemic state curve S̃ to be the corresponding curve of α̃(T) graphed on the (α,1−S) plane, then S̃ also strictly increases.
For c>c_{2},α̃(T) has exactly one critical point at some point T_{*} on (0, 1), which corresponds to a local minimum α_{e}(=α_{e}(c)). Moreover, α_{e}<α̃(1)(=1). Consequently, the corresponding S̃ on the (α,1−S) plane is C shaped.
[See Figs. 2(b) and 3(b)] For b>b_{c}, α̃(T) has exactly one inflection point γ on (0, 1). Define c_{1}(=c_{1}(a,b)) and c_{12}(=c_{12}(a,b)), respectively, by
Here, c_{1} and c_{12} satisfy the following properties, respectively. The slope of the tangent of the corresponding curve α̃(T) at the unique inflection point γ is zero, and the corresponding curve α̃(T) is tangent to α = 1 at T_{*}, where α̃(T^{*})=α_{e}. Then, the following three assertions hold.
For c≤c_{1},α̃(T) strictly decreases on (0,1]. Consequently, the corresponding S̃ on the (α,1−S) plane strictly increases.
For c_{1}<c<c_{2},α̃(T) has a unique local minimum α_{e}(=α_{e}(c)) and maximum α_{o}(=α_{o}(c)) at T_{*} and T^{*}, respectively, on (0, 1) with T_{*}<T^{*} such that α̃(T) strictly decreases on (0,T_{*}]∪[T^{*},1] while strictly increasing on (T_{*},T^{*}). Moreover
Consequently, the corresponding S̃ on the (α,1−S) plane is S shaped.
For c>c_{2},α̃(T) has exactly one critical point at some point T_{*} on (0, 1), which corresponds to a local minimum α_{e}(=α_{e}(c)). Moreover, α_{e}<α̃(1)(=1). Consequently, the corresponding S̃ on the (α,1−S) plane is C shaped.
Mathematically speaking, if b≤b_{c}, then α̃(T) is always concave upward regardless of the values of c [Theorem 2.1(I) and Fig. 2(a)]. Hence, as c becomes larger, α̃(T) can only change from increasing to having a local minimum [Fig. 2(a)]. The critical value for the change in the structure of the graph occurs at c = c_{2} when α̃(T) is tangent to α = 1 at T = 1. However, if b>b_{c}, then α̃(T) always has a unique inflection point on (0, 1) [Theorem 2.1(II) and Fig. 2(b)]. The structure of the graph of α̃(T) becomes more complicated as one gradually increases c [Fig. 2(b)]. Specifically, the graph of α̃(T) changes from increasing to having two local extrema to one local minimum as c gradually increases. Such a structure change occurs at c = c_{1} and c = c_{2} when the tangent to α̃(T) at the unique infection γ is horizontal and when α̃(T) is tangent to α = 1, respectively [Fig. 2(b)]. For c_{1}<c<c_{12}, the graph of the corresponding S̃ can be further distinguished into two types. In particular, we shall term the corresponding S̃ for c∈(c_{1},c_{12}) and c∈(c_{12},c_{2})S_{r} and S_{l} shaped, respectively. Such a classification is needed since C shaped, S_{r} shaped, and S_{l} shaped all have different dynamics.
Theorem 2.2. For parameters a,b≥1, the stability of fixed points of (1) is given as follows:
(i) The disease free state is locally stable (resp., unstable) provided that α≤1 (resp., α>1).
(ii) The trivial endemic fixed points, i.e., E^{*}=(1α,1−1α,0,0) or (1α,0,1−1α,0), are unstable for all α>1.
(iii) If E^{*}, a nontrivial endemic fixed point, corresponds to the point on the increasing (resp., decreasing) part of endemic state curve S̃ on the (α,1−S) plane, then it is locally stable (resp., unstable).
The disease free state is locally stable (resp., unstable) provided that α≤1 (resp., α>1).
The trivial endemic fixed points, i.e., E^{*}=(1α,1−1α,0,0) or (1α,0,1−1α,0), are unstable for all α>1.
If E^{*}, a nontrivial endemic fixed point, corresponds to the point on the increasing (resp., decreasing) part of endemic state curve S̃ on the (α,1−S) plane, then it is locally stable (resp., unstable).
With the help of the stability result stated in Theorem 2.2, those three shapes of the graph as illustrated in Fig. 3 would yield three types of hysteresis loops as demonstrated in Fig. 1. In view of Theorem 2.2(iii), we need to plot Eqs. (6)–(8) to completely characterize the stabilities of S̃. To this end, we graph c_{1}(a,b),c_{12}(a,b), and c_{2}(a) with either a or b being fixed in Fig. 4. Specifically, a (resp., b) is fixed to be 1 (resp., 3) in Fig. 4(a) [resp., Fig. 4(b)]. Both the (b, c) and (a, c) planes are divided into four parts, strictly increasing, C shaped, S_{l} shaped, and S_{r} shaped, according to the results stated in Theorem 2.1(I) and (II). Furthermore, it then follows from Theorem 2.2 that the dynamics of the model with parameters chosen from those four parts can also be completely understood. Specifically, those four parts indicated above would yield the following dynamics: a continuous transition, hysteresis loops of C type, S_{l} type, and S_{r} type, respectively. Note that a, b, and c are the measurement for the degree of uniformity in the coinfection model. The assumptions that 1≤b≤b_{c} and c≤c_{2} or b>b_{c} and c≤c_{1} indicate that the model under consideration is relatively uniform. Such a model exhibits a continuous transition at α = 1, the same threshold as the single disease spreading according to the SIS model. In short, for such a system, it acts as non-interacting. If the relative infection factor c is large, more precisely c>c_{2}, then the model exhibits the hysteresis of C type regardless of what relative coinfection factors a and b are. If the difference in relative coinfection factors a and b is large, i.e., b>b_{c}, then hysteresis behavior will occur with smaller c as compared to the case that b≤b_{c}. In particular, if c is between c_{1} and c_{2}, then hysteresis of S_{r} or S_{l} type occurs. In summary, we see that the nonuniformity of the model is what drives the occurrence of the hysteresis.
The assumption in Theorem 2.2 is that a, b≥1. However, to apply the results in Theorem 2.2, c is not required to be not smaller than one. So, we shall also explore the dynamics of (1) under a particular mixed type, i.e., a, b≥1 and c≤1. We see, via Figs. 5 and 6, that three types of hysteresis still exist, provided that the model is extremely nonuniform. For instance, with (b,c)=(25.5,0.082), by increasing the nonuniformity measurement in a, we see that the model goes through the following phase transitions: continuous phase transition to hysteresis of S_{r} type to continuous phase transition to hysteresis of S_{r} type to hysteresis of S_{l} type to hysteresis of C type. We end this section by giving the following observations:
(A) If the devastation caused by the diseases is measured by how large the size of infected population jumps in the outbreak and by how much effort needed to eradicate the diseases, then hysteresis of C (resp., S_{r}) type is the most (resp., least) devastating.
(B) The most interesting case, where b>b_{c}, exhibits four different regimes in the parameter space [Theorem 2.1, Figs. 4(a) and 4(b)]. Those behaviours can be understood by taking into account the microscopic features of the dynamics. In this situation, the cooperation mainly comes through state AB, which is considerably more virulent (Table I). First, in the case that the value of c is small, there are not enough AB states at the transition point in which the disease breaks out, and so, the transition is continuous. Moreover, enough AB states appear only when the system is already in a state with most of the nodes infected. This makes the effect on cooperation small, and hence, we have a continuous branch. If the value of c is further increased, the appearance of more AB states is stimulated. Eventually, in the case that enough AB states appear after a threshold α_{o}, which is greater than the point for the outbreak of diseases, is reached, cooperation for doubly infected AB infecting other states starts to be effective, and then, an abrupt transition emerges. Finally, if we keep on increasing c, the cooperation for secondary infection dominates the dynamics and the model matches the results reported in Ref [26].
(C) In the case that the relative infection factor a for the susceptible class is relatively high than that of b for the singly infected class, or equivalently, b≤a+1/2, there exist only two different regimes in the parameter space. The empirical reason for the disappearance of S_{r} and S_{l} shapes is due to the fact that a higher a coupled with a larger c would simulate enough states AB at the transition point where the disease breaks out. Consequently, an abrupt transmission emerges.

In this section, we incorporate the heterogeneity in two diseases, i.e., different infection rates for the two diseases while keeping the same recovering rates. For simplicity, we assume that those infection rates for both diseases satisfy the following α_{B}/α_{A}=β_{B}/β_{A}≡d. Here, d is a nonnegative real number. For d > 1 (resp., 0<d<1), we increase (decrease) the infection rate of disease B by a factor d. The equations defining the heterogeneous system are
To understand the dynamics of system (10), we first need to find an equation satisfied by S. Here, E=(S,I_{A},I_{B},I_{AB}) is a fixed point of (10). In the homogeneous case, such an equation, given in (3), is a polynomial of degree 3 in α and S. For the heterogeneous case, such an equation is a polynomial equation of degree 5 in α_{A} and S, requiring more than a page to write it down (see supplementary material). This, in turn, makes the theoretical study of the dynamics of system (10) a daunting task. Hence, all the conclusions in this section are drawn from simulations and empirical evidences.
Our aim in this section is to understand how the measurement d of heterogeneity in two diseases affects the dynamics of this model. To this end, we set (a,b,c)=(1,2,2.03) and then numerically solve the α_{A} in terms of S. We then graph the resulting pair (S,α_{A}(S)) in the (α_{A},1−S) plane for various choices of d. Such a graph is denoted by Γ_{d}, where d > 0 [Figs. 7(a) and 7(b)]. Denote by ℓ_{d}: 1−S=1−1dα_{A}, where α_{A}≥1d. For any d > 0, ℓ_{1} corresponds to the set of all feasible trivial epidemic states E_{A}=(1α_{A},1−1α_{A},0,0), while ℓ_{d} is the set of all feasible epidemic states E_{B}=(1dα_{A},0,1−1dα_{A},0). Note that the graph of ℓ_{1} lies above (resp., below) ℓ_{d} whenever 0<d<1 (resp., d > 1). Hence, it is reasonable to expect that the portion of Γ_{d} lying on or above ℓ_{1} (resp., ℓ_{d}) consists of feasible epidemic states whenever 0<d<1 (resp., d > 1). On the other hand, for 0<d<1, the portion of Γ_{d} lying below ℓ_{1} consists of infeasible epidemic states. Specifically, the states of I_{B} associated with that portion of Γ_{d} will become negative. Similarly, if d > 1, then the portion of Γ_{d} lying below ℓ_{d} has the state of I_{A} to be negative. From here on, Γ_{d} [Figs. 7(a) and 7(b)] shall be referred to as its feasible part. In fact, Γ_{d} is made up of the nontrivial epidemic states except at the interception point H of Γ_{d}∩ℓ_{d}, where, in case that 0<d<1,ℓ_{d} is to be interpreted as ℓ_{1}. The α-coordinate of H is to be denoted by α_{d}. For each d > 0, the threshold for a discontinuous outbreak transition is denoted by α_{d,o}.
In view of the shape of Γ_{d}∪ℓ_{d} [Figs. 7(a) and 7(b)], we conjecture that the following hold true. (i) For 0<d<1, the portion, denoted by ℓ_{d,A}, of ℓ_{1} with 1≤α_{A}≤α_{d} (resp., α_{A}>α_{d}) is stable (resp., unstable). Similarly, for d > 1, the portion, denoted by ℓ_{d,B}, of ℓ_{d} with 1d≤α_{A}≤α_{d} (resp., α_{A}>α_{d}) is stable (resp., unstable). (ii) Define d_{−k}=1d_{k}. For d_{8}≈0.602<d<1 (resp., d_{−8}>d>1), the corresponding epidemic states consist of two (solid) stable branches connected by a dotted unstable branch. The upper stable branch is only made up of nontrivial epidemic states. However, what the lower stable branch is made up of depends on d. In particular, for 1>d≥d_{4}≈0.624 and 1<d≤d_{−4}≈1.647, the corresponding lower stable branch consists of disease free states (0<α_{A}≤1 and 0<α_{A}≤1d) and trivial epidemic states (1<α_{A}≤α_{d} and 1d<α_{A}≤α_{d}). In the above ranges of d, we have that α_{d,o}=α_{d}. For d_{8}<d≤d_{4} and d_{−8}>d≥d_{−4}, its lower stable branch is made up of disease free states (0<α_{A}≤1 and 0<α_{A}≤1d), trivial epidemic states (1<α_{A}≤α_{d} and 1d<α_{A}≤α_{d}), and nontrivial epidemic states (α_{d}<α_{A}≤α_{d,o}). (iii) For 0<d≤d_{8} and d≥d_{−8}, the unstable branch disappears and two stable branches merge, which make system (10) noninteracting. In summary, the differences in dynamics between homogeneous and heterogeneous models stem from the fact that trivial epidemic states of the former remain unstable for all α≥1, while the trivial epidemic states of the later growing initially from disease free states must be stable.
To verify the stability of each branch, we set additionally d=d_{5}=0.615 or d=d_{−3}=54 and start out with two sets of initial conditions: (I_{A}(0),I_{B}(0),I_{AB}(0))=(0.005,0.005,0) and (I_{A}(0),I_{B}(0),I_{AB}(0))=(0.4,0.4,0.1), which correspond to the early stage of epidemic and the outbreak of the diseases, respectively. We then integrate system (10) and report the converging values for the initial values. The corresponding eventual states, stopped at t=10^{4}, are marked by circles and crosses, respectively, which match quite well with predicted stable branches [Fig. 7(a)]. In any event, we see, via Figs. 7(a) and 7(b), that the threshold α_{d,o} for a discontinuous outbreak transition will increase (resp., decrease) as d gradually decreases (resp., increases) from one. The empirical explanations of the above phenomena are to be explained in the next paragraph.
For a homogeneous coinfection model, i.e., d = 1 and (a,b,c)=(1,2,2.03), both diseases are at the cusp of having stable infected population when α_{A}=α_{B}=1, which is also when the cooperation of two diseases is at its full strength. Hence, as α races pass one, the discontinuous jump of infected population, which forms a hysteresis loop of type C, can be seen. However, for d < 1, due to the heterogeneity in two diseases, disease A is ready to produce stable infected population at α_{A}=1, while disease B is not. Hence, to have a sudden jump in the infected population, disease A has to produce more stable infected population so that the infected population for disease B can be stabilized due to their cooperation. Once both diseases can produce stabilized infected population, a discontinuous jump in the total infected population can then be observed. As the imbalance of the transmission rates between two diseases grows, i.e., d becomes smaller, disease A needs to produce even a greater number of infected population in order to generate stable infected population for disease B. Specifically, if 1≥d>d_{4}, then the discontinuous jump occurs at α_{d,o}=α_{d}, see, e.g., Γ_{d1},Γ_{d2},Γ_{d3} in Fig. 7(a). For d_{8}<d<d_{4}, meaning that the infection rate for disease B is further weaken, the discontinuous jump has to further wait until the nontrivial epidemic states can also be stabilized. Similar empirical interpretations can then be given for d > 1. In fact, if we switch the labels of diseases A and B in Eq. (10), then the corresponding ratios of α_{B}/α_{A} and β_{B}/β_{A} become 1/d. That is to say, system (10) with d > 1 and 0<d<1 is mathematically equivalent.
One final remark about the heterogeneity in two diseases is that the hysteresis loop of C shaped completely disappears whenever d≠1. Such an observation is based on the conjecture (i) mentioned earlier and in Figs. 7(a) and 7(b).
In this paper, we propose a fully cooperative coinfection model, which is investigated through the well-mixed approach. We prove analytically that the model exhibits three types of hysteresis, provided that the model is relatively nonuniform in its parameters. In particular, we prove that discontinuous outbreak transitions from the disease free or low prevalence state to the high prevalence state can be separately observed as a disease transmission rate crosses a threshold α_{o} from the below when the epidemic is still in the early stages and that discontinuous eradications from the high prevalence state to the low prevalence or disease free state are also separately seen as the transition rate reaches a threshold to α_{e}(<α_{o}) from the above when the outbreak occurs. Such phenomena are sharply in contrast to a single disease model which only exhibits a continuous transition. Moreover, the results also highlight the importance of preventing the outbreak of disease since it would then take greater effort to eradicate it.
The effect of heterogeneity in two diseases observed in Sec. III is based on simulations. It is, therefore, valuable to analytically verify the results mentioned there. It is of great interest to study the effect of vaccination and awareness on such a fully cooperative coinfection model. The network based approach for coinfection models with or without delay is also worthwhile to pursue.

APPENDIX: PROOFS OF SOME CLAIMS IN SEC. II
In the Appendix, we provide the rigorous proofs for some claims in Sec. II. We begin with proving some properties of fixed points of (1).
Proposition A.1. Let E^{*}=(S^{*},IA*,IB*,IAB*) be a fixed point of (1). Then, if E^{*} is a nontrivial endemic fixed point, i.e., (IA*)(IB*)(IAB*)≠0, then IA*=IB*. Otherwise, E^{*}=(1,0,0,0),(1α,1−1α,0,0) or (1α,0,1−1α,0).
Proof. To prove this proposition, we first show some basic properties of solutions of (1). Let E(t)=(S(t),I_{A}(t),I_{B}(t),I_{AB}(t)) be an arbitrary solution of (1). Then, either one of the following cases occurs: (A) S(t)≥1α for any t≥0 or (B) there exists t_{0}≥0 such that S(t_{0})<1α. If case (A) holds, we compute that
for any t≥0. Applying Barbalet's Lemma, we see that lim_{t→∞}Ṡ(t)=0, and hence, lim_{t→∞}I_{AB}(t)=0. If, on the other hand, case (B) occurs, then S(t)≤1α for any t≥t_{0}. Indeed, in contrast, there exists t_{1}≥t_{0} such that S(t_{1})≥1α and S′(t_{1})>0, a contraction to (A1). Then, defining a Lyapunov function V(t)=12(IA(t)−IB(t)){2}, we have that
for any t≥t_{0}. Similarly, applying Barbalet's Lemma, we get that lim_{t→∞}I_{AB}(t)=0 or lim_{t→∞}(I_{A}(t)−I_{B}(t))=0.
We are now in a position to prove the assertion of this proposition. Let E(t) be the solution of (1) with its initial state being the fixed point E^{*}=(S^{*},IA*,IB*,IAB*). Then, clearly, E(t)≡E^{*} for all t≥0. Moreover, if S^{*}≥1α, then S(t)≡S^{*}≥1α, and hence, IAB*=lim_{t→∞}I_{AB}(t)=0, as claimed in case (A). On the other hand, if S^{*}<1α, then S(t)≡S^{*}<1α, and hence, IAB*=0 or IA*=IB*, as claimed in case (B). In summary, if E^{*} is a nontrivial endemic fixed point, then IA*=IB*; otherwise, IAB*=0, and it can then be proved easily, via (1), that at least one of the conditions IA*=0 and IB*=0 holds, which completes the proof of the proposition.□
We next show that the solutions (S,α) of f(S,α)=0 with 0<S<1 implicitly define a function α¯(s) from (0,1/S] such that f(S,α¯(S))=0.
Proposition A.2. Fix a,b≥1 and c > 0. Then, for any 0<S≤1, there exists a unique α¯(=α¯(S)) on (0,1/S] such that f(S,α¯(S))=0.
Proof. Fix a,b≥1 and c > 0. We first consider the case 0<S<1. Writing f(S,α) as g_{S}(α), we have that g_{S}(0)=−1 and g_{S}(1/S)=a^{2}c(1−S)/S>0 for 0<S<1. Hence, there must exist α¯ on (0,1/S) such that g_{S}(α¯)=0. Suppose that there exist two roots α_{1} and α_{2} of g_{S}(α) on (0,1/S). Then, since g_{S}(0)=−1<0 and gS′(0)=−2(a−1)S≤0, there exists a critical point on [0,α_{1}). Moreover, another critical point should exist on (α_{1},α_{2}). Noting g_{S}(1/S)>0 for 0<S<1, we also conclude that a third critical point exists on (α_{2},1/S), a contradiction to the fact that g_{S}(α) is a cubic polynomial. Suppose there exist three roots on (0,1/S). Upon using the fact that g_{S}(0)<0, we conclude that g_{S}(α) must be increasing on (−∞,0), a contradiction to the fact that gS′(0)≤0. Therefore, g_{S}(α) has a unique root on (0,1/S) for 0<S<1. For S = 1, the assertion of the proposition can be verified directly.□
We next show that the graphs of α¯(S) and α̃(T) defined in (5) have the same shape on the interval of (0,1] in the following sense. Note that the transformation given in (4) defines a bijective mapping between (S,α¯(S)) and (T,α̃(T)).
Proposition A.3. For any 0<t<1, we have that
Here, function sgn(x) takes the sign of x.
Proof. By the chain rule, we have that for any 0<t<1
To complete the proof, it suffices to show that ddT[Tα̃(T)]>0 for all 0<T<1. Indeed, some direct computation yield that
where
We have just completed the proof of the proposition.□
To see the shape of the graph of α̃(T), we first compute the derivatives of α̃(T) at its two end points, 0 and 1.
Proposition A.4. The following assertions hold:
(i) lim_{T→0^{+}}α̃(T)=∞ and α̃(1)=1.
(ii) lim_{T→0^{+}}α̃{′}(T)=−∞ and α̃′(1)=1−2ac. In particular, if c=2a, then α̃′(1)=0.
(iii) lim_{T→0^{+}}α̃{″}(T)=∞ and α̃″(1)=−4a^{2}c[b−a−1/2]. Consequently, if b≤b_{c}, then α̃″(T)>0 on (0, 1).
(iv) α̃^{‴}(T)<0 for all 0<T≤1 and a≥1.
Proof. Some direct computations yield that
where
Then, the assertions of parts (i)–(iii) in the proposition can be verified directly. To see (iv), we rewrite M_{3}(T,a,b) as the polynomial form of b. Specifically, we have that
where U_{3}=−(1−T){4}(<0),U_{2}=−2aT[(a−2)T^{3}+6T^{2}−6T+2],U_{1}=a^{2}T^{2}[(4a−5)T^{2}+12T−6], and U_{0}=−2a^{3}T^{3}[(a−1)T+2](<0). Hence, to conclude the assertion (iv) in the proposition, we only need to show that U12−4U_{0}U_{2}<0 for all 0<T≤1 and a≥1. Indeed, we compute that U12−4U_{0}U_{2}=a^{4}T^{4}[(8a−7)(1−T){4}−12(1−T){3}−6(1−T){2}−4(1−T)+(1−8a)]≤a^{4}T^{4}[(8a−7)+(1−8a)]=−6a^{4}T^{4}<0. The proof is now complete.□
Proposition A.5. For any a≥1 and b≤b_{c}(:=a+1/2), the following two assertions hold:
(i) If c≤c_{2}, then α̃(T) strictly decreases on (0,1].
(ii) If c>c_{2}, then α̃(T) has a unique minimum on (0, 1). In particular, the graph of α̃(T) is C shaped.
Here, c_{2}=2a is defined as in (6).
Proof. Since b≤b_{c}, we have that α̃″(1)≥0 by Proposition A.4(iii). Consequently, α̃″(T)>0 for all 0<T<1 by Proposition A.4(iv), which implies that α̃(T) is concave up on (0,1]. In addition, α̃(T) strictly decreases on (0,1] if α̃′(1)≤0, while first decreasing and then increasing on (0,1] if α̃′(1)>0. The above cases correspond to c≤c_{2} or c>c_{2}, respectively, by Proposition A.4(ii). Hence, the proof is complete.□
For a≥1 and b>b_{c}, the graph of α̃(T) is more complicated since the concavity of α̃(T) changes from the upward to the downward on (0, 1) by Proposition A.4(iii) and (iv). More precisely, α̃(T) has an inflection point γ on (0, 1) such that
To classify its shape, we first find c so that the corresponding α̃(T) has some particular properties.
Proposition A.6. For any a≥1 and b>b_{c}(:=a+1/2), define γ as in (A4). Then, the following three assertions hold:
(i) There exists a unique positive c_{1}, defined as in (7), such that
In particular, c_{1} is chosen as the property stated in Theorem 2.1(II) is satisfied.
(ii) There exists a unique positive c_{12}, defined as in (8), such that the equation
In particular, if c_{12} possesses the property as stated in Theorem 2.1(II), then (A6) has a unique solution on (0, 1) when c=c_{12}. Moreover, (A6) has no solution on (0, 1) when c<c_{12}.
(iii) It holds that c_{1}<c_{12}<c_{2}. Here, c_{2}=2a is defined as in (6).
Proof. Fix a≥1 and b>b_{c}(:=a+1/2). We first show Proposition A.6(i). Since γ is the inflection point of α̃, it holds that α̃″(γ)=0. We have, via (A3), that M_{2}(γ,a,b)=0. Moreover, since function M_{2} is independent of c, we have that γ is also independent of c. On the other hand, note that
by (A3), and M_{1}(T,a,b,c) can be rewritten as
Clearly, α_{1}(T) and α_{0}(T) are positive for all 0<T<1. By choosing c_{1}=α_{0}(γ)α_{1}(γ), we have that
In fact, we can obtain the explicit form of c_{1}, as given in (7) by using the Maple.
We next show Proposition A.6(ii). By solving α̃(T)=1 directly, we have that T = 1 or
where
Hence, for equation α̃(T)=1 to have exactly one solution on ℝ, we must have L(a,b,c)=0 or, equivalently
We are then able to derive the following results.
(a) For c=c_{−}, we have that T̂=(abc_{−}−2a+1)2a(b−a)c_{−}<0 by some tedious computation. It implies that α̃(T) is either greater or less than 1 on the entire interval (0, 1). In fact, α̃(T)>1 on (0, 1) since limT→0^{+}α̃(T)=∞ by Proposition A.4(i).
(b) For c<c_{−}, we have, via direct computation, that
whenever 0<T<1. This implies that [α̃(T)]{c}>[α̃(T)]{c=c−}>1 for c<c_{−}.
(c) For c∈(c_{−},c_{+}), since L(a,b,c)<0, equation α̃(T)=1 has no solution on ℝ and hence [α̃(T)]{c}>1 on (0, 1).
(d) For c=c_{+}, we have that T̂=(abc_{+}−2a+1)2a(b−a)c_{+}∈(0,1) by some tedious computation. Moreover, since [α̃(T)]{c}>1 on (0, 1) for c<c_{+} as claimed above, we have that [α̃(T)]{c+}≥1 on (0, 1) and the equality holds if and only if T=T̂.
Hence, the proof of Proposition A.6(ii) is complete by choosing c_{12}=c_{+}.
Finally, we show Proposition A.6(iii). As in the proof of part (ii), we have that α̃(T)>1 on (0, 1) whenever c<c_{12}; while α̃(T)≥1 on (0, 1), there exists T_{*} on (0, 1) such that α̃(T_{*})=1 whenever c=c_{12}; α̃(T)<1 for some point on (0, 1) whenever c>c_{12} by (A6) and (A9). Then, by (A4) and (A5), we have that, when c = c_{1}, α̃(T) strictly decreases on (0, 1), and hence, α̃(T)>α̃(1)(=1) on (0, 1). So c_{1}<c_{12}. On the other hand, since α̃′(1)=0 by Proposition A.4(ii) and α̃″(1)<0 by (A4), we have that α̃′(T)<0, and hence, α̃(T)<α̃(1)(=1) whenever T is sufficiently close to 1^{−}. So, c_{2}>c_{12}.
We have just completed the proof of Proposition A.6. □
Proposition A.7. For any a≥1 and b>b_{c}(:=a+1/2), the following four assertions hold:
(i) If c<c_{1}, then α̃(T) strictly decreases.
(ii) If c∈(c_{1},c_{12}), then α̃(T) has a unique local minimum and a unique local maximum on (0, 1). The graph of such α̃(T) is to be called an S shaped. Moreover, we have that α̃(T)>1 for all 0<T<1.
(iii) If c∈(c_{12},c_{2}), then the graph of α̃(T) is also S shaped with α̃(T)<1 for some T on (0, 1).
(iv) If c>c_{2}, then α̃(T) has a unique critical point. The graph of such α̃(T) is to be termed a C shaped.
Proof. We first prove Proposition A.7(i). By (A4) and (A5), we have that, when c = c_{1}, α̃′(T)≤0 on (0, 1). Then, by (A7), we have that α̃′(T)<0 on (0, 1) if c<c_{1}. So, the assertion of part (i) holds.
We next prove Proposition A.7(ii) and (iii). For c∈(c_{1},c_{2}), we have that α̃′(γ)>0 by (A8) and α̃′(1)<0 by Proposition A.4(ii). Then, by (A4), we conclude that α̃(T) has a unique local minimum and a unique local maximum on (0, 1). The remaining parts of the proof have been claimed in the proof of Proposition A.6(iii). So, the assertions of parts (ii) and (iii) hold.
Finally, we prove Proposition A.7(iv). In fact, the assertion holds by (A4) since α̃′(γ)>0 by (A8) and α̃′(1)>0 by Proposition A.4(ii).
We have just completed the proof of Proposition A.7.□
The proof of the stability of fixed points of Eq. (1) is provided in the following:
Proof of Theorem 2.2. The proof of Theorem 2.2(i) is trivial, and hence, we omit it here.
We next consider the stability of E^{*}=(1α,1−1α,0,0) (Similar arguments below can be applied to E^{*}=(1α,0,1−1α,0)). Note first that since the total population is conserved, system (1) can be reduced to a system of three unknowns, say S(t), I_{A}(t),andI_{B}(t). A direct computation yields that the linearized matrix at E^{*} is of the form
where
Moreover, the characteristic polynomial of H is equal to
where
Since
Ĥ and hence H are Hurwitz matrices, which completes the proof of Theorem 2.2(ii).
Finally, we consider the stability of nontrivial endemic fixed point E^{*}=(S^{*},IA*,IB*,IAB*). We first compute that, via (2a) and by the fact that IA*=IB* (Proposition A.1), the linearized matrix at E^{*} is given as follows:
where
Moreover, the characteristic polynomial of M is equal to
where
by (2b), and M̂=[M̂ij]{1≤i,j≤2} with
Hence, E^{*} is locally stable, provided that the trace tr(M̂) and the determinant det(M̂) of M̂ are negative and positive, respectively. Moreover, E^{*} is unstable, provided that det(M̂)>0. In view of the form of α̃′(T), given as in (A2) and (A3), our next step toward completing the proof is to write tr (M̂) and det(M̂) in terms of T^{*}(=:αS^{*}), a, b, and c only. After lengthy and tedious calculations, we have, via (4), (5), and (2b), that
where m_{1}=acT^{*}(aT^{*}+b(1−T^{*}))>0. Hence,
and so, tr(M̂)<0. Furthermore, m12det(M̂)=det(M¯), where M¯=[M¯ij]{1≤i,j≤2}. Using a row operation on M¯ and some laborious calculations, we conclude that det(M̂)=2(T^{*}−1)α′(T^{*}), which implies that det(M̂) and α′(T^{*}) have opposite signs. The assertion of Theorem (iii) now follows from the fact that the monotonicity of α̃(T) is opposite to that of S̃. We have just completed the proof of Theorem 2.2(iii). The proof of Theorem 2.2 is now complete.□
TABLE I. 
Basic reaction scheme for the disease spreading in the well-mixed model (1) containing five parameters α, β, a, b, and c. The quantities a and b are the relative coinfection factors for the susceptible class and singly infected class, respectively. The quantity c is the relative infection factor. When a=b=c=1, the model is said to be uniform and corresponds to the noninteracting disease spreading model. The larger the deviation of these quantities from 1, the more nonuniform the model.

FIG. 1. 
Three types of hysteresis loops. The horizontal axis represents the homogeneous transmission rate α for a susceptible individual getting either one of the diseases. The vertical axis indicates the fraction of infected population. The horizontal level corresponds to no infected population. Our model has two stable fixed points whenever α_{e}≤α≤α_{o}. Consequently, for α_{e}≤α≤α_{o}, it would yield two stable epidemic state curves, indicating the infected population as represented by the red solid curves above. In the early stages of epidemics (resp., When the outbreak of the diseases occurs), as α gradually increases (resp., decreases) to α_{o} (resp., α_{e}), the infected population has a discontinuous jump (resp., drop) as indicated by the black dotted lines. By choosing suitable parameters of our model, there exist three types of hysteresis loops as demonstrated above.
FIG. 2. 
Graphs of α̃(T) with a = 1, b = 1.25 or 2, and various c > 0. The α coordinates of local minimum and maximum of α̃(T) are α_{e} and α_{o}, respectively. We color all the local minima (resp., maxima) by black (resp., red). (a) The numerically produced graphs of α̃(T) are consistent with the assertions in Theorem 2.1(I). Here, the parameters are set to be (a,b)=(1,1.25) and c varies discretely from 1.5<1.75<c_{2}(1)(=2)<2.25<2.5, which correspond to the five curves in the panel from the right to the left, respectively. At c = c_{2}, α̃(T) is tangent to α = 1 at T = 1. (b) The numerically produced graphs of α̃(T) are consistent with the assertions in Theorem 2.1(II). Here, the parameters are set to be (a,b)=(1,2) and c varies discretely from 1.75<c_{1}(1,2)(≈1.821)<1.85<c_{12}(1,2)(≈1.866)<1.92<c_{2}(1)(=2)<2.03, which correspond to the seven curves in the panel from the right to the left, respectively. At c = c_{1}, the tangent to α̃(T) at the unique inflection point γ is horizontal, while at c=c_{12}, α̃(T) is tangent to α = 1 at some T_{*} on (0, 1). Here, α̃(T^{*})=α_{e}.
FIG. 3. 
Graphs of endemic state curve S̃ on the (α,1−S) plane. The parameter set chosen to generate the curves displayed in (a) and (b) is the same as chosen from Figs. 2(a) and 2(b), respectively. The solid (resp., dotted) part of curves indicates the stability (resp., instability) of endemic states or the disease free state. The two intersection points of dotted and solid lines are outbreak transmission rate α_{o}, colored by red, and eradication transition rate α_{e}, colored by black, with α_{e}<α_{o}. (a) Parameters a, b, and c are chosen as those in Fig. 2(a), in which the relative coinfection factor b(=1.25) does not deviate from a(=1) by too much, i.e., b≤b_{c}=1.5. The shape of corresponding curves S̃ changes from increasing to C shaped as the relative infection factor c increases. (b) Parameters a, b, and c are chosen as those in Fig. 2(b). Here, b>b_{c}=1.5. The shape of corresponding curves S̃ undergoes more complicated transition as c gradually increases. As seen in the panel, S̃ changes from increasing to S_{r} shaped to S_{l} shaped to C shaped.
FIG. 4. 
Classification of endemic state curve S̃ on the (a, c) and (b, c) planes with the remaining parameter being fixed. In both panels, the graph of the corresponding S̃ either strictly increases or C shaped as b≤b_{c}(=a+1/2). Otherwise, its graph could be either of the four shapes: strictly increasing, S_{r} shaped, S_{l} shaped, and C shaped. (a) Set a = 1. Then, b_{c}=1.5. The corresponding curves c_{1}(1,b),c_{12}(1,b), and c_{2}(1) colored by purple, green, and orange, respectively, divide the (b, c) plane into 4 parts: strictly increasing, C shaped, S_{l} shaped, and S_{r} shaped. The parameters chosen in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b) correspond to the red (resp., blue) dots in Fig. 3(a). (b) Set b = 3. Then, for a < 2.5 (resp., a≥2.5), we have that b(=3)>b_{c} (resp., b(=3)≤b_{c}). The (a, c) plane is divided into 4 (resp., 2) parts whenever a < 2.5 (resp., a≥2.5).
FIG. 5. 
Classification of S̃ on the (a, c) plane with b = 25.5 and c < 1, which corresponds to the coinfection model of a mixed type. The graphs of c_{1}(a,25.5),c_{12}(a,25.5),andc_{2}(a) are colored by orange, green, and purple, respectively. For c=0.082=:c_{*}, as α gradually increases from 1 to 25, the shape of S̃ changes from strictly increasing to S_{r} shaped to strictly increasing to S_{r} shaped to S_{l} shaped to C shaped. The zoom in version of the curves near (a,c)=(25,c_{*}) is displayed on the middle right of the panel.
FIG. 6. 
Graphs of S̃ on the (α,1−S) plane with fixed b=25.5(=:b_{*}),c=0.082(=:c_{*}) and varying a > 0 discretely from 1.5<a_{1}<7<a_{2}<20<a_{3}<24.1<a_{4}<24.33<a_{5}<24.5. Here, a_{1}≈2.1643,a_{2}≈16.4997, and a_{3}≈24.0397 are the three positive roots of c_{1}(a,b_{*})=c_{*} (Fig. 5) and a_{4}≈24.2080 and a_{5}≈24.3902 are the roots of c_{12}(a_{4},b_{*})=c_{*} and c_{2}(a_{5})=c_{*}, respectively. The eleven curves in the panel from the right to the left correspond to various a values as given above, respectively. The zoom in version of the curves near α = 1 is displayed on the lower right part of the panel. As α increases from 1 to 25 discretely, the shape of S̃ matches perfectly as mentioned in Fig. 5.
FIG. 7. 
Let (a,b,c)=(1,2,2.03). Graphs of the fixed point curve corresponding to a heterogeneous model with the assumption that α_{B}/α_{A}=β_{B}/β_{A}≡d. Each curve consists of two stable branches, connected by a (dotted) unstable branch. For d = d_{5} and d_{−3}, we run the numerical simulation of the corresponding heterogeneous model with two initial states (I_{A}(0),I_{B}(0),I_{AB}(0))=(0.005,0.005,0),(0.4,0.4,0.1). The resulting eventual states, stopped at t=10^{4}, are denoted by the circle and crosses, which match quite well with our predicted branches. (a) Let 0<d≤1. The ten curves from left to right are the fixed point curve of the corresponding heterogeneous model d varying from 1 to d_{9}=0.58. As d gradually decreases to zero from one, Γ_{d} changes from C shaped to S_{l} shaped to S_{r} shaped to increasing. d_{4}, d_{6}, and d_{8} correspond to the values of d when such changes occur. The trivial epidemic curve ℓ_{1}:1−S=1−1α_{A} corresponding to the trivial epidemic equilibrium (S,I_{A},I_{B},I_{AB})=(1α_{A},1−1α_{A},0,0) is independent of d. The threshold α_{d,o} for discontinuous outbreak transition increases as d decreases from one. (b) Let d > 1 and d_{−k}=1d_{k}. For d > 1, the trivial epidemic curves ℓ_{d},1−S=1−1dα_{A}, corresponding to the trivial epidemic equilibrium (S,I_{A},I_{B},I_{AB})=(1dα_{A},0,1−1dα_{A},0), depend on d. The six fixed point curves (from left to right) correspond to various d values as indicated in Fig. 7(b). The threshold α_{d,o} for discontinuous outbreak transition α_{d,o} decreases as d increases from one. For 1<d<d_{−4}, Γ_{d} is a C-shaped. For d_{−4}<d<d_{−8}, Γ_{d} is a S-shaped. For d>d_{−8}, the corresponding fixed point curve increases.
