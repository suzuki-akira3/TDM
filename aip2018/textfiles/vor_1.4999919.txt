Numerical simulation and analysis of electromagnetic-wave absorption of a plasma slab created by a direct-current discharge with gridded anode
In this paper, we present investigation of a direct-current discharge with a gridded anode from the point of view of using it as a means of creating plasma coating that could efficiently absorb incident electromagnetic (EM) waves. A single discharge cell consists of two parallel plates, one of which (anode) is gridded. Electrons emitted from the cathode surface are accelerated in the short interelectrode gap and are injected into the post-anode space, where they lose acquired energy on ionization and create plasma. Numerical simulations were used to investigate the discharge structure and obtain spatial distributions of plasma density in the post-anode space. The numerical model of the discharge was based on a simple hybrid approach which takes into account non-local ionization by fast electrons streaming from the cathode sheath. Specially formulated transparency boundary conditions allowed performing simulations in 1D. Simulations were carried out in air at pressures of 10 Torr and higher. Analysis of the discharge structure and discharge formation is presented. It is shown that using cathode materials with lower secondary emission coefficients can allow increasing the thickness of plasma slabs for the same discharge current, which can potentially enhance EM wave absorption. Spatial distributions of electron density obtained during simulations were used to calculate attenuation of an incident EM wave propagating perpendicularly to the plasma slab boundary. It is shown that plasma created by means of a DC discharge with a gridded anode can efficiently absorb EM waves in the low frequency range (6–40 GHz). Increasing gas pressure results in a broader range of wave frequencies (up to 500 GHz) where a considerable attenuation is observed.
I. INTRODUCTION
Propagation of electromagnetic (EM) waves through plasma has attracted increased attention in recent years, mostly due to investigation of the “reentry blackout” phenomenon [1–9] and development of plasma stealth (or low observability) technology [10–16]. These two problems are opposite in a sense that in the first case the goal is to achieve perfect signal transmission through a plasma layer created on the surface of spacecraft entering earth's atmosphere, whereas in the second case the goal is to create such plasma that would fully absorb the radar signal. Recently for the latter purposes, it was proposed to use a multilayer structure consisting of dielectric glass, a plasma slab, and a radar-absorbing material (RAM) [12]. While investigating EM wave propagation in such a structure the authors assumed the plasma slab to be uniform and that it could be described by the values of electron density n_{e} and collision frequency ν_{ea} used as independent external parameters. Such treatment of plasma slabs is common in theoretical and numerical investigations of EM wave propagation through plasma (see Refs [3–6] and  [13–15]). However, creating plasma that would allow for separate control of electron density and collision frequency is a difficult task even in laboratory conditions, not to mention actual applications. Therefore, it is clear that further progress in the development of stealth technology is impossible without suggesting actual means of creating plasma and considering their absorbing properties.
This notion was pointed out in Ref [16], where a more viable strategy of investigating EM wave propagation through plasma was suggested. The authors conducted experimental and numerical investigation of EM wave propagation through inductively coupled plasma (ICP) in a cylindrical chamber. Using self-consistent simulations, they obtained spatial distributions of plasma parameters which allowed calculating EM wave propagation coefficients and comparing them with those obtained experimentally. Comparison showed good agreement, both in terms of plasma properties and EM wave propagation coefficients. In general, the strategy of combining discharge simulations with calculation of EM wave propagation allows making more reliable conclusions on the reflective and absorptive properties of plasma and should be employed when considering actual plasma stealth technologies.
It has long been known that in order for plasma to act as an efficient EM wave absorber it has to have a spatial gradient of electron density close to the wavelength of incident waves and high frequency of electron-atom collision [17–19]. Therefore, one of the promising methods for creating plasma in air for stealth purposes are electron beams with high energies (tens to hundreds of keV). In this regard, it is interesting to note Ref [20] where authors investigated the propagation of an electron beam through atmospheric pressure air. The authors showed that at such pressure a plasma slab with a thickness of about 1.5 cm can be created by an electron beam with an energy of about 15 keV. Therefore, it is expected that creating plasma with a few centimeters in thickness at higher altitudes (and pressures lower than atmospheric) by means of an electron beam is an achievable goal.
Electron beams can be efficiently generated by means of a direct-current (DC) discharge with a gridded anode [21]. Such discharges are ignited between parallel-plate electrodes, one of which (anode) is gridded (see Fig. 1). The distance between the electrodes d and applied constant voltage U_{0} are chosen so as to provide a cathode fall that would accelerate electrons up to high energies and inject them into the post-anode space. There they would lose their energy on ionization of background gas. This way plasma is created outside of the interelectrode gap as well. Part of the ions created this way will eventually bombard the cathode surface and cause emission of secondary electrons, thus sustaining the discharge. It has been shown that electron beam generation efficiency by means of such discharge can reach 95% in a wide range of gas pressures and in different gases and gas mixtures [22,23]. The configuration similar to the one depicted in Fig. 1 could serve as a segment of a larger coating that can be easily mounted on an aircraft and provide plasma cover that can be turned on and off.
In this paper, we present results of investigation of a DC discharge with a gridded anode from the point of view of using it as an EM wave absorber. Our goal was to make preliminary evaluations of absorptive properties of plasma created by means of such discharge and estimate prospects of using it as a means of creating absorptive plasma coatings. We have performed numerical simulations of plasma created in air by means of such discharge. The numerical model was based on a simple hybrid approach [24–26] which takes into account non-locality of ionization by beam electrons and therefore can provide reliable spatial profiles of plasma density, which is important for calculation of EM wave attenuation. Influence of the secondary emission coefficient on plasma properties was investigated with regard to achieving a higher range of fast electrons and therefore increasing the thickness of the plasma slab. Spatial distributions of electron density were obtained for different gas pressures and were then used for calculation of EM wave attenuation.
II. MODEL DESCRIPTION
The applicability of different numerical approaches for simulation of discharges in which non-local ionization plays a crucial role has been discussed intensively during the past decade [27–30]. It was generally agreed that such plasma objects as low-pressure hollow cathode discharges and negative glow part of direct-current glow discharges require account of non-local ionization by fast electrons streaming from the cathode sheath. The extended fluid approach that is widely used for simulations of different gas discharges and gas-discharge-based devices in these cases can give quantitatively and sometimes even qualitatively erroneous results [28,29]. DC discharge with the gridded anode is an even brighter example of a discharge that requires proper treatment of non-local ionization and whose properties cannot be even approximately described by the fluid approach alone.
In this work, simulations of a DC discharge with a gridded anode are carried out using a simple hybrid approach [24–26]. The approach is based on distinguishing two groups of electrons: the “fast” group which constitutes of electrons with energies higher than the energetic threshold of inelastic collisions, and the “slow” group which constitutes of the electrons with energies lower than the threshold and is described by local values of electron density n_{e}(x). The first group is responsible for non-local ionization, while the second group constitutes of most of the plasma electrons whose energy distribution is described by the Maxwellian electron energy distribution function (EEDF).
Densities of slow electrons and heavy particles are obtained from continuity equations written in the drift-diffusion approximation for charged particle fluxes
Here, j indicates j_{th} species (subscripts e, i, m, O_{2}, and N_{2} are used for slow electrons, positive ions, negative ions, and neutral oxygen and nitrogen molecules, respectively), Γ_{j} is the jth particle flux, μ_{j} and D_{j} are the mobility and the diffusion coefficient of the jth particle, q_{j} is the electric charge of the corresponding particle type, and S_{j} is the jth particle source function defined as
Here, n_{j} and n_{r} are densities of reacting particles and k_{j,r} is the reaction rate constant. The set of plasmachemical reactions used in the model and the corresponding rate constants are presented in Table I. Simulations were carried out in air as a mixture of molecular oxygen O_{2} (26%) and nitrogen N_{2} (74%). Active plasma species included electrons, positive ions O_{2}^{+}, negative ions O_{2}^{–}, neutrals O_{2}, and N_{2}. Besides direct ionization by fast electrons, it included electron attachment and detachment, ion-ion and electron-ion recombination, and ionization by slow electrons. The set was developed in Ref [33] and was later used for simulation of DC glow discharges in air in Refs [34] and  [35]. Transport properties of ions were taken based on experimental data [31], the mobility of slow electrons μ_{e} was calculated based on solution of the Boltzmann equation, and the diffusion coefficient D_{e} was obtained from Einstein relation D_{e}/μ_{e}=eT_{e} [36].
Density of fast electrons is negligible in comparison with density n_{e} of slow electrons, and they only contribute to the ionization source in continuity equation (1) [24–26]. The source is formulated analytically as [24–26]
Here, Γ_{e}(0) is electron flux at the cathode surface, α is the Townsend ionization coefficient, and d_{c} is the cathode sheath length [31]. The decay constant λ in (4) was evaluated based on experimental data in electron range R_{e} in air [32], so that the source function decreased significantly on distance equal to R_{e}.
The continuity equations were coupled with the Poisson equation for electrostatic potential
Here, ε_{0} is dielectric permittivity of vacuum.
The discharge configuration allows creating a large-surface plasma coating, which means that transverse dimensions of plasma would necessary be greater than its longitudinal dimensions (see Fig. 1). This means that the problem with a reasonable degree of accuracy can be considered in a 1D formulation. The model geometry is presented in Fig. 2. It consisted of two domains corresponding to the interelectrode gap (domain I, 0≤x<d) and the post-anode space (domain II, d≤x≤L+d). In each of the domains, the described system of equations was solved separately. The domains were coupled at the anode by a special transparency boundary condition which ensured that charged particle fluxes could cross the anode grid. The condition was formulated as follows.
Let us consider total particle flux Γ_{I} moving in the interelectrode gap towards one side of anode grid with transparency coefficient μ=1−θ. At the anode, part of the flux proportional to θ will be lost on the solid part of the anode grid surface, while the rest (1−θ)Γ_{I} will move towards the grid hole. From the other side of the anode, a similar flux (1−θ)Γ_{II} will move towards the hole as well, and the two fluxes will compensate each other. The resulting flux on the anode surface in the gap ΓI′ and in the post-anode space ΓII′ will then be
A non-local ionization source in the post-anode domain was defined as
The grid transparency θ was chosen to be 0.85. The secondary emission condition was set on the cathode boundary of the interelectrode domain I, while the insulation condition was set on the boundary of the post-anode domain II to imitate open space. The anode was grounded in both domains which ensured continuity of electric potential in the whole simulation domain. The discharge chamber was connected to an external circuit. Varying ballast resistance allowed controlling discharge current. Cathode potential was calculated from the circuit equation.
The described above system of equations was solved using a finite-element method in COMSOL Multiphysics software [37]. Spatial distributions of electron density obtained during simulations were then used to obtain attenuation of an incident EM wave.
The incident wave was assumed to be a plane wave travelling at a normal angle to plasma created by DC glow discharge (in Fig. 2 this corresponds to the right-to-left direction). Plasma was considered as a sequence of N thin plasma slabs. In each of the slabs, electron density was assumed to be uniform. Based on continuity of electric field in the interface between two consequent slabs, it is possible to define coefficients of refraction, transmission, and absorption that can be found from complex dielectric permittivity of plasma ε [38]. The latter is defined by frequency of incident wave w, plasma frequency w_{p}, and electron collision frequency ν_{ea} [38,39]
Combining together coefficients obtained for each plasma slab allowed calculating total fractions of power attenuated and absorbed by plasma created by the discharge. For simplicity, the anode grid was assumed to be a prefect reflecting surface. The number of slabs N in our simulations was equal to 5000. The value was obtained experimentally to ensure independence of calculation results from the number of slabs. For detailed description of the method, see Refs [40] and  [41].
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
First, let us consider discharge structure and properties of plasma typically obtained during simulations of DC discharge with a gridded anode. Figure 3 presents spatial distribution of main discharge parameters for the case of air at pressure p =10 Torr, discharge voltage U_{0} = 1 kV, secondary emission coefficient γ = 0.01, interelectrode gap d =1 mm, and length of post-anode space L =1 cm. Figure 3(a) shows distributions of charged particle densities (electrons and positive and negative ions) and Fig. 3(b) shows rates of main plasmachemical processes—non-local ionization, electron attachment, and electron-ion recombination. The dashed vertical line in these figures corresponds to position of the anode grid.
In general, the discharge mechanism can be described as follows. Electrons emitted from the surface of the cathode due to ion bombardment are accelerated up to high energies and cause multiple ionization and excitation events on their way. Since for considered conditions, the electron range R_{e} is greater than the length of the interelectrode gap [at U_{0} = 1 kV and p =10 Torr R_{e} is 5 mm (Ref [32])], electrons enter the post-anode space and create plasma there. Part of ions created before the position of maximum plasma density will drift towards the cathode and cause secondary emission, thus sustaining the discharge.
As it can be seen from Fig. 3(b), volume recombination processes are significant, and charge particles are lost within the discharge volume rather than on wall boundaries. This leads to local balance of ionization and recombination rates, which, in turn, leads to the spatial profile of electron density that is similar to the spatial profile of the non-local ionization rate. This is the reason why the maximum of electron density is observed within the interelectrode gap (where ionization rate is maximum), and then it decays exponentially while moving into the post-anode space [see Fig. 3(a)].
The exponential decay of plasma density with distance from the anode grid ensures that at the gas-plasma interface electron density will be small. Most part of the incident EM wave will enter plasma, where it will be absorbed due to electron-molecule collisions. For simplicity, the anode was considered as a perfectly reflecting surface. However, as it can be seen in Fig. 3(a), electron density in the vicinity of the anode grid in the post-anode space is very high, and the EM wave will be reflected before reaching the anode grid. But since electron density decays exponentially, the point of total reflection will still be close to the grid. Hence, in order to increase EM wave attenuation, a greater thickness of the plasma slab is desirable [12].
The thickness of plasma created by means of DC discharge with a gridded anode is defined by the range of fast electrons R_{e}, which for a given pressure p is defined by discharge voltage U_{0}. However, increasing U_{0} to increase the thickness of plasma cannot be done infinitely, since it will eventually lead to high discharge currents that will cause significant heating and transition to arc discharge, which can result in serious damage to the electrodes [30]. This can be mitigated by using cathode materials which have a low secondary emission coefficient.
Figure 4 shows current-voltage characteristics (CVC) of the discharge obtained during simulations by varying the value of ballast resistance R for cases of different secondary electron emission coefficients γ = 3 × 10^{−3}, 1 × 10^{−3}, and 3 × 10^{−4} which approximately correspond to the nickel cathode in air [31]. Discharge parameters in this set of simulations were: pressure p =10 Torr, interelectrode gap d =0.7 mm, and length of post-anode space L =6 cm. As expected, using a lower secondary emission coefficient results in higher discharge voltage. Figure 5 shows comparison of electron density profiles in the post-anode space obtained for the same current density j_{c} = 0.48 A/cm^{2} for these γ. Discharge voltages were 2.29, 3.04, and 3.96 kV, correspondingly. As it can be seen, electron densities are higher and decay more slowly in the case of the lowest γ, since the range of fast electrons increases with discharge voltage.
In order to investigate EM wave attenuation by plasma created by DC discharge with the gridded anode, we obtained spatial distributions of electron densities in the post-anode space of the discharge for different pressures p =10, 25, and 50 Torr, the profiles are presented in Fig. 6. The simulations were carried out with γ = 3 × 10^{−4}, d =0.7 mm, and L =6 cm. Discharge voltages U_{0} for different pressures were 4, 6.7, and 10.2 kV correspondingly. Electron collision frequencies ν_{en} were calculated using
Here, N_{a} is neutral gas density, ξ_{e} is electron energy, σ_{ea} is total electron collision frequency, and T_{e} is electron temperature. The obtained values for considered cases were 7.9 × 10^{10}, 2.0 × 10^{11}, and 4.0 × 10^{11} s^{−1}.
Figure 7 shows obtained attenuation of EM wave as a two-way attenuated reflection for conditions from Fig. 6. As it can be seen, a generally good attenuation is observed in all cases in a wide range of wave frequencies. The maximum of attenuation corresponds to resonant absorption in the vicinity of collision frequencies for considered pressures. Within the low frequency range (6–40 GHz), the increase in pressure leads to decrease in attenuation, although still a considerable attenuation (>40 dB) is observed in all cases. In each case for wave frequencies higher than electron collision frequency, a reduction in attenuation is observed. The reduction is sharper for the case of lower pressure, where already at 200 GHz almost no attenuation takes place, whereas for the case of p =50 Torr attenuation is about 60 dB in this frequency region and still increases up to 400 GHz.
Figure 8 shows spatial distribution of ratio of imaginary ε″ and real ε′ components of dielectric permittivity for case p=10 Torr for different wave frequencies, which provides qualitative estimation of EM wave propagation through the slab [38]. As it can be seen, upon entering the plasma slab the wave propagates through without significant absorption, ε″ε′≪1 for all considered frequencies. Further into the slab, waves with lower frequency are greatly attenuated, with most attenuation taking place closer to the anode grid. Waves with higher frequency experience little-to-none attenuation. Such picture corresponds well with attenuated reflection presented in Fig. 7.
IV. CONCLUSION
In this paper, prospects of using plasma created by DC discharge with a gridded anode as an EM wave absorber were investigated. Discharge was simulated using a simple hybrid approach with a special transparency boundary condition, which allowed considering the problem in 1D. It was shown that the model allows obtaining spatial distributions of main discharge parameters such as plasma density and uses it for calculation of EM wave attenuation. Such an approach is more reliable when estimating EM wave transmission through the plasma slab than using arbitrary values of electron density and collision frequency. It should be noted that the assumption of exponential decay of the non-local ionization rate used in the model is based on experimental measurements of light emission [42] and hybrid simulations of DC glow discharges in noble gases at lower pressure (a few Torr) [43], when volume recombination is not significant. However, fast electrons should not experience significant recombination, since its rate is inversely proportional to electron energy, which means that assuming exponential decay of the ionization rate should not lead to significant errors in plasma density. Moreover, the setup studied here provides a good way to obtain more data on the spatial distribution of non-local ionization rate in air by carrying out probe measurements of plasma density at conditions when recombination is significant.
Preliminary estimation of EM wave attenuation of a plasma slab created by means of DC discharge showed good attenuation in a wide range of wave frequencies. The increase of gas pressure led to a wider range of wave frequencies where good (>40 dB) attenuation was observed. The obtained preliminary results allow concluding that the investigated discharge can be a good basis for development of actual plasma stealth technology, and further investigation, mainly experimental, is required.
