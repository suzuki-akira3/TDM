Study on the role of recondensation flux in high power laser welding by computational fluid dynamics simulations
Partial penetration welding with fiber laser on 20 mm thick plates was carried out in horizontal position to study the role of secondary heating in modeling of high power fiber laser welding. Experiments were carried out using 18.8 kW laser with 1.5 m/min welding speed at Ar assist gas flow rates of 0, 17, 29, and 40 l/min, all four cases show similar bead shape with bright emission of vapor plume. Numerical simulations were performed using volume of fluid method by considering three different models as models A–C. Model A considers only Fresnel reflection inside the keyhole using real time tracking of free surface. Model B considers vapor recondensation flux inside keyhole along with model A. Finally, model C is used, which considers vapor plume heating at 4100 K temperature along with models A B. Secondary heating by recondensation and vapor plume is vital in modeling of high power fiber laser welding; especially, the upper part of the bead is more influenced due to secondary heating. Tungsten particles are also used to visualize the flow pattern of melt pool.
I. INTRODUCTION
Vapor plume in fiber laser welding behaves quite differently from CO_{2} lasers. In case of CO_{2} lasers, the plasma plume interrupts the incoming laser due to high degree of ionization, while in fiber laser, the plasma is weakly ionized [1] and not act as a barrier to stop the incident laser. Main source of heating in laser welding is Fresnel absorption, but a vapor-plume can act as a secondary heat source and its effect may change the characteristics of the bead formation. Cho et_al [2] used a radiation heat source to model the vapor-plume heating for 6 kW disk laser, and they found that the vapor-plume heat source plays an important role in the bead shape formation at the upper part. Multiple reflections inside a keyhole is the most prominent mechanism to transfer the laser energy in the keyhole model of laser welding. Incident of high power laser would cause material to evaporate, which form plasma/vapor plume. The plasma-plume interacts with the incoming laser and causes a secondary heating of the work piece. In CO_{2} laser welding, the plasma plume temperature is found to be very high, such as 11 500 K, even for a small power of 2 kW [3]. This indicates that a high heating from plasma plume is expected in case of CO_{2} laser welding. In contrast to CO_{2} lasers, the new generation of high brightness lasers (fibers/disk) shows different characteristics resulting in a lower plume temperature such as 4500 K even for power of 20 kW [4].
Kawahito et_al [1] performed fiber laser welding on SS-304 in Ar environment and found that the temperature of the laser induced vapor plume is approximately 6000 K. Lee and Mazumder [5] studied the energy transfer characteristics of fiber and disk laser welding for spheroidal graphite cast iron and estimated that the temperature of plasma plume is around 6480 and 6350 K for disk and fiber laser, respectively. Uspenskiy et_al [6] studied the welding plume for low alloyed steel with a fiber laser up to 20 kW. They divided the laser plume into two parts: the lower part, up to 5 mm height form the surface, and the upper part, from 5 to approximately 50 mm height. Their study suggest the plume temperature in the range of 3200 to 4500 K for lower part at welding power range of 3 to 20 kW, without the use of shielding gas. In the presence of Ar shielding gas, the temperature in the lower plume drop down to 2500 K, while for the upper part, the temperature remains constant at around 2500 K (it is to be noted that the boiling point for iron is 2900 K). They attributed such low temperatures in the observed vapor plume to a comparatively high degree of condensation, which was in agreement with their experiments on laser beam scattering on condensed particles constituting the vapor plume.
Wang et_al [7] studied periodic oscillations of the plasma induced during laser welding for ZL114 aluminum alloy using 4 kW fiber laser. They also divided the plasma into two regions, similar to Shcheglov et_al [4], naming them a keyhole plasma near to keyhole and a floating plasma that stays above weld pool. Unlike [4] their observations shows that the keyhole plasma, near to keyhole is always present either the shielding gas is applied or not while the floating plasma can be blown away by gas flow. They also concluded that the floating plasma is linked with the keyhole plasma and periodic changes of the floating plasma are synchronized closely with that of the keyhole plasma. Foster et_al [8] studied the vapor plume for SS-304 L and reported a vapor temperature of 5600 K without assist gas and increase in temperature to 8000 K when Ar assist gas was used. Li and coworkers [9] investigated the heating efficiency of the vapor plume by experimental means. In their experiments, they placed a plate in the way of the vapor plume, which remained undamaged in course of the experiment. The observations were limited because the vapor plume was cooled down by air before it condensed on the surface of the plate, it was not under continuous laser irradiation to keep it heated and finally the plate used was not preheated by molten pool, while in real welding, the molten pool preheats the surface. Their experiments also revealed that in fiber laser welding most of the energy is transferred in first few reflections.
Some interesting phenomenon is observed when the fiber laser welding is carried out under vacuum. Katayama et_al [10] showed that welding under vacuum increase the penetration depth as well as it changes the shape of the bead for welding of stainless steel and aluminum. Luo et_al [11,12] and Chen et_al [13] also studied the fiber laser welding under vacuum for low alloyed steels and reported an increase in the penetration depth and a suppression of the vapor plume in a high vacuum. In all studies related to vacuum welding, a change in the bead shape is found for all cases.
Ai et_al [14] did a remarkable work in the development of numerical simulation model for fiber laser that also considers the gas layer above the molten pool so that weld reinforcement can be incorporated in the appeared bead shape. Ai et_al [15] further applied their model to predict the bead shape of the weld at lower power levels of 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 kW. Most of the studies cited above are experimental studies and cannot give sufficient in depth information to analyze the mechanism taking place in the formation of the bead shape. Tenner et_al [16] showed different types of bead shapes that are observed in high brightness laser welding. In some of their experimental results, a shift of the bead shape from narrow at the bottom to slightly wide at the top is observed. In this study, an attempt was undertaken to show systematically the role of different secondary heat sources that may change the shape of the bead in high brightness laser welding. Physical and numerical evidences are presented to show the need of adding secondary heat source models to better simulate the process of high power fiber laser welding. The case of high laser power of 18.8 kW was considered in order to further improve the process of high power, high brightness laser welding simulations.
II. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE AND MATHEMATICAL MODELS
A. Experimental procedure
In order to perform a weld for inclined plates, a large diameter pipe section with a thickness of 20 mm was used so that the fixture could be clamped to the plate easily. The arrangement for the experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1. Laser welds were made autogenously on low carbon steel plate with a thickness of 20 mm at four different assist gas flow rates. The characteristic parameters of the fiber laser used are listed in Table I. The continuous power fiber laser available at BAM was used at 18.8 kW power and a welding speed of 1.5 m/min. In one particular case, no assist gas is used, while for other three experimental runs, Argon assist gas was used to shield the molten metal at a flow rate of 17, 29, and 40 l/min, and the assist gas was traveling ahead of laser is all cases. A high speed camera was used to capture the top surface of the molten pool.
In order to see the cross-sectional weld bead, the welds were sectioned at three different locations, and the examples of sections are shown in Fig. 2.
This study was focused on the modeling for atmospheric pressure welding; therefore, the laser plume interaction happening in atmospheric pressure welding was studied in more detail to get a better model. In welding under normal atmospheric condition, the side assist gas is the main source to reduce the effect of atmospheric conditions, and it might affect the vapor plume and the bead shape. Therefore, experiments were made with side assist argon gas using flow rates of 0, 17, 29, and 40 l/min.
In Fig. 3, it was shown that for all cases of flow rates the bright emission of vapor plume was present. The difference was minor in a way that there are some occasions where the bright emission was not visible for higher flow rates of 29 and 40 l/min. In all the four cases, the bead shape was also showing similarity as seen in Fig. 4. Detailed analysis of bead shape also showed that a very minor difference was observed with regard to the penetration depth, bead width at the top, and at the middle was shown in Fig. 5. The important observation in all experiments was that for all four assist gas flow rates the vapor plume was present at the top and also the bead was wider at the top and narrow at the bottom which means that the assist gas was unable to eliminate the vapor plume above the keyhole in welding under atmospheric pressure. Therefore, the vapor-plume heating was an important consideration for modeling of high power fiber laser welding.
B. Governing equations
1. Assumptions
Welding involves a complex multiphysical phenomenon which includes fluid flow and heat transfer in solid, liquid, and vapor phases, with conduction, convection, and radiation mechanisms taking part simultaneously. Thus, researchers have attempted to simplify the process of considering these physical phenomena by making various assumptions. In the present simulation, the following assumptions and simplifications have been considered.
1. Molten metal is assumed to be an incompressible laminar fluid with Newtonian viscosity.
2. The volume-of-fluid method is used for calculating the free surface shape of the keyhole, together with a ray-tracing algorithm to estimate the multiple reflections inside the keyhole.
3. The laser beam profile is assumed to be Gaussian before entering the keyhole.
4. When the laser beam enters the keyhole, multiple reflections of the laser beam are considered based on the Fresnel absorption model, using Hagen–Rubens' simplification.
5. In the mushy zone, the Carman–Kozeny equation is used.
6. The region of gas or plasma is treated as a void because solid or liquid steel has a greater density level than gas or plasma.
7. The gas bubble inside the molten zone is treated as adiabatic.
2. Governing equations
Generally, three-dimensional transient simulations are carried out for laser welding. Here, the mass conservation equation, the momentum conservation equation, referred to here as the Navier–Stokes equation, the energy conservation equation, and the volume of fluid (VOF) equation were used as governing equations to execute the molten metal flow analysis.
a. Mass conservation equation

Here, V is the velocity vector.
b. Navier–Stokes equation
where K=C[Fs2/(1−Fs){3}+B^{*}].
Here, ρ is the fluid density, P is the pressure, v is the dynamic viscosity, K is the drag coefficient for a porous media model in the mushy zone, G is the body acceleration due to body force, C is a constant representing mushy zone morphology, F_{s} is the solid fraction, and B^{*} is the positive zero used to avoid division by zero. The third term of the right-hand side of Eq. (2.2) is the source term for the frictional dissipation in the mushy zone. Here, the Carman–Kozeny equation derived from the Darcy model is used to model the flow in the mushy zone based on the assumption that this region can be treated as a porous media [17].
c. Energy conservation equation
Here, h is the enthalpy, k is the thermal conductivity, and T is the temperature. The enthalpy-based continuum model was used as shown in the following equation, to consider the solid–liquid phase transition:
Here, h is the enthalpy, ρ_{s} and ρ_{l} are solid and liquid density, C_{s} and C_{l} are specific heat at constant volume of the solid and liquid phases, T_{s} and T_{l} are solidus and liquidus temperature, and L_{f} is the latent heat of fusion.
d. VOF equation
Here, F is a volume-of-fluid.
3. Laser welding process models
Commercially available flow software by Flow Science Inc. [18], was used to analyze the heat transfer and fluid flow while tracking the free surface in the process of welding, while standard equations of mass conservation, momentum conservation (Navier–Stokes), energy conservation, and the VOF were solved numerically. The molten metal was assumed to be an incompressible laminar flow with Newtonian viscosity. Various welding models are used along with standard governing equations for heat transfer and fluid flow analysis to simulate molten pool behaviour during keyhole mode laser welding. The effect of different weld positions was obtained by varying the magnitude and direction of the gravity force for different positions. A detailed introduction of the laser beam profile, submodel of multiple reflections in the keyhole, submodel of Fresnel absorption, submodel of recoil pressure, etc., can be found in the previously published paper by Cho et_al [2] Salient features of these models are discussed briefly.
The laser is modeled by dividing it into 777 distinct energy bundles. It means that total energy of laser ray is divided into 777 subenergy rays, called energy bundles; each energy ray is assigned a unique value of energy so that it completely represents the Gaussian distribution defined by Eq. (2.5). These energy bundles are assigned at focal position. Along the direction of laser travel toward the work piece surface, the position of energy bundles changes in accordance with the diverging profile of laser. Each energy bundle retains its energy value unless it falls on any cell of work piece. When each energy bundle falls on any cell of work piece, it transfers its energy to that cell and reflected toward the new direction with reduced energy. The initial energy of the 777 energy bundles is defined on the focal plane with an energy distribution function, by the following equation, as a Gaussian function, as mentioned in Ref [19]
where r_{f0}=2λFM^{2}/π,P_{L} is the laser power, λ is the wavelength, F is the focusing number, and M^{2} is the beam quality factor. The initial path of these energy bundles is defined by considering the diffraction of the laser ray path. The laser ray path is a function of “z” as in the following equation:
where z_{o} is z at the focal plane while z_{r} is the Rayleigh length. The above ray tracing and energy distribution continues until the ray is reflected by the free surface of the keyhole. The free surface selection is done by checking the 26 neighboring cells of the cell of interest in the computational domain. If any of the 26 neighboring cells is found to be a void cell with the void connected to the outer surface, then this cell is selected as a free surface cell.
The defined energy bundles follow the predefined path unless they interact with the work piece, and the laser forms a keyhole inside the work piece after interaction with the work piece. In laser welding, the formation of the keyhole is a key issue and the interaction of the laser with the keyhole determines the effectiveness of the laser welding model. In this model, multiple reflections of the laser are considered inside the keyhole.
The ray r→, after being incident on the free surface cell having center a_{1}, gives away some part of its energy to the cell, according to the Fresnel reflection model, and some part of the energy is reflected toward another free surface cell which has its center point at a_{2}. The reflected ray r_{1}→ can be defined by following the simple vector equation r_{1}→=r→−2(r→⋅N_{1})N_{1}, where N_{1} defines the surface normal of cells, which reflects the laser ray. The process of reflection and energy absorption is continued until the laser loses most of its energy or the laser ray goes out of the keyhole. The process is repeated for all the 777 energy bundles.
Calculation of reflectivity plays an important role in energy transfer inside the keyhole. In our simulations, reflectivity R_{cs} was calculated based on the simplification made by the Hagen–Rubens relationship. The Hagen–Rubens relation is valid for metals which are good conductors and when the wavelength of the laser beam is sufficiently long (infrared). In Eq. (2.7), the reflectivity R_{cs} is a function of the incident angle of the beam with respect to surface normal, ∅, and a laser-material dependant quantity, ε (Ref [20])
where
Here, ε_{1} and ε_{2} denote the real parts of the dielectric constants of the metal and plasma, respectively, σ_{dc} is the dc-conductivity of the material, ω is the angular frequency of laser, and ε_{0} denotes the permittivity of free space. The value of ε was found to be 0.25 for the fiber laser incident on steel. Some studies suggest using a compensated value to cope for penetration depth but in our study a noncompensated value of ε is used. The other parameters used are ε_{0} = 8.854 × 10^{−12} F m^{−1}, ε_{1} = 1.0, ε_{2} = 1.0, and σ_{dc} = 5.0 × 10^{5} Ω^{−1} m^{−1} [21].
When the keyhole is formed, the recoil pressure is the most important force for laser welding, by driving liquid flow in the molten pool. There are several recoil pressure models, and Eq. (2.9) is used in this paper, which is related to the wall temperature of the keyhole [22]
where L_{v} is the latent heat of vaporization, R¯ is the gas constant, and T_{b} is the boiling point.
Finally, the buoyancy force, which is a body force, can be modeled by the Boussinesq approximation and is expressed as follows:
Here, g is gravity, β is the thermal expansion rate, and T_{0} is the reference temperature. Gravity force is acting toward bottom as shown in Fig. 7.
When a metal is heated beyond its vaporization temperature, vaporized particles depart from the surface. These vaporized particles interact with the laser and thus become further heated. The spectroscopic measurement of a plume in 10 kW fiber laser welding confirms that the inverse Bremsstrahlung effect is negligible, where the plume is weakly ionized, and that almost all the elements in the plume consist of neutral atoms of iron. The temperature of the plume has been reported to be 6000 K (Ref [1]). Heating by vapor plume is considered at the upper part of the keyhole by using a radiation heat source of 6000 K. The same model for vapor heat source used by Cho et_al [2] for disk laser is used here for a fiber laser. The only difference is in the range of application for the vapor heat source. The range of application means the radius of circle, measured from the axis of laser, in which radiation heat source is transferring the heat to the specimen. In the previous model, the range was defined as 1.5 times the Rayleigh length, which corresponds to a value of 3.3 mm. In this study, instead of defining the application range as a function of Rayleigh length, the same geometric value of 3.3 mm is used. The shear stress induced by the vapor was not considered in this study.
In this study, three different simulation models were used, the most basic one, model A is shown in Fig. 6(a), considers only the Fresnel reflection inside the keyhole without any secondary heating. The heat transfer by multiple reflections inside the keyhole was the only source of the energy. Although it sounds simple, most of the energy is transferred in laser welding by Fresnel reflection mechanism. The details of the multiple reflection algorithm can be found in the previous studies of Cho et_al [2,23,24] and Sohail et_al [25] In this model, only 18% recondensation was considered.
C. Vapor recondensation model
It is a well-known fact that the recoil pressure induced force is the dominant force that forms the keyhole in high power laser welding. Vaporized metal particles are responsible for inducing this recoil force; therefore, the study of vaporization plays a vital role in the laser keyhole welding. Application of a high power laser forces metal to be evaporated; the particles of evaporated metal take away both mass and energy from the place of the laser irradiation. A small amount of the mass removal could lead to a considerable amount of the energy removal as this mass contain both the latent energy and the thermal energy up to the boiling point of the metal, which is very high.
Evaporation flux J_{v} can be calculated using modified Langmuir equation is shown as [26]
where β_{R} is the recondensation coefficient. P_{sat} is the saturation pressure of the vapor corresponding to the temperature T, M is the atomic mass, R is the universal gas constant, and T is the surface temperature.
The determination of an amount of recondensation taking place in laser material processing has been a challenging task for researchers for a long time. Early research by Anisimov [27] proposed that the amount of recondensation should be 18% of total vaporization. This study was carried out for evaporation in vacuum so this value can be considered as the lowest amount of an inevitable recondensation. The same value was used by Cho et_al [2] along with the use of the modified Langmuir equation to calculate the energy loss by vaporization.
However, in Table II, it can be seen that the vaporization energy loss was much lower in the experimental studies by Hirano et_al [28] and Kawahito et_al [29] than the amount of loss predicted by the simulation. This deviation becomes worse if the sensible heat was also taken into account and the laser power was increased in the simulation. This suggests that a bigger part of the energy of that, which was lost by vaporization, must return back to the melt pool. Hirano et_al [28] found experimentally that, based on the modified Langmuir equation with experimentally obtained temperature distribution, 90% of particles are condensed back to the melt pool. In all three models, recondensation coefficient, β_{R}, is taken as 0.18 which means 18% recondensation at the point of vaporization. In models B and C, additional recondensation flux of 72% is introduced. In summary, for model A, only 18% recondensation is taking place, while for models B and C, 90% recondensation is taking place.
Multiple reflections inside the keyhole were responsible for depositing different part of energy at each point where they irradiate. This lead to a local increase in the temperature above the vaporization temperature, thus vaporization is achieved. It was already demonstrated experimentally [9] and by simulations [25] that first few reflections deposit more energy in fiber laser welding. It was also proven experimentally that overlap ratio between keyhole inlet and laser spot was around 100% at low welding speed, which means that most of the laser energy falls inside of the keyhole in fiber laser welding [29]. Therefore, more amount of vaporization could be expected at the bottom part of the keyhole where more energy is deposited. This amount of the vapor propagates toward the exit of the keyhole and can be a subject for recondensation on the keyhole walls in the upper part. The depth of the keyhole was 15 mm in case of 18.8 kW laser welding. There are two ways to consider the recondensation effect of this vapor. The first one is by using the recondensation coefficient described in Eq. (2.11) and the second one is in the form of heat flux on the keyhole walls.
If the recondensation coefficient of 0.9 was used, applying the recondensation by this way would give more penetration with narrowing down the bead at the upper surface. Therefore, only 18% recondensation was considered in Eq. (2.11). The physical evidence of the bead shape and using the study of Li et_al [30] suggests that the temperature of the vapor plume was higher at upper part of the keyhole as compare to the lower part. Therefore, it was assumed that the vapor was recondensing toward the exit of the keyhole and the energy lost by vaporization was reapplied as a heat flux, linearly varying from the bottom of the keyhole toward the top. Figure 6(a) shows the application of 18% local recondensation, In model A, the local recondensation is occurring at the points where laser is striking the surface in multiple reflections, shown as dots in Fig. 6(a). Figure 6(b) shows the recondensation of 72% using linear recondensation heat flux, where the heat flux is applied on the cells of keyhole wall in such a way that applied heat flux is increasing linearly from bottom of keyhole toward the exit of keyhole.
In conclusion, the value of 90% recondensation was used in a way that 18% of recondensation was considered in modified Langmuir equation, while the remaining 72% of energy was redistributed as surface heat flux inside the keyhole. The surface heat flux was increased from the bottom of the keyhole toward the top of the keyhole in linear fashion. The linear increase was assumed as the vapor absorbs the energy from the laser on its way toward the keyhole exit, so its energy content would be increased. In this paper, the model A refers to the model where only local recondensation of 18% was considered, while the model B refers to 90% recondensation in which 18% recondensation was applied as same as in the model A with addition of 72% recondensation flux applied as linearly increasing recondensation heat flux.
D. Plume heating model
In laser welding, no complete energy of the incident laser beam is absorbed by the molten pool but some part of the energy leaves the keyhole after reflections as well as some part of the energy is consumed to heat up the vapor plume. It is to be noted that although 90% of metal vapor is condensed but still 10% of the vapor escapes out of the keyhole. A bright glow above the keyhole surface was observed in laser welding experiments, which indicates a high temperature plume which can also heat up the molten pool above the keyhole. In the model B, the vapor recondensation flux was applied only inside the keyhole, but the vapor/plasma plume outside the keyhole can also acts as a heat source which can change the bead shape in the upper part. Cho et_al [2] applied this vapor plume heating as a radiation heat source using the plume temperature of 6000 K. Compiling the reported plume temperature by recent studies in Table III, it was found that different studies have reported different temperatures. Therefore, it was concluded that these different temperatures were due to different base materials used or it can be attributed to different methods used for measurement. In this study, a low carbon steel was used for which the temperature reported by Shcheglov et_al [4] was used. In this study, the plume temperatures dependency on incident laser power has been observed. Thus, the temperature of 4100 K was used for the used value of the laser power of 18.8 kW. The model C, shown in Fig. 6(c), combines the previous models A and B.
E. Material properties and boundary conditions
Low carbon steel plate with a thickness of 20 mm was considered in this study. The physical properties of the material and coefficients used in the simulation are shown in Table IV. Figure 7 shows the coordinate system and computational domain used in the study. The analytic domain was set as 61 mm in length, 26 mm in width, and 34 mm in height, including void regions at both the top and bottom sides for free surface tracking.
The energy on both the top and bottom free surfaces is balanced between the laser heat flux, the heat dissipation by convection and radiation, and the heat loss due to surface evaporation. The energy balance is expressed as follows:
where n→ is the vector normal to the local free surface, h is the convective heat transfer coefficient, and T_{o} is the ambient temperature. This ambient temperature can be room temperature when considered away from the keyhole or metallic vapor plume temperature when the region is near the keyhole. ε_{r} is the surface radiation emissivity, σ is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant, and T is the surface temperature. The change in energy and mass by evaporation is calculated by considering the evaporated mass flux under the assumption that roughly 18% of all evaporating particles return to the surface [22]. The energy balance on the bottom free surface is expressed in a manner similar to Eq. (2.12) with the only difference being that the laser source is absent at the bottom surface because partial penetration is considered in our simulations.
For the pressure boundary condition, the following equation was used on the free surface:
where P_{R} is the recoil pressure on the keyhole wall, γ denotes the surface tension coefficient, and R_{c} denotes the radius of the surface curvature.
With the boundary conditions introduced above, the governing equations were solved using the computational fluid dynamics code FLOW3D. The Navier–Stokes equation was solved to compute the reference velocities using the initial conditions or previous time-level values using an explicit approximation. Pressures were then iteratively calculated with the generalized minimum residual (GMRES) method by implicit algorithm in each cell, and the velocity changes induced by pressure change were added to the reference velocities computed in the previous step. The energy conservation equation was solved by using the explicit method. The VOF equations were solved finally to determine the updated free surface [18]. Repetition of these steps will produce a solution through any desired time interval.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Results with only Fresnel reflection inside the keyhole
Figure 8(a) shows the bead shape obtained when only multiple reflections inside the keyhole were applied the heat source model. Corresponding experimental results for 18.8 kW fiber laser welding were also shown in Fig. 8(d). It can be seen clearly that the penetration depth predicted by simulation, with only Fresnel reflections, agrees well with the simulated results but the difference was coming in the upper part of the bead. The bead shape obtained through the numerical solution was narrow at the top and wider at the bottom, while the experimental results shows opposite trend, i.e., the bead was wider at the top and narrower at the bottom. Comparing the results of all three numerical models reveal that in model A, Fig. 8(a), more under cut is visible which reduces in model B, Fig. 8(b). The under-cut is completely removed in model C, Fig. 8(c), and some bead crowning is observed. The main reason for this undercut in models A and B is the formation of humps in melt pool which results in uneven distribution of solidified metal on top surface. A gradual and minor increase in penetration depth is also observed from models A–C.
The unique type of the bead in the simulation with Fresnel reflections only was also observed in some experimental results when welding under vacuum was performed. The bead shapes obtained from the study of Katayama et_al [10] at atmospheric pressure and under vacuum confirms that the bead shape obtained under vacuum, especially high vacuum show the similar trend obtained in simulation. The bead obtained under normal atmosphere was wider at the top and become narrower at the bottom, while in contrast, the bead obtained under vacuum become narrower at the top and wider at the bottom. The consideration of the mechanism taking place in vacuum can explain the directions how the model for laser welding simulation for fiber laser welding can be improved.
The vacuum environment changes the interaction of the laser with welded material in multiple ways. In vacuum beam, focus shift is negligible, whereas the laser beam focus position gets shifted randomly when the laser interacts with the vapor plume at atmospheric pressure. The beam focus shift effect was not considered in simulations which make it more similar to the case of welding in vacuum. Three dimension trace of incoming lasers and keyhole surface is shown in Fig. 9. One of the important features of current model is modeling of converging and diverging behavior of laser ray. These ray traces are defined for 777 rays as shown as blue color lines in Fig. 9, while green color dots represent the cells that are identified as the surface cells by search algorithm used in current model. The information of free surface cells and laser ray traced was extracted from the model and was plotted using plotting software. The laser shown is before reflection inside the keyhole. Figure 9 explains more detail about how the laser rays were reaching the bottom of the keyhole. The laser was focused on the top surface. It can be seen that most of the rays were reaching the bottom of the keyhole uninterrupted. In case of fiber laser welding, most of the rays were absorbed during first few reflections; therefore, more energy is transferred to the bottom of the keyhole which make the bead wider at the bottom. Luo et_al [11] also studied the fiber laser welding under vacuum and showed that under these conditions the vapor plume above the keyhole becomes suppressed. This reduction of the vapor plume would minimize or completely eliminate its heating effect.
B. Vapor recondensation inside the keyhole
It was shown in TABLE II that a considerable amount of the vaporization energy loss was observed in the simulation when only the Fresnel reflection inside the keyhole was taken into consideration using 18% recondensation at the point of laser irradiation. Despite the high vaporization loss of energy, the model with only Fresnel reflection showed good agreement in terms of penetration depth, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The 18% recondensation in Eq. (2.1) affects the energy balance mostly at the point of the laser irradiation. Higher amount of energy is absorbed at the bottom of the keyhole which will facilitate more vaporization at the bottom part of the keyhole. The vapor expands toward the keyhole exit. In case of partial penetration welding, there is only one exit at the top of the surface, and therefore the vapor expands upward to the exit. Passing to the exit, it absorbs more energy from the laser beam and in the same time releases the energy due to expansion and condensation at the keyhole walls. Experimental evidence of this phenomenon can be found from the study of Li et_al [30] which shows that the temperature of vapor plume inside the keyhole increases from the bottom toward the exit and high the vapor pressure and atomic density drop from the bottom toward the exit of keyhole. In order to incorporate this phenomenon into the simulation, the recondensation flux is applied in linearly increasing fashion form the bottom of the keyhole toward the exit as explained in Sec. III C. The resulting bead shape shows better agreement with the experiments in compare to the bead shape without considering recondensation flux as shown in Fig. 8(b). The main difference was observed in the upper part of the bead with a wider fusion zone in compare to the model without recondensation flux. Small increase in the penetration depth was also observed in the model with 90% recondensation flux because a net energy input was higher due to compensation of lost vaporization energy in the model without recondensation flux.
C. Plume heating with recondensation
It was already shown in Fig. 3 that the vapor plume heating cannot be neglected when welding is considered at atmospheric pressure. Therefore, both models considering the recondensation inside the keyhole (model B) and the vapor plume heating are shown in Fig. 6(c), contribute to the heat input as well as a radiation above the keyhole surface. Welding of 18.8 kW yields a vapor plume temperature of 4100 K. The vapor plume heating was mainly affecting the upper bead shape in a way that the metal on the top surface uniformly reinforce the bead [Fig. 8(c)]. In general, the bead shape was similar that in Fig. 8(b) but this model is more adequate in description of the observed physical phenomena.
D. Flow pattern comparison
The flow pattern shows that in case of the Fresnel reflection model (model A) and the model with only vapor recondensation heating (model B), humps were found at the upper surface of the bead as shown in Figs. 10(a) and 10(b). In case of the model with both vapor condensation and vapor plume heating, the bead was smooth on the top surface and no humps were formed as shown in Fig. 10(c). Overall, the flow in the bottom part of the keyhole was similar and a recirculation was found at the bottom of the melt pool. In both models A and B, the heat sources are inside the keyhole, only a small part of laser would strike molten pool outside the keyhole. Absence of heating above the surface of specimen would result in lesser heat content to the molten pool outside the keyhole; therefore, it would soon reduce its energy to solidify thus results in hump formation. In contrast, if plasma plume heating is considered in the model, the plume heating would provide some energy to the melt pool above the surface of specimen so it would remain in liquid state for a longer time thus smoothing of molten pool is observed.
In many researches, Tungsten particles are used in order to experimentally visualize the flow pattern inside a molten pool. This method gives the trajectories of particles inside the molten pool. In order to have a direct comparison with observed experimental flow patterns, particles similar to the Tungsten particles were introduced in the middle of the workpiece at locations shown in Fig. 11. The flow patterns of all particles can be seen in supplementary material video file attached for model C [31]. A comparison of particle behavior in different models for particles Nos. 23, 18, and 13, shown in Fig. 11, is presented in Fig. 12. The comparison is shown for same location particles for all three models A, B, and C.
The comparison shows that among different models, the model C corresponded to the case with the most intensive movement of the particles, the model A shows least intensive movement of the particles, while the model B reveals particles movement in between of the models A and the model B. In the model A, the particles 23 and 18 are trapped much quickly as compared to the particle 13 which occurs to be considerably more mobile as shown in Figs. 12(a), 12(d), and 12(e), respectively. This behavior is ought to the fact that more amount of heat is deposited in the bottom part of the keyhole as compared to the upper part of the keyhole. In the model B, the particle 23 was able to escape the keyhole and continue its motion on the top surface of the molten pool, particle 18 which was initially located approximately at the middle of the keyhole is trapped much easier, thus showing less movement while particle 13, which was at the bottom, travels a longer distance as compared to the other two particles in the same model. This means that the trend of high heat deposition at the bottom of the keyhole remains unaffected in the model B [Figs. 12(b), 12(e), and 12(h)]. Figures 12(c), 12(f), and 12(i) show that an intensive movement is characteristic for all three particles in the model C as compared to the other models, while the penetration depth was unaffected. The model C is closer to experimental results because the large amount of molten metal was present in the experimentally observed melt pool shown in Fig. 3. The particles at the bottom in all cases show prominent movement of particles [Figs. 12(g), 12(h), and 12(i)].
IV. CONCLUSIONS
Laser welding simulation for 18.8 kW fiber laser was carried out with three models; (a) Fresnel reflection model only (model A), (b) vapor recondensation flux inside the keyhole (model B), and (c) with vapor plume heating (model C). Modeling of vapor recondensation flux and vapor plume heating is important for modeling high power fiber laser welding. Fresnel reflection model was the basic heat source that was responsible for providing deep penetration due to vapor induced recoil pressure but the bead shape achieved is comparative narrow at the top. Only Fresnel reflection leads to a high vaporization loss as compared to experimental studies therefore a mechanism was proposed to redeposit this energy as recondensation flux inside the keyhole. It is assumed that the vapor transfer its energy during its propagation which widens the bead in the top part. Total of 90% recondensation was considered based on the experimental results available. The bead shape results from the three models mostly differ in upper part, model A gives penetration with narrower bead at the top, model B gives a slightly more penetration with little increase in bead width at the top, while model C is found to give more increase in bead width at the top with a negligible increase in penetration. Model with recondensation heat flux is better in simulating high power fiber laser welding. The vapor plume also shows bright emission on the top surface which heats up the upper surface by means of radiation. Considering this radiation along with recondensation flux inside the keyhole shows promising results for high power welding simulation. Particularly, smoothing of the melt pool was found. The introduction of tungsten particles inside the specimen has also helped in visualizing the flow pattern inside the keyhole which also supports the improved modeling in case of model C.
Although some improvement was made in secondary heat source modeling in high power fiber laser welding, consideration of focus shift under atmospheric pressure as well as a consideration of change of vaporization temperature due to high pressure inside the keyhole can be modeled for better agreement between simulations and an experiment.
