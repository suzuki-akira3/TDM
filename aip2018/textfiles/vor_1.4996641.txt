Analytical study of polymer deposition distribution for two-dimensional trench sidewall in low-k fluorocarbon plasma etching process
In this study, a new polymer deposition distribution model for a two-dimensional low-k porous SiOCH trench structure during the fluorocarbon plasma etching process is described so as to investigate the bowing effect in a nanoscale trench. The model consists of three processes, namely, (1) polymer reflection, (2) ion-assisted polymer deposition, and (3) ion-assisted polymer emission. To calculate the distribution of the polymer, the polymer flux arrived at the surface points of the trench was calculated based on the model. To estimate the profile of the trench, the flux of the etchants at the point of the trench surface was also considered. The simulated etching process is based on a simple flux model, which takes into account angular distributions for ions and radicals from the sheath edge to the trench. Simulation results show that the lower section of the sidewall had a larger number of polymer particles than the other positions of the sidewall did. According to the simulated results, the sidewall bowing amount was estimated to be about 2.9 nm and the bowing position was approximately 29.8 nm at a trench depth of about 148.5 nm. With the proposed polymer distribution model, the bowing effect during fluorocarbon plasma etching can be further understood for a nanoscale process.
I. INTRODUCTION
Integrated circuits used in semiconductor manufacturing are continuously scaling down to achieve low cost and high performance by following Moore's law. However, in doing so, the RC delay has increased and emerged as a major performance issue because the linewidth between metal interconnections also decreased during downscaling, thus affecting resistance and capacitance of the metal lines and adjacent metal lines [1–3]. To overcome the issue, changing interlayer dielectrics (ILDs) with a low dielectric constant (low-k) have been suggested to alleviate the increase in the RC delay [4,5]. In current device processes, porous SiOCH (p-SiOCH) is widely used in copper interconnection line processes [1,3,6,7]. However, because of the natural physical and chemical properties of the material, there are some defects like trench sidewall damage that occurs during plasma etching of the trench.
Generally, ions and radicals from the plasma sheath physically and chemically damage the p-SiOCH ILD during the etching and manifest as the sidewall defects. To avoid this, fluorocarbon (C_{x}F_{y})-based plasma etching has been widely adopted because C_{x}F_{y} polymers form a passivation layer on the surface of the trench during etching [8–10]. These polymer layers effectively protect the damage induced by ion and radical etchants. Nevertheless, this sidewall damage becomes a significant issue because even a small defect of the trench induces dramatic RC delays in nanoscale processes. Among the various types of trench sidewall damage, the bowing effect, which forms a barrel-shaped sidewall of the trench, is important. Many complicated process factors induce the bowing effect, which makes avoiding this effect challenging.
The primary mechanism of the bowing effect is the lateral etching of ions and radicals due to their imperfect anisotropic etching and partial isotropic etching, respectively [10]. However, polymers originated from both the plasma sheath and the ion etching contribute to the surface passivation of the trench during the process, resulting in suppression of lateral etching at the sidewall [9,10]. Therefore, sidewall passivation by a polymer layer is an important effect of the bowing effect in C_{x}F_{y}-based plasma etching, and consequently, estimating accurate polymer deposition distribution at the trench sidewall is an important issue in low-k plasma etching. The simulation of the etching profile has been mathematically studied by several groups. However, these studies are mainly focused on the etch process only. Dalvie et_al [11], Singh et_al [12], and Giapis and Hwang [13] did not consider the passivation of the polymer layer. Kokkoris et_al [14] only investigated ion-assisted polymer deposition. Ouyang et_al [15] studied the nonuniform passivation of polymers; however, they did not account for ion-assisted polymer emission. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the model for the distribution of the polymer layer numerically in low-k plasma etching processes.
In this paper, we developed a polymer deposition distribution model for the low-k p-SiOCH trench sidewall during the C_{x}F_{y} plasma etching process. In addition to ion-assisted polymer deposition, the proposed model is based on three mechanisms of the polymer behavior during the etching process, namely, polymer reflection, ion-assisted polymer deposition, and ion-assisted polymer emission. To successfully construct the model, etching and deposition mechanisms are numerically treated to simulate the profile evolution of the trench along the etching time. The results are compared with experimental data to confirm the validation of the proposed model.
II. DEVELOPMENT OF THE POLYMER DISTRIBUTION MODEL
Figure 1 shows a schematic of the modeled trench with several geometrical parameters. Defining the horizontal direction as the x-axis and the vertical direction as the y-axis, while considering the center as the left-bottom edge of the mask as shown in Fig. 1, an arbitrary surface point i can be described as (w_{i},d_{i}). Here, w is the width of the trench, w_{i} is the lateral position of the surface point i, d_{i} is the vertical position of the surface point i, and t_{m} is the thickness of a hard mask. θ_{1},θ_{2},θ_{3}, and θ_{4} are denoted as the angle between the x-axis and the line from the surface point, i, to each edge of the mask, to consider the shadowing effect at the surface point of the trench due to the trench depth and the thickness of the hard mask. These angles can be denoted as
The visual angle is defined as an angle where the flux can affect the surface point of the trench. Equations (2) and (3) represent the left visual angle, θ_{l}, and right visual angle, θ_{r}, respectively, for a surface point which has the lateral position smaller than w/2, as shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b),
In Eqs. (2) and (3), θ_{x}|_{n̂i} denotes an angle between n̂_{i}=n̂_{i,x},n̂_{i,y} and the x-axis, described as
Similarly, Eqs. (5) and (6) describe left visual angle θ_{l} and right visual angle θ_{r}, respectively, for the surface point which has a lateral position larger than w/2 (not graphically shown here), which can be written as
After determining the visual angles, the distribution of the incident ion and radical flux are required to calculate the total amount of each flux arrived at the surface point of the trench. Simple descriptions for angular distribution functions of ions and radicals are selected to verify the polymer deposition distribution model. For the ions, the angular distribution function is denoted as
where θ is the incident angle, n_{I} is the concentration of ion flux, v_{B} is the Bohm velocity, m_{I} is the mass of the ion, k_{B} is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and v_{I} is the velocity of the ion which is v_{I}=2eV_{sh}/m_{I}, where V_{sh} is the sheath voltage [16]. For the radicals, angular distribution can be calculated based on the Maxwell distribution which is shown below,
where n_{r} is the concentration of radical flux and m_{r} is the mass of the radical [11].
Figure 2(a) shows a schematic of the calculation of the total flux at the surface of the trench. Since the method is based on a mathematical approach, it can be applied to both ion and radical fluxes. For the ions, the total amount of ion flux at the surface point i is derived by combining Eqs. (1)–(7),
Similarly, the total amount of radical flux at the surface point i is derived by combining Eqs. (1)–(6) and (8),
Equations (9) and (10) imply that only the fluxes within the range of visual angles, θ_{l} and θ_{r}, can etch the surface. In other words, the angular distribution of the ion flux is very narrow so that the sidewall of the trench is barely bombarded by them, while radical flux relatively bombards the entire surface of the trench.
After determining that the arriving fluxes depend on surface characteristics of the trench, surface evolution by a simple etching model is performed. Since visual angles and the arriving fluxes of every specific surface point should be calculated, the string method is chosen,
In Eq. (11), Δw and Δd imply etch or deposition, which are dependent on the amount of etch rate and deposition rate. t is the simulation cycle that denotes the successive numerical calculation of the etching process. One cycle starts with the calculation of ion, radical, and polymer fluxes arriving at surface points and then ends after determining profile evolution by the calculated etch and deposition rate. As a result, profile evolution by the string method is progressed in sequence.
To find Δw and Δd, etch and deposition models are required. The etching model of the trench is simply treated, as shown in the following equation:
where n is “I” for the ion and “R” for the radical, k_{etch} is the etch probability on the surface, and ρ_{film} is the density of the deposited p-SiOCH film. On the other hand, for the polymer deposition distribution model, three major mechanisms are chosen for simplicity as shown in Fig. 2(b); (1) deposition of reflected polymers, (2) ion-assisted polymer deposition, and (3) ion-assisted polymer emission. Deposition of reflected polymers, called polymer reflection, denotes that wandered polymers with low energy into the trench repeatedly collide and are reflected at the surface of the trench [8]. During etching, there are numerous polymer collisions at the surface that consequently result in a uniform deposition distribution [8,12,14]. As a result, the deposition rate of the reflected polymer with low energy is almost identical for all surface points on the trench, which is simplified by
where k is the deposition probability of the polymer on the surface and Г_{poly} is the total amount of polymer flux at the surface.
However, ions can form polymer byproducts during the etching process, resulting in nonuniform distribution of the polymers. When the ions bombard the surface, part of the ions does not etch the surface due to their low energy, resulting in the creation of a polymer with high energy [8]. This is because ions which lose part of their energy turn into excited polymers. This process is called ion-assisted polymer deposition. The rest of the ions, which are transformed into polymers but cannot be stacked on the surface of the trench, are reflected to another surface point of the trench. This process is called ion-assisted polymer emission.
Assuming that these mechanisms are the dominant factors that determine the distribution of the polymer, the distribution of the polymers becomes nonuniform and the total amount of polymer flux at the surface point i can be described by the following equation [12]:
In Eq. (14), i and j denote the arbitrary surface points, ŝ is a unit normal vector of the surface i, and K_{I,dep},K_{I}, and K_{refl} are the reaction coefficients of the ion-assisted polymer deposition, ion-assisted polymer emission, and polymer reflection, respectively. Γ_{I,j} is the ion flux arrived at a surface point j, and Γ_{poly,0,j} is the incident polymer flux arrived at surface point j. P() is a probability function of the polymer movement from a surface point i to a surface point j, which is denoted by
assuming that the distribution of the flux emission is independent of the surface point [12]. In other words, reflection of the polymer is diffuse reflection which means that the reflected angle of the polymer does not directly dependent on the incident angle of that, like specular reflection. The function P() implies that the reflected amount of polymer decreases when the angle between ıȷ⇀ and ŝ is increased. From Eqs. (14) and (15), it can be observed that the polymer flux at a surface point can be described and the distribution of the polymer can be estimated.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A model for estimating the profile of the simulated trench surface is described below. The trench width and thickness of the mask are set to 80 and 26 nm, respectively. The number of initial surface points of the trench is set to 1000, which means that the first surface point lies on the bottom-edge of the left mask [(0,0) nm position] and the initial distance of each surface point is 0.8 Å. CF_{4}^{+} for the ion, F* for the radical, and CF_{4} for the polymer are selected as core chemical species because of complicated possible reactions in fluorocarbon-based plasma etching. Then, reaction coefficients K_{I,dep}, K_{I}, and 1−K_{refl} are set to 0.08, 0.011, and 0.0033 [8]. Figure 3 shows the visual angle of the left-sidewall along the depth from 10 to 60 simulation cycles where each “cycle” represents an independent process of simulated etching. Since the structure of the simulated trench shows a symmetric feature to the center of the trench, the right-sidewall is not shown in the figure. During the etching process, the surface points at the upper section of the sidewall are laterally etched, resulting in a steep decrease in θ_{r} and a negative increase in θ_{l}, as shown in Fig. 3(a). Also, the surface points which are close to the mask have a high lateral etch rate because of relatively high θ_{r} with respect to θ_{l} shown in Fig. 3(b). These results imply that the sidewall of the trench undergoes isotropic etching.
Figure 4 shows the amount of ion flux at the left-half of the trench along the depth. Figures 4(a) and 4(b) clearly show that anisotropic etching by fluorocarbon ions is performed during the etching process. However, sidewall damage is also observed due to the angular distribution of the incident ions, considering that the incident ion and radical flux arriving at the surface directly is proportional to the etch rate of a-SiOCH. In Fig. 4(a), the vertical surface position with maximum ion flux is 16.8 nm from the surface before etching for ten simulation cycles and 101.2 nm from the surface before etching for 60 simulation cycles. This indicates that the lower section of the sidewall is damaged less upon ion bombardment as the simulation cycle is increased.
Similar to Fig. 4, the amount of radical flux at the left-half of the trench along the depth is also calculated as shown in Fig. 5. Both the lateral and vertical directions show a steep change in the amount of flux near the bottom of the trench, which implies the presence of a border between the sidewall and the bottom of the trench. In Fig. 5(a), the surface points located at the upper section of the sidewall have maximum lateral radical flux regardless of simulation cycles. As the simulation progresses, however, the overall amount of vertical radical flux is decreased because of the narrower visual angle. These results indicate that the upper section of the sidewall undergoes a high lateral radical etch rate, resulting in severe sidewall damage.
Figure 6 shows the amount of polymer flux at the left-half of the trench along the depth, with various simulation cycles. According to the simulated results, polymer flux at the upper section of the sidewall decreases when the simulation cycle is increased. Since most polymers arrive at the lower section of the sidewall, there is a high amount of deposition. In detail, polymer deposition strongly occurred at 22.1 nm of the trench depth (85.2% position of the trench depth) after ten simulation cycles, while it occurs at 140.51 nm of the trench depth (94.6% position of the trench depth) when the simulation cycle is 60. This result implies that the position of the maximum deposition point moves toward the bottom of the trench as etching progresses. Also, it shows that most of the byproducts arrive at the lower section of the sidewall. Therefore, a bowing profile occurs at the upper section of the sidewall due to the lack of protection to the polymer layer there.
Figure 7 shows the simulated trench profile with the developed model and a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the experimental trench profile. For comparison, the target depth of the simulated trench is set to the measured depth of the experimental trench (simulated depth of 148.5 nm versus experimental depth of 147.6 nm). For etching the trench, a CF_{4}-based capacitively coupled plasma reactive ion etching with O_{2}/N_{2}/Ar gas is used under the following process conditions; a high-frequency plasma of 40 MHz/200 W, a low-frequency plasma of 13 MHz/50 W, a pressure of 40 mTorr, a CF_{4} gas flow of 40 sccm, and a process time of 70 s. As shown in Fig. 7(a), the amount and the position of sidewall bowing are estimated at about 2.9 and 29.8 nm from the surface, respectively. In addition to the model investigation, 2.95 nm of the bowing and 30.4 nm of the bowing position are acquired from experimental results, as shown in Fig. 7(b). This is a good agreement between the simulated and experimental profiles. Also, the results indicate that the proposed polymer model is appropriate to explain the bowing effect of the sidewall of the nanoscale trench.
IV. CONCLUSION
A novel polymer deposition distribution model for a two-dimensional low-k p-SiOCH trench structure during fluorocarbon plasma etching is developed for investigating the bowing effect in nanoscale trenches. The proposed model shows that nonuniform distribution of the polymer is achieved, where the model is based on three polymer deposition mechanisms: (1) polymer reflection, (2) ion-assisted polymer deposition, and (3) ion-assisted polymer emission. To verify the polymer distribution model, the evolution of the trench profile was determined by a simple etching model taking into account the angular distribution of the ion flux and radical flux. The result indicates that sidewall damaging by lateral etching mostly occurs at the upper section of the sidewall during the etching process, resulting in the bowed profile of the trench. Also, the simulated trench targeted to a depth of ∼150 nm shows a bowing amount of 2.9 nm and a bowing position of 29.8 nm with a trench width of 80 nm. The simulated profile of the trench shows good agreement with the experimental etching profile of the trench which shows a bowing amount of 2.95 nm and a bowing position of 30.4 nm with a trench width of 80.3 nm. Thus, the bowing effect of the trench during C_{x}F_{y}-based plasma etching can be numerically estimated by the proposed polymer deposition distribution model for a nanoscale process.
