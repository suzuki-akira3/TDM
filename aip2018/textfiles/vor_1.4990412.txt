Electrical characteristics and density of states of thin-film transistors based on sol-gel derived ZnO channel layers with different annealing temperatures
We report on the fabrication and electrical characterization of bottom gate thin-film transistors (TFTs) based on a sol-gel derived ZnO channel layer. The effect of annealing of ZnO active channel layers on the electrical characteristics of the ZnO TFTs was systematically investigated. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra indicate that the crystal quality of the ZnO improves with increasing annealing temperature. Both the device turn-on voltage (V_{on}) and threshold voltage (V_{T}) shift to a positive voltage with increasing annealing temperature. As the annealing temperature is increased, both the subthreshold slope and the interfacial defect density (D_{it}) decrease. The field effect mobility (μ_{FET}) increases with annealing temperature, peaking at 800 °C and decreases upon further temperature increase. An improvement in transfer and output characteristics was observed with increasing annealing temperature. However, when the annealing temperature reaches 900 °C, the TFTs demonstrate a large degradation in both transfer and output characteristics, which is possibly produced by non-continuous coverage of the film. By using the temperature-dependent field effect measurements, the localized sub-gap density of states (DOSs) for ZnO TFTs with different annealing temperatures were determined. The DOSs for the subthreshold regime decrease with increasing annealing temperature from 600 °C to 800 °C and no substantial change was observed with further temperature increase to 900 °C.
INTRODUCTION
Zinc oxide (ZnO) is a wide band gap metal oxide semiconductor which provides many advantages such as non-toxicity, environmental stability, and transparency. It has an energy band gap of approximately 3.37 eV and a large free-exciton binding energy of approximately 60 meV at room temperature [1], which makes it a viable candidate for electronics [2,3] and optoelectronics [4–6]. In addition, the material is considered as radiation hard and can be used for space-based electronics where numerous types of radiation are prevalent [7].
Both direct-current (DC) [8,9] and radio-frequency (RF) [10,11] magnetron sputtering have been commonly used to deposit ZnO at low temperatures. However, these deposition techniques require an expensive instrumentation and the throughput is limited. Compared to sputtering, the sol-gel deposition technique offers several key advantages. It is a relatively low cost technique, simple to set up, and can allow a high throughput [12]. Therefore, in this investigation, the ZnO channel layers were grown via the sol-gel technique, followed by transistor device fabrication.
Since the annealing of the ZnO channel layer is a critical part of the ZnO TFT fabrication step, it is of great importance to determine the optimal annealing temperature. The effect of annealing on both the optical properties of the ZnO active layer and the electrical characteristics of TFTs is worthy of investigation. One of the methods to characterize the transistor characteristics is to determine the sub-gap density of states (DOSs), from which a valuable insight into various intrinsic electrical properties such as the field effect mobility, the threshold voltage, and the subthreshold swing, etc. can be gleaned. Many methods exist for studying sub-gap DOS distribution; photoluminescence (PL) [13,14], photo-excited trap-charge-collection spectroscopy (PECCS) [15], capacitance-voltage (CV) measurement [16], and temperature-dependent field effect measurement [17–20]. The CV measurement, PECCS, and temperature-dependent field effect techniques have been commonly used for probing traps in field-effect transistors. The PL method is a straight forward technique to investigate the defects in semiconductors. However, the PL method sometime cannot be implemented on a TFT since only a thin region near the surface can be probed for a thick channel layer [13,14,21].
Until recently, only a handful of research studies have been carried out on the determination of sub-gap DOS of ZnO. Lee et_al [15] demonstrated determination of DOS using PECCS from the RF magnetron sputtered ZnO TFTs, where the DOS information was collected by measuring the threshold voltage shift in the photo-electric experiment. Kimura et_al [16] provided CV characterization for trap density extraction for RF magnetron sputtered ZnO TFTs by using the Poisson equation and the carrier density equation. However, no study has been performed on the determination of sub-gap DOSs for sol-gel derived ZnO TFTs. Temperature-dependent field effect measurement based on the Meyer–Neldel (MN) rule has been successfully applied to extract the DOSs of amorphous indium gallium zinc oxide (a-IGZO), zinc tin oxide (ZTO), and Cu_{2}O TFTs [17–20,22,23]. However, it has never been adopted for study of the sol-gel derived ZnO TFTs. Therefore, in this investigation, this technique is applied to extract the DOSs of sol-gel derived ZnO TFTs with different annealing temperatures. We have carried out the measurement in a vacuum to eliminate the effect of oxygen and water molecules, thus providing a more accurate insight into the intrinsic sub-gap trap density. By using temperature-dependent field effect measurement, we not only verified the efficacy of this technique on determination of sub-gap DOSs of sol-gel derived ZnO TFTs, but also investigated the annealing temperature effect on the evolution of sub-gap DOSs.
EXPERIMENTAL
A series of bottom-gate ZnO circular TFTs were fabricated as follows: initially, highly doped p-type Si wafers were dry oxidized to form the oxide layer (gate insulator: SiO_{2}) with a thickness of approximately 170 nm. The sol-gel precursor solution was prepared by dissolving zinc acetate dehydrate in monoethanolamine (MEA) and isopropanol with a 1:1 molar ratio of Zn:MEA. The precursor solution was spin-coated on an oxidized Si wafer at 3000 rpm for 30 s and then the wafer was calcined at 285 °C for 5 min. The process (spin coating followed by calcination) was repeated twice. The thickness of the ZnO layer measured by the Tencor profilometer was 52 nm. The wafer coated with ZnO was diced into four individual pieces and annealed at 600, 700, 800, and 900 °C for 1 h, respectively. A Ti/Pd contact was deposited by direct-current (DC) magnetron sputtering to form the source and drain ohmic contacts. Device isolation was achieved by forming a mesa structure via a wet-chemical etching of the ZnO active layer, which resulted in the reduction of the gate leakage current by more than four orders of magnitude. The length (L) and width (W) of the transistor channel were 80 and 1005 μm, respectively, which correspond to a W/L ratio of 12.56. The bottom of each sample was lightly scratched to remove the unwanted oxidized layer of the Si wafer and Ag paint was applied to attach to a copper tape, serving as the bottom gate. A 2D cross section of the finished device structure is shown in Fig. 1.
Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy was performed at room temperature with a J-Y spectrometer coupled with a continuous wave He-Cd laser with 325 nm line as the excitation source. The thickness of ZnO is 52 nm and the penetration depth of the light at 325 nm is 60 nm, which was calculated from the absorption coefficient reported by Muth et_al [24] Therefore, the UV light from the laser can penetrate the entire thickness of the ZnO film. The c-axis orientation of ZnO with different annealing temperatures was measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D2 Phaser X-ray diffractometer). The surface morphology of deposited ZnO films was also studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-7000F, JEOL, JAPAN).
I-V measurements were carried out in vacuum at various temperatures. A HP 4156A semiconductor parameter analyzer was used. An ARS micro-manipulated cryogenic probe station was used to keep the vacuum pressure at 10^{−4 }Pa. The transfer curve was measured by changing the gate voltage from −50 V to 80 V. V_{DS} was selected as 5 V, where transistors can have a relatively high transfer current and still work in the linear region. In the linear region, the field effect mobility (μ_{FET}) and the subthreshold swing (SS) can be extracted. Room temperature measurements for 10 devices of each annealing temperature are made first, followed by temperature-dependent measurements from 296 K to 330 K for 22 devices totally. In order to eliminate the influence of the contact about the temperature, probes were landed on the metallic contacts and left for 20 minutes to keep the probes and the samples at the same temperature before each measurement.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Figure 2 shows the PL spectra of the ZnO film annealed at 600, 700, 800, and 900 °C for one hour, respectively. The spectra are composed of two distinct bands; UV and visible bands. As can be seen from Fig. 2, the absolute intensity of the UV bands increases as annealing temperature increases. It is known that visible bands are related to intrinsic defects in ZnO films [25,26] and the intensity of this band observed from our spectra is very low.
Figure 3 shows the ratio of integrated intensity ratio of UV to visible band (I_{UV}/I_{VIS}) as a function of the annealing temperature. The ratio increases as annealing temperature increases, which indicates that the quality of ZnO films improves as the annealing temperature increases.
XRD patterns of the ZnO films annealed at 600, 700, 800, and 900 °C are plotted in Fig. 4. The results show that the preferred (002) c-axis orientation is observed and the peak intensity increases with annealing temperature increasing, which is consistent with PL spectra analysis.
The SEM images of the ZnO films annealed at 600, 700, 800, and 900 °C are shown in Fig. 5. The average grain size is increased with the annealing temperatures increasing and hence the amount of grain boundary defects reduced which must have a strong influence on modulating the density of states. The following localized subgap density of states extraction was consistent with SEM analysis. Figures 5(a)–5(c) show uniform and continuous coverage of the ZnO grains. However, Fig. 5(d) shows the non-continuous coverage of the ZnO film.
Figure 6 shows the transfer characteristics of the representative ZnO TFTs annealed at 600, 700, 800, and 900 °C, respectively. The off current which is defined as the drain current before drastically rising with the gate voltage increasing decreases as the annealing temperature increased from 600 °C to 800 °C. In the case of the TFTs with the ZnO layer annealed at 800 and 900 °C, the off current maintains at the level of 10^{−12 }A which can be considered as a noise level. The off current for the 600 °C annealed sample is at the level of 10^{−9 }A, which agrees well with the off current value for 600 °C annealed ZnO TFTs reported by other researchers [12]. However, our optimal TFTs with ZnO annealed at 800 °C exhibit 1000 times lower off current than that reported in the Ref [12]. This indicates that the low off current can be achieved by increasing the annealing temperature. According to the double sweep transfer IV curves, the hysteresis decreases as the annealing temperature increased from 600 °C to 800 °C. However, hysteresis increases with further rising annealing temperature (900 °C). The positive and negative threshold voltages (V_{T}) with different temperature annealed transistors extracted as hysteresis differences [27] are 8.8, 5.9, 3.0, and 5.5 V, respectively.
As is shown in Fig. 7, the turn-on voltage (V_{on}) which is defined as the voltage where the drain current starts to drastically rise as the annealing temperature increases. Both the threshold voltage (V_{T}) and field effect mobility (μ_{FET}) are extracted from the following equation:
where W and L are the width and length of the ZnO channel and C_{SiO2} is the dielectric capacitance per unit area. The threshold voltage (V_{T}) follows the same trend as the turn-on voltage (V_{on}). This trend can be explained as follows: in ZnO, interstitial Zn is considered as the donor. With increasing annealing temperature, more and more interstitial Zn may evaporate [28]. Therefore, a higher annealing temperature leads to less electron carrier density and both V_{on} and V_{T} shift to a positive direction as the annealing temperature increases.
The sub-threshold swing (SS) can be extracted at the steepest point of the transfer IV curves in log scale using the following equation:
The SS decreases from 2.78 V/decade to 1.42 V/decade with increasing annealing temperature. The interface trap density (D_{it}) was determined by using the following simplified equation [29]:
where q is the electronic charge and k_{B} is the Boltzmann constant. Figure 8 shows the plot of the D_{it} of ZnO TFTs with different annealing temperatures. It shows that the corresponding D_{it} decreases from 5.9 × 10^{12} eV^{−1 }cm^{−2} to 2.9 × 10^{12} eV^{−1 }cm^{−2} as annealing temperature increases from 600 °C to 800 °C. When the annealing temperature reaches 900 °C, D_{it} keeps the same level as 800 °C. From SS and D_{it} analysis, it can be concluded that the interface trap density decreased with increasing annealing temperature, thus improving the TFT electrical characteristics. This conclusion can be further consolidated from the analysis of localized sub-gap DOSs through temperature dependent I-V measurements which is discussed below.
Since the ZnO TFTs have different V_{T}, the field effect mobility (μ_{FET}) was extracted and plotted in Fig. 9 under the same electron concentration (same V_{GS} − V_{T}). It shows that as annealing temperature increases, μ_{FET} rises more than two times at each annealing temperature. However, when the annealing temperature is 900 °C, μ_{FET} drops abruptly to the value obtained between 600 and 700 °C annealing temperature and the transistor output current (shown in Fig. 10) drops to the value obtained at 700 °C annealing temperature. As can be seen from the plot, the highest mobility was achieved with an 800 °C anneal.
In order to determine the sub-gap DOSs, temperature-dependent I-V measurements were performed. The I_{D} versus V_{GS} for over 20 TFTs with channel layers annealed at different temperatures were collected by changing the measurement temperature between 296 and 330 K. Figure 11 shows I_{D} − V_{GS} for ZnO TFTs fabricated with different annealing temperatures. For each annealing temperature, one representative data set was chosen for plotting. As can be seen from Fig. 11, I_{D} for ZnO TFTs under the same V_{GS} shifts systematically as the measurement temperature increases, which indicates that the conduction process in these TFTs is thermally activated and the temperature-dependent I-V data can be used to determine the localized sub-gap DOSs [17,18]. Then, the I_{D} (especially in subthreshold regime) should obey the Arrhenius equation as follows [17,18,30,31]:
where I_{DP} is a pre-factor, E_{a} is the activation energy, and T is the measurement temperature, respectively. From the plot of I_{D} (in log scale) versus 1/k_{B}T in Fig. 12, E_{a} and I_{DP} for different annealing temperatures can be extracted by linear fits to the data. The activation energy E_{a} represents the average energy of electrons escaping from the localized sub-gap states and this is the difference between the conduction band minimum (E_{C}) and the Fermi level (E_{F}), as shown in Fig. 13.
In Figs. 14 and 15, both E_{a} and I_{DP} have an independent relation with V_{GS}. And they change significantly in the subthreshold regime and very little in the above threshold voltage regime. As can be seen from the Fig. 14, E_{a} drops rapidly as V_{GS} increases, which implies that the Fermi level E_{F} moves closer to E_{C} as V_{GS} is increased. The E_{F} variation is related to the DOS spread close to the E_{C}, which makes the determination of the localized sub-gap DOS possible. The Meyer–Neldel (MN) rule widely observed in the intrinsic material property study is also obeyed by the relation between E_{a} and I_{DP} in Fig. 16, which is described as follows [17,18]:
where I_{DPP} is the pre-factor of I_{DP} and A is the MN parameter. We can see that A and I_{DPP} have constant values in the subthreshold regime. However, A and I_{DPP} vary and A becomes smaller in the above threshold regime. As a result, for each annealing temperature, A and I_{DPP} have two defined regions which correspond to the deep states region (subthreshold regime) and the band tail region (above threshold regime). In order to simplify the DOS calculation, we used two defined values of both A and I_{DPP} for the deep states region and the band tail region, as was employed by Chen et_al [17] for each annealing temperature TFT (Shown in Fig. 16).
The procedures Chen et_al, Jeong et_al, and Kim et_al used to calculate the DOSs of a-IGZO TFTs were adopted [17,18,32] to extract the sub-gap density of states (DOSs) for ZnO TFTs with different annealing temperatures. By combining Eqs. (4) and (5), the expression for I_{D} at a specific V_{GS} point can be rewritten as follows [17]:
where β=1k_{B}T. According to Fig. 13, E_{a} is determined by both V_{GS} and the distance x of the interface between ZnO and SiO_{2}. As a result, the extracted thermal activation energy at a specific V_{GS} point [E_{a}(V_{GS})] in Fig. 14 can be treated as the average effect on I_{D} created by the thermal activation energy along x (E_{a}(x)). Then, I_{D}(V_{GS}) can be described as below [17]
where d_{ZnO} is the thickness of the ZnO channel layer. E_{a}(x) can also be written as E_{aFB}-Ψ_{ZnO}(x), where E_{aFB} is the activation energy under flat band condition and Ψ_{ZnO}(x) is the band bending. By combining with Eq. (7), the expression for I_{D} can be rewritten as follows [17]:
where I_{FB} is the flat band current which can be written as follows [17]:
In order to determine Ψ_{ZnO}(x) and the corresponding charge density (n_{ZnO}(x)) caused by the density of states in the ZnO channel layer [33], the Poisson equation needs to be satisfied in the electric field with varying V_{GS}. The corresponding Poisson equation can be written as follows [17]:
where q is the absolute value of the electronic charge, ε_{ZnO} is the dielectric constant of ZnO, and ε_{0} is the permittivity in vacuum. By using Chen et_al's self-consistent procedure, we can derive the expression for the surface band bending (Ψ_{ZnO_S} (V_{F})) as follows [17,18]:
where V_{F} is the difference between V_{GS} and the flat band voltage (V_{FB}), d_{SiO2} and ε_{SiO2} are the thickness and dielectric constant of the SiO_{2} layer, respectively. Meanwhile, the corresponding surface charge density (n_{ZnO_S}(Ψ_{ZnO})) can be presented as [17,18]
Then, the calculated Ψ_{ZnO_S}(V_{F}) and n_{ZnO_S}(Ψ_{ZnO}) under the subthreshold regime for different annealing temperatures are plotted in Figs. 17 and 18, respectively. Ψ_{ZnO_S}(V_{F}) increases with the same V_{F} as the annealing temperature increases from 600 °C to 800 °C, and the Ψ_{ZnO_S}(V_{F}) remains at the same level of values between 800 and 900 °C. In Fig. 18, n_{ZnO_S}(Ψ_{ZnO_S}) has the opposite trend as the annealing temperature changes from 600 °C to 800 °C, and it keeps the same level between 800 and 900 °C as well. However, the calculated Ψ_{ZnO_S}(V_{F}) and n_{ZnO_S}(Ψ_{ZnO_S}) above the threshold regime does not follow the same trend. Since the DOS calculation in this regime cannot be valid as will be explained later, the corresponding Ψ_{ZnO_S}(V_{F}) and n_{ZnO_S}(Ψ_{ZnO_S}) plots are not included in this paper. In addition, the appropriate V_{FB} should be determined in order to extract valid Ψ_{ZnO_S}, n_{ZnO_S} and the corresponding DOS which will be discussed later. By comparing the calculated activation energy (E_{acal}) with the experimental activation energy (E_{a}), we can choose the suitable V_{FB} for the extraction of Ψ_{ZnO_S} and n_{ZnO_S}. The E_{acal} equation is described as follows [17,18]:
where E_{aFB} is the flat band energy and can be rewritten from Eq. (9)
The I_{FB} can be directly obtained by interpolation at V_{FB} from I_{D}. From Fig. 14, a proper V_{FB} was chosen for each ZnO TFT with different annealing temperatures, and E_{acal} was well matched with E_{a}. The calculated pre-factor (I_{DPcal}) derived from E_{acal} is written as [17]
which is also consistent with I_{DP} in Fig. 15. The corresponding MN rule for E_{acal} and I_{DPcal} is consistent with the one for E_{a} and I_{DP}, as is shown in Fig. 16. After choosing the proper V_{FB}, the final DOS distribution D(E) can be extracted under the assumption of 0-Kelvin Fermi statistics from the following expression [17,18]:
Finally, DOSs were calculated for both the subthreshold and above threshold regimes for all ZnO TFTs with different annealing temperatures and were plotted in Figs. 19 and 20. As can be seen in Fig. 19, the DOSs calculated in the subthreshold regime reduces as the annealing temperature increases from 600 °C to 800 °C and the DOSs keep the same value between 800 and 900 °C, which is consistent with the D_{it}, as is analyzed before. Compared with D_{it}, which shows only the qualitative interface trap density information, the extracted D (E) provides the localized subgap states energy distributions [34].
According to Chen et_al, the DOSs extracted from the above threshold regime cannot be valid due to the following reasons [17]: first, the free carrier concentration which was ignored in Eq. (16) for calculating the DOSs in the subthreshold regime should be considered for extracting DOSs from above threshold regime. Second, the characteristic energy is too close to the measuring temperature. As a result, the 0-Kelvin Fermi statistics assumption would introduce an error when calculating the final results. Regardless of these limitations, DOS extraction in the above threshold regime can still offer a deep intuitive understanding of the annealing temperature effect on the electrical properties of ZnO TFTs. As is presented in Fig. 20, the calculated DOSs in the above threshold regime are larger than those determined from the subthreshold regime and exhibit a decreasing trend with increasing annealing temperature.
According to the experimental results obtained, it was found that increasing annealing temperature can improve the crystal quality of ZnO and reduce the DOSs, this also results in the field effect mobility increasing [35], but annealing at a very high temperature (i.e., 900 °C) will not further improve the performance of ZnO TFTs and can even cause the degradation. It was hypothesized that a very high temperature annealing can be detrimental due to the following reasons: (1) interstitial Zn may evaporate at a temperature above 800 °C, resulting in the reduction of the concentration of electrons produced by ionization of Zn interstitials [28]. (2) Annealing in the oxidizing atmosphere can fill oxygen vacancies which act as donors and reduce the charge carrier concentration [36,37], thus reducing electrical conductivity and increasing the threshold voltage [37]. (3) Electron mobility can be reduced from very high temperature annealing. The SEM image shows non-continuous film coverage for the samples annealed at 900 °C, which can be used to explain the electron mobility degradation. Combined with the I-V analysis and the results of DOS calculation, it can be tentatively concluded that 800 °C annealing temperature can generate the highest quality of ZnO film with the lowest DOSs and TFT with the highest mobility.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
The ZnO channel layers were deposited on an oxidized Si wafer via the sol-gel process and were annealed at different temperatures. It was found that the annealing temperature greatly affects the performance of sol-gel derived ZnO TFTs. With increasing annealing temperature, the crystallite size became larger and the amount of grain boundary defects reduced, which must have a strong influence on modulating the density of states, V_{on} (and V_{T}) increase, and drastic off current drop. The SS and corresponding D_{it} decrease as the annealing temperature increases. However, the μ_{FET} and the output current peak at 800 °C and drop upon further temperature increase. The temperature dependent field effect measurement was used to gain an insight into the annealing temperature effect on ZnO TFT electrical characteristics. By combining the MN rule and applying the self-consistent procedure in a-IGZO TFTs analysis, the DOSs of sol-gel derived ZnO TFTs with different annealing temperatures were successfully extracted. The results show that DOSs decrease with annealing temperature increase in general, but too high of a temperature anneal may not be beneficial in reducing DOSs. It was found that the TFT with ZnO layers annealed at 800 °C for one hour shows the best electrical performance.
