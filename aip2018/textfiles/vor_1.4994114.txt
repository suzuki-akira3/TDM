Carrier polarity engineering in carbon nanotube field-effect transistors by induced charges in polymer insulator
We present that the electrical conduction type in carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNT-FETs) can be converted by induced charges in a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) insulator. When the CNT channels are covered with pure PVA, the FET characteristics clearly change from unipolar p-type to ambipolar. The addition of ammonium ions (NH_{4}^{+}) in the PVA leads to further conversion to unipolar n-type conduction. The capacitance − voltage characteristics indicate that a high density of positive charges is induced at the PVA/SiO_{2} interface and within the bulk PVA. Electrons are electrostatically accumulated in the CNT channels due to the presence of the positive charges, and thus, stable n-type conduction of PVA-coated CNT-FETs is observed, even under ambient conditions. The mechanism for conversion of the conduction type is considered to be electrostatic doping due to the large amount of positive charges in the PVA. A blue-shift of the Raman G-band peak was observed for CNTs coated with NH_{4}^{+}-doped PVA, which corresponds to unipolar n-type CNT-FET behavior. These results confirm that carrier polarity engineering in CNT-FETs can be achieved with a charged PVA passivation layer.
Because carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNT-FETs) generally exhibit p-type behavior, n-type conversion is an important target. The p-type to n-type conversion has been reported through approaches such as the use of low work function metal electrodes [1–5], high-κ materials as gate dielectrics or passivation layers [6–10], chemical doping (e.g., potassium [11,12], viologen [13,14], organorhodium [15], ethanolamine [16], and tetrafluorotetracyano-p-quinodimethane [17,18]), and polymer coatings. More recently, solid-state oxide doping is reported as a new type of doping technique, which utilizes electron transfer when a metal is oxidized [19,20]. Among these, the polymer coating technique is a promising low-cost approach (room temperature and atmospheric pressure processes) to fabricating transparent and flexible CNT-FETs [21–23]. When a CNT-FET is covered by an amine-rich polymer such as polyethylene imine, n-type conduction is observed [24–28], whereas for a CNT-FET passivated with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) [29,30], polyethylene oxide [31], polyacrylic acid [32], or poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) [33], the conduction type does not change. This phenomenon could be attributed to charge transfer between the CNTs and the polymer molecules; however, the mechanism for this conversion has yet to be clearly determined.
It has been reported that charge transfer occurs when electron donating molecules are adsorbed on the surfaces of CNTs. However, theoretical studies have revealed that the charge transfer effect is rather weak due to non-covalent bonding with the CNT surface [34–36]. In addition, the charge transfer distance between a CNT and non-covalently attached NH_{3} molecules is considerably shorter (0.29 nm) [37] than the water depletion layer thickness for a CNT (0.84 nm) [38]. Charge carriers are therefore difficult to transfer to CNTs from non-covalently bonded molecules. We have previously reported conduction-type conversion in both CNT-FETs and graphene FETs after polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) coating [39,40]. Observation of an electron current in CNT-FETs and a shift of the Dirac point in graphene FETs are considered to be caused by electron doping in their channels. However, the detailed mechanism for electronic conduction due to the PVA coating has not been elucidated. Here, we investigate the mechanism for conduction-type conversion in a CNT-FET by PVA coating in terms of the induced charges in a PVA film.
Figures 1(a) and 1(b) show a schematic illustration of a PVA-coated CNT-FET and a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the channel region. The fabrication and characterization methods can be found in the supplementary material. For the growth conditions and device dimensions used in this study (channel length L = 10 μm and electrode width W = 5 μm), the number of CNT channels was one or two [41]. The influence of the PVA coating on the channel region is clearly reflected by the electrical properties of the CNT-FET [Fig. 1(c)]. Prior to PVA coating, the FET exhibited unipolar p-type conduction, and no electron current flow occurred in the positive gate voltage (V_{G}) region under the measurement conditions used. In contrast, an electron current was observed after the PVA coating, similar to our previous report [39]. This ambipolar conversion is reproducible, and similar trends were observed in all FETs fabricated in this work.
The field-effect mobility in the linear regime (μ_{FE}) was estimated in both cases using the following equation:
where C_{ox} is the capacitance per unit area, which in this case is estimated to be 5.76 × 10^{−9 }F/cm^{2} based on a dielectric constant of 3.9 for SiO_{2}. For the uncoated CNT-FET, μ_{FE} is 81.2 cm^{2}/Vs, while for the PVA-coated CNT-FET, μ_{FE} for holes and electrons is estimated to be 26.1 and 42.4 cm^{2}/Vs, respectively. The degradation of the hole mobility will be discussed in another report in order to further clarify the carrier transport mechanism. The subthreshold swing (ss) for the uncoated FET, hole accumulation, and electron accumulation regimes for the PVA-coated FET is 0.6, 0.45, and 0.75 V/dec, respectively. This slight improvement in the ss for the hole accumulation regime, despite a decrease in μ_{FE}, will be discussed later. In the case of back and forth sweep I_{D}–V_{G} measurements, hysteresis behavior was observed for both the uncoated and PVA-coated FETs (Fig. S1, supplementary material).
To elucidate the conduction-type conversion in terms of impurity charges, capacitor structures with and without a PVA layer were fabricated, and the charge densities in the PVA bulk and at the PVA/SiO_{2} interface were then estimated. Figure 2(a) shows the capacitance–voltage (C–V) characteristics of the capacitors with and without a PVA layer. The details of the device fabrication and characterization are presented in the supplementary material. The flatband voltage (V_{FB}) was estimated by the flatband capacitance (C_{FB}) method [9]. In the case of the PVA/SiO_{2} stacked capacitor, V_{FB} can be represented by
where ϕ_{ms} is the work-function difference between the metal (Au) and the semiconductor (p-Si), ε_{ox} is the permittivity of SiO_{2}, ρ_{PVA} is the bulk charge density in the PVA, Q_{PVA} and Q_{SiO2} are the charge densities at the PVA/SiO_{2} and SiO_{2}/p-Si interfaces, respectively, and t_{PVA} and t_{SiO2} are the thicknesses of the PVA and SiO_{2} insulators, respectively. The details of Eq. (2) for a stacked capacitor are described in the supplementary material (Fig. S2, supplementary material). The two capacitors of SiO_{2} and PVA are connected in series; therefore, C_{FB} with the PVA layer (C_{FB,PVA}) is given by
where C_{PVA} is the capacitance of the PVA, which is determined by C_{PVA} = ε_{0}ε_{PVA}/t_{PVA}. Here, the dielectric constant for the PVA (ε_{PVA}) is estimated to be 5.6 using a Au/PVA (1.81 μm)/SiO_{2} (235 nm)/p^{++}-Si structure, where the capacitance of the PVA was measured to be 27.6 pF/mm^{2} (Fig. S3, supplementary material). Figure 2(b) shows the relationship between V_{FB} and the PVA thickness with the best fitted quadratic curve. Using Q_{SiO2} (−8.7 × 10^{11} cm^{−2}) calculated from the relationship between V_{FB} and Q_{SiO2} in the case of the Au/SiO_{2}/p-Si capacitor (calculation details shown in Fig. S4 and Table S1 of the supplementary material), ρ_{PVA} and Q_{PVA} were estimated to be 3.6 × 10^{15} cm^{−3} and 5.4× 10^{11} cm^{−2}, respectively. This ρ_{PVA} value corresponds to an areal density of 10^{11} cm^{−2} (the PVA thickness in this study is ca. 1 μm), which is considerably high for a bulk charge density. The bulk charge density in thermally grown SiO_{2} is typically negligible when compared with the interface charge density. However, the PVA has a high density of positive bulk charge; therefore, we focused on the bulk charge in addition to the interface charge density. The electrostatic force microscopy measurement to quantify the amount of bulk and surface charges supports our observation and characterization [42,43].
The ambipolar conversion of the PVA-coated CNT-FET was considered in terms of the high density of positive charges within the PVA bulk and at the PVA/SiO_{2} interface. Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show schematic cross-sectional diagrams of the CNT-FET when negative and positive V_{G} are applied, respectively. In the case of V_{G} < V_{th}, holes are accumulated in the semiconducting CNT channel [Fig. 3(c)], similar to the case for an uncoated CNT-FET; however, the accumulated carrier density is slightly suppressed in comparison with that for uncoated FETs due to the presence of electrons in the CNT channel induced by the positive bulk and interfacial charges. In addition, the CNT channel is not placed on the PVA but surrounded by the PVA, and the surrounding structure enhances carrier accumulation. The positive charges in the PVA quickly deplete the accumulated holes, so that ss is strongly dependent on V_{G}. With the improvement in ss due to the PVA coating effects, V_{th} is negatively shifted and the on-state current is slightly decreased, as shown in Fig. 1(c). This behavior can be explained by the electrostatic doping of electrons in the CNT channel due to the surrounding PVA with positive charges. In contrast, when V_{G} > V_{th} [Fig. 3(d)], electrons are accumulated in the CNT channel because of the bulk and interfacial charges; therefore, an electron current was observed.
If the positive charge density is further increased, then the hole current is possibly reduced, and unipolar n-type conduction would be realized [44]. Here, the ammonium ion (NH_{4}^{+}) was selected as an additive and it was added into the PVA (denoted as PVA:NH_{4}^{+}) for conversion to unipolar n-type conduction. Figure 4(a) shows the transfer characteristics of the CNT-FET before and after the PVA:NH_{4}^{+} coating. The hole current in the FET is completely suppressed, and the electrical behavior is clearly converted to unipolar n-type from p-type. The n-type operation was stable under ambient conditions, which could be attributed to the dense PVA matrix where NH_{4}^{+} is well embedded in the polymer chain and the dense matrix prevents reaction with the ambient air. NH_{4}^{+} can act as a proton donor in PVA; therefore, the capacitance behavior of the PVA:NH_{4}^{+} layer should be different from that of the undoped PVA [Fig. 2(a)]. The C–V characteristics shown in Fig. 4(b) indicate that the PVA:NH_{4}^{+} is more positively charged because of the existence of a small increase in the capacitance at the positive bias applications, which results in the suppression of hole accumulation in the CNT channel caused by the Fermi level (E_{F}) shift toward the conduction band edge. Peng et_al suggested that the E_{F} shift can be attributed to charge transfer between the CNTs and adsorbed NH_{3} [45]. However, the NH_{3}−CNT interaction is very weak, so that charge transfer is possibly difficult to occur between them [34,36]. Even if NH_{3} gas is diffused out from PVA and the gas molecules adsorb on defect sites of CNTs, NH_{3} cannot bind to the surface, even at room temperature and despite the existence of dangling bonds, due to the low adsorption energy of NH_{3} [46]. Furthermore, in the case of NH_{3} dissolved in water, the device sensitivity to NH_{3} is pronounced because NH_{3} in the gaseous and aqueous phases causes different device responses [45,47]. This situation is similar to the PVA-coated CNT-FET structure where the PVA layer includes water molecules. In this case, NH_{3} is ionized to NH_{4}^{+} and the surrounding water layer is positively charged; therefore, the E_{F} shift is electrostatically induced by the surrounding charges. This is consistent with electron injection at the contact interface due to the change in the Schottky barrier height (SBH), as reported previously [48–50]. Positive charges in the PVA induce electron accumulation in the CNT channel and generate negative charges at the interface between the CNT channel and the CNT electrode. The electron accumulation is caused by E_{F} shift, while the presence of negative charges modulates SBH at the interface, according to the quantitative characterization [48]. Even with the CNT-CNT contact configuration used in this study, this modulation can be considered to be similar to that for a conventional metal-CNT contact [51]. The difference of the doping mechanism between charge transfer and electrostatic doping is that charge carriers move to the nearest neighbor or remain on the initial material. In the former, charges directly contribute to carriers; in contrast, charges induce opposite carriers across an insulating barrier layer in the latter. Thus, we consider that the n-type behavior can also be explained by electrostatic doping rather than by charge transfer.
When a CNT-FET was coated with a negatively charged polymer such as PMMA, the FET behavior maintained the initial p-type conduction (Fig. S5, supplementary material), suggesting that the density of the bulk/interfacial charges and the polarity of the polymer are very important for controlling the conduction type of CNT-FETs. The obtained conduction type was opposite to the polarity of the charged polymer, which indicates that the conversion mechanism is electrostatic doping. If charge transfer occurs between CNT and PVA molecules, then PVA with positive charges must enhance the initial p-type conduction.
Finally, Raman spectra of the CNTs were measured in order to investigate the influence of the PVA coating. PVA-embedded CNT films were prepared for Raman spectroscopy measurements using a peel-off method, which is described in the supplementary material. Figure 5 shows Raman spectra of the as-grown CNTs on the SiO_{2}/Si substrate and for CNT films embedded in PVA and PVA:NH_{4}^{+}. These spectra indicate that the G-peak position, originally at 1594 cm^{−1}, is blue-shifted by ca. 3 cm^{−1} with an increase in the density of electron accumulation, while there was no change in the peak width. The wavelength resolution with this Raman equipment at around 1590 cm^{−1} is 1.5 cm^{−1}; therefore, the blue-shift in the G-peak is reasonable. The shift of the G-peak with increasing accumulated carrier density occurs with both holes and electrons and is due to a change in electron-phonon interactions [52,53]. The Raman results for the PVA:NH_{4}^{+}-embedded CNTs are consistent with the FET properties. More positive charge doping in PVA is expected to induce more electron accumulation in a CNT channel, and consequently, the E_{F} shift causes a blue-shift of the G phonons. According to the calculation by Tsang et_al for a semiconducting CNT with a diameter of 2.5 nm, a Raman shift of 3 cm^{−1} at room temperature corresponds to a doping level of ca. 0.2% (1 electron per 500 carbon atoms) [52]. The average diameter of the CNTs used in this work was expectedly smaller than 2.0 nm. A smaller diameter widens the bandgap; therefore, a doping concentration of more than 0.2% was possibly achieved in this case. This doping concentration can move E_{F} by ca. 0.3 eV toward the conduction band edge [54]. This modulation of E_{F} is considered to be small for electrostatic conversion from unipolar p-type to n-type conduction [9]. However, the sample structure used for the Raman characterization is not exactly the same as that for the FET measurement; therefore, the impact on the interfacial charges (i.e., Q_{PVA} in the FET structure shown in Fig. 3) may be reduced. This is the reason why the G-peak position for the PVA-embedded CNTs appears to be the same as that for the as-grown film, although electron conduction was observed in the PVA-coated FETs. To discuss the correlation between the FET behavior and the G-peak shift in more detail, the effect of impurity charges originating from the device structure must also be considered.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the conduction type in CNT-FETs can be converted using a positively charged PVA coating. When the CNT channel was covered by pure PVA, the conduction type changed from unipolar p-type to ambipolar. Based on C–V measurements, the PVA has high positive charge densities in the bulk and at the PVA/SiO_{2} interface, which suggests that electrons are accumulated in the CNT channel electrostatically. To suppress the hole current in the PVA-coated CNT-FETs, NH_{4}^{+} was added into the PVA solution to increase the positive charge density. A unipolar n-type CNT-FET was then demonstrated at room temperature under ambient conditions. This ability to control the conduction type can be explained in terms of electrostatic doping. The PVA-NH_{4}^{+}-treated CNT film caused a shift of E_{F}, and consequently, a blue-shift of the Raman G-band peak was observed consistent with the FET behavior. We consider that the present approach would be useful for electrostatic control and conversion of the conduction type of CNT-FETs using a PVA-based passivation layer, which could lead to the realization of flexible and transparent pn complementary circuits composed of all-carbon materials.
