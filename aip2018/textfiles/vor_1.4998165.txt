The effects of geometrical configurations on the head collision on nonlinear solitary pulses in a quantum semiconductor plasma: A case study on GaAs semiconductor
An investigation is presented to examine nonlinear electrostatic waves in a quantum semiconductor plasma. A quantum semiconductor plasma model consisting of electrons and holes is going to be used, which includes exchange–correlation potentials, the quantum recoil effect, and degenerate pressures of electrons and holes. Actually, a nonlinear solitary pulse can be used to represent the intrinsic coherent electrostatic wave in a quantum semiconductor plasma. The propagation and the collision of nonlinear solitary pulses are examined by the extended Poincaré-Lighthill-Kuo method. Typical values for the GaAs semiconductors are employed to investigate the basic characteristics of solitary pulses. The numerical studies show that the energies and then the trajectories of nonlinear solitary pulses after the collision are significantly changed due to the effects of the exchange and correlation potentials and the variety in the studied system's geometry. The results obtained here may be useful for gaining a better understanding of the basic features of the nonlinear solitary pulses in quantum semiconductor plasmas.
I. INTRODUCTION
The fast growth of laser technology has recently provided excellent opportunities to generate new laser sources of femtosecond and intense pulses [1–4]. Accordingly, the interaction between powerful laser beams and matter, such as plasmas in quantum regimes, has opened a new field of modern research. In fact, the intense laser-high density plasma interactions can create an electron-hole semiconductor plasma regime, where electrons absorb energy from incident photons to transit from the valence band to the conduction band with holes created in the valence band. Therefore, the dense plasma has attracted much attention due to its potential applications in different modern scientific areas such as in semiconductor devices, carbon nanotubes, quantum diodes, quantum computers, ultra-cold plasmas, and intense laser-solid density plasma experiments [5–8]. In particular, much attention has been given for the miniaturization of electronic devices to semiconductor nanostructures that operate with electron/hole transport in nanoscale sizes. Consequently, tremendous advancements have been made in performing theoretical investigations of quantum semiconductor plasmas in recent years [9–13]. One of the most important characteristics of dense plasmas is that, besides the strong interactions between like-charged particles that repel each other, there are also attractive forces between two like-charged particles, such as electrons/holes, because of the overlapping wavefunctions due to high number density. Therefore, a long-range attractive potential is expected to play a crucial role in the propagation of nonlinear waves in a quantum semiconductor plasma. It is well known that the generalized quantum hydrodynamical model (QHDM) contains the degenerate pressure and the Bohm potential, as well as the long-range behaviour of electron/hole exchange-correlation potential. Generally, the exchange-correlation functional is divided into an exchange part and a correlation functional: E_{xc} = E_{x} + E_{c}, where E_{x} includes the energetic contribution due to the antisymmetry requirement imposed upon the many-body wavefunction. In addition, the correlation energy E_{c} is known as the missing energy needed to make E_{xc} exact. Furthermore, the exchange-correlation potential is defined as the functional derivative of E_{xc} with respect to the electron density [14,15]. In general, it is obvious that the electric potential, resulting from the static electron/hole dielectric constant that involves the collective effects of density perturbations associated with the degenerate pressure, the quantum force and the electron/hole exchange-correlation effects including the overlapping of the electron/hole wavefunctions due to the Heisenberg uncertainty and Pauli's exclusion principles and half-integer spin electrons/holes, creates a short-range electric potential [16,17]. It is necessary to mention here that the local-density approximation (LDA) is a kind of approximation that is employed to obtain the electron exchange—correlation energy functional as a function of electron density. In most cases, the contribution of the electron exchange—correlation potential term may be neglected, but due to the rapid growth and the great degree of miniaturization to a size of today's electronic components, whose density (temperature) is so high (low) that it leads to the exchange correlation effect, it is said to have a handy role and cannot be neglected.
In recent years, nonlinear solitary waves have great significance in the modern research of plasma physics, in particular, for quantum semiconductor plasmas and their technology. It is well known that a nonlinear solitary wave is created in a plasma due to a balance between nonlinear steepening and dispersion, and it has a permanent shape after mutual collisions [18]. Clearly, the unique effect due to the interaction between nonlinear solitary waves is the change in its phase shift. On one hand, the nonlinear solitary waves have been experimentally carried out for a number of materials and semiconductors such as: MgO, Al_{2}O_{3}, Si, SiO_{2}, and GaAs [19–26]. On the other hand, the characteristics of nonlinear solitary waves in different semiconductor systems are theoretically examined [27–32]. For example, Moslem et_al [29] demonstrated that the degenerate pressures have a strong effect in reducing the amplitude and the width of the solitary wave more than any other quantum effects. Wang and Lü [30] studied the modulational instability of quantum electrostatic acoustic waves in a dense plasma. They found that the damping rate depends on the quantum effects, the electron/hole effective masses, and the electron/hole–phonon collision frequencies. Recently, Wang and Eliasson [31] demonstrated that the numerical simulations of the rarefactive solitons are stable and can withstand perturbations and turbulence for considerable time in a quantum semiconductor plasma. It is essential to mention here that most of the previous works [27–32] are limited to one-dimensional planar geometry, except for the work done by El-Shamy and Gohman [32] who have studied the collision of soliton rings in an electron–hole semiconductor plasma. They [32] stated that the degenerate pressures of electrons and holes play a significant role in the phase shift of solitary waves after the collision. Very recently, Tolba et_al [33] have used the plasma parameters of the GaN semiconductor plasma to show negative potentials of the obtained pulses (i.e., soliton-cnoidal, soliton, and periodic waves) in the quantum semiconductor plasma. However, understanding the basic features due to the interactions of planar and nonplanar nonlinear solitary pulses in a dense semiconductor plasma consisting of electrons and holes is still lacking. It should also be mentioned here that most of the previous investigations are limited to the unbounded one-dimensional planar geometry [27–31]. Certainly, such an approach is not in a realistic manner in physical and laboratory frames. Therefore, the main purpose of the presented theoretical model is to study the propagation and the collision, using the extended Poincaré-Lighthill-Kuo (PLK) method [27–33], of the nonlinear planar/nonplanar solitary pulses in a dense semiconductor plasma system. This paper is organized in the following manner: In Sec. II, the basic equations that govern the propagation and collision of solitons in quantum semiconductor plasmas are introduced. Furthermore, using the extended PLK method, the two coupled Korteweg–de Vries (KdV) equations, the analytical phase shifts and the trajectories after the collision are deduced in Sec. III. Based on the physical parameters taken from GaAs semiconductors, Sec. III is devoted to show numerical illustrations and the discussion.
II. BASIC SET OF EQUATIONS
We consider two fluid planar/nonplanar homogeneous quantum semiconductor plasmas consisting of electrons and holes. In the present model, the quantum mechanical effects have been taken into account in the dynamic equation of electrons and holes by inclusion of the exchange-correlation forces that occur only between identical particles, the degenerate pressure because of Fermionic nature of electrons and holes, and the quantum recoil force associated with the Bohm potential due to the electrons and holes tunneling through a potential barrier. The one-dimensional continuity and momentum equations for electrons and holes can be written as [28,32]
These equations are coupled through Poisson's equation
Here, n_{e}, n_{h}, u_{e}, and u_{h} are, respectively, the densities and the velocities of electrons and holes, and ϕ is the electrostatic potential, where ν is the geometrical parameter, ν = 0 for planar geometry, and ν =1(2) for a nonplanar cylindrical (spherical) geometry. The exchange-correlation potentials are defined as V_{xce,h}=−0.985e^{2}/ϵne,h1/31+0.034/aBe,h*ne,h1/3ln(1+18.376aBe,h*ne,h1/3), the degenerate pressure P_{e,h}=K_{e,h}ne,h5/3 is used to derive the pressure term σ_{e,h}ne,h−1/3∂n_{e,h}∂r, where K_{e,h}=5/3π/3{1/3}πℏ^{2}/me,h*, and the term 2He,h2∂∂rνr∂∂rn_{e,h}+∂^{2}∂r^{2}n_{e,h}n_{e,h} represents Bohm potential due to the quantum tunneling effect. The charge neutrality condition reads as n_{e0}=n_{h0}=n_{0}, where n_{e0}n_{h0} is the unperturbed electron(hole) density and n_{0} is a common density. The physical quantities n_{e,h},u_{e,h},ϕ,r, and t are normalized by n_{e,h0},V_{Fe}, k_{B}T_{Fe}/e,λ_{DFe}, and ωpe−1, respectively. Now, let us introduce the following notations: for electrons, μ_{e}=−1γ_{e}=1/k_{B}T_{Fe}, σ{e}=π/3{1/3}πℏ^{2}/me*ne02/3/k_{B}T_{Fe},aBe*=ϵℏ^{2}/me*e^{2} and H_{e}=ℏω_{pe}/2k_{B}T_{Fe}, and for holes, μ_{h}=me*/mh*,γ_{h}=μ/k_{B}T_{Fh}, σ_{h}=π/3{1/3}πℏ^{2}/mh*nh02/3/k_{B}T_{Fh},aBh*=ϵℏ^{2}/mh*e^{2}, and H_{h}=ℏω_{pe}/2k_{B}T_{Fh}μ. The Fermi electron speed V_{Fe} is given by k_{B}T_{Fe}/me*, the electron plasma frequency ω_{pe}, and the Fermi electron Debye radius are defined as 4πe^{2}n_{e0}/me* and k_{B}T_{Fe}/4πe^{2}n_{e0}, respectively. Furthermore, me*,T{Fe}mh*,T{Fh} are, respectively, the electron (hole) effective mass and the Fermi temperature of the electron (hole), ℏ is the Planck constant divided by 2π, ϵ is the dielectric constant of the material, e is the magnitude of the electron charge, and k_{B} is the Boltzmann constant.
To examine the interaction between different geometrical configurations of solitary waves in electron-hole semiconductor quantum plasmas, let us consider two solitary pulses that are initially far apart and then progress toward each other. After some time, they interact and then depart. In fact, the extended PLK perturbation method is an appropriate method to study the interaction of solitary waves in various models of plasmas [34–43]. It should be mentioned here that one of the most interesting features of solitary waves is related to the asymptotic preservation of their forms (i.e., they are stable entities and preserve their identities) during their interactions with each other. However, they undergo a change in energy, and hence trajectories (i.e., phase shifts). To describe the interaction of nonlinear solitary pulses in a quantum semiconductor plasma, we apply the extended PLK method through the stretched coordinates
where λ is the phase velocity of the pulse to be determined later, and ε is a smallness parameter measuring the strength of the nonlinearity. The dependent variables are expanded in the following form:
Substituting the stretched variables ξ, η, and R, and physical quantities n_{e},n_{h},u_{e},u_{h}, and ϕ into Eqs. (1)–(3), the following relations are obtained for the lowest nonzero order in ε:
Using Eqs. (9)–(12) in the lowest nonzero order in Eq. (3), the pulse phase velocity is given by
Furthermore, at the next order of ε, we obtain the second order perturbed quantities (given in Appendix A). Moreover, at the next higher order of ε, one can obtain the third order perturbed quantities. Using the first- and second-order solutions and after some algebraic steps, one can arrive at the Korteweg–de Vries (KdV) equations and two leading equations for the phase shifts
where the coefficients A, B, C, and D are given in Appendix B. For large R, the asymptotic solitary wave solutions of Eqs. (14) and (15) are given by [38–40,44]
where ϕ11=ϕ_{1}, and ϕ21=ϕ_{2},φ_{1} and φ_{2} are, respectively, the amplitudes of two solitary pulses ϕ_{1} and ϕ_{2} at the initial positions, Θ_{1}(=R_{1}/R) and Θ_{2}(=R_{2}/R), with R_{1}=ε^{3}r_{1} and R_{2}=ε^{3}r_{2}. Hereafter, we take into account the conditions ξ_{t=0}=εr_{2}−r_{1}, η_{t=0}=εr_{1}−r_{2}, ξ_{t}=εr_{2}−r_{1}−2λt, and η_{t}=εr_{1}−r_{2}+2λt. Consequently, the leading phase functions P^{(0)}(η,R) and Q^{(0)}(ξ,R) due to the interaction of two pulses can be written as follows:
The corresponding phase shifts ΔP and ΔQ can be obtained if we assume that the observation time t is much greater than the pulses interaction time Δ_{0}/2λ, where Δ_{0} is the initial separation between two pulses. The corresponding phase shifts ΔP and ΔQ are given by [38–40]
III. NUMERICAL ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION
In this section, a numerical investigation of the collision between planar and nonplanar solitary pulses was performed to evaluate the fundamental properties of nonlinear solitary pulses in GaAs semiconductors, for the appropriate parameters n_{0}=10^{16} to 10^{17} cm^{−3}, me*=0.047m_{e}g,mh*=0.4m_{e}g, and ϵ=12.8 [28,30,45]. Since A (B) is always positive (negative), the nonlinear solitary pulses will be only the dark soliton for the present model. Figure 1 investigates the effect of the concentrations of electrons and holes on the solitary pulse phase speed with and without the exchange-correlation potentials. It is observed that increasing the quantum semiconductor plasma number density decreases the phase speed. This behavior may be explained as follows: by increasing the concentrations of the electrons and the holes of a system, one would except a decrease in the nonlinearity of the system; hence, a pulse cannot carry more energy to become a short pulse. Furthermore, without the exchange-correlation terms, the pulse phase speed decreases. This means that, physically, the existence of the exchange-correlation potentials may allow the transfer of energy for increasing the propagation speed of solitary pulses [10]. For different geometrical configurations [i.e., ν = 0 and 1(2) for planar geometry and nonplanar cylindrical (spherical) geometry, respectively]; Figs. 2(a)–2(c) [Figs. 3(a)–3(c)] demonstrate the colliding process between two nonlinear dark pulses (contour plot) in planar, cylindrical and spherical geometries, respectively. As depicted in these figures, two nonlinear dark pulses propagate in opposite directions and approach each other; as time goes on, they meet, collide, and then asymptotically separate away. One can then observe that during the collisions, the dark pulses appear to be merged together to form a single composite structure. Consequently, one can also note that the trajectories of the dark pulses have deviated from the initial trajectories. Of course, this deviation leads to the delay time Δt, which represents the phase shift and increases with the increase of ν(as shown in Fig. 3). It should be mentioned here that the vertical lines in Fig. 3 illustrate the beginning and end times of the interaction that represent the delay time Δt when the nonlinear dark pulses appear merged together. For further illustration, besides Figs. 2 and 3, let us give the physical picture of the solitary pulses in cylindrical geometry, as depicted in Fig. 4. In Fig. 4, there are two dark solitary rings that propagate in opposite directions and interact with each other. Figure 5 explores the diversity in the phase shifts ΔP for planar and nonplanar geometries. It is clear that ΔP{ν=2sphericalgeometry}>ΔP{ν=1cylindiricalgeometry}>ΔP{ν=0planargeometry}. In addition, the phase shift ΔP decreases with the increase of the concentrations of electrons and holes. As shown in Figs. 2 and 3, the variety in the geometry plays an important role in the propagation and collision of nonlinear dark pulses. Physically, the phase shifts mean that loss of energy takes place by the collision of nonlinear dark pulses without changing the shape. Thus, the lost energy enhances for the nonplanar geometry more than planar geometry. Furthermore, the energy consumption increases with spherical geometry more than cylindrical geometry. Figure 5 is plotted to check the effect of the exchange-correlation terms on the collision of nonlinear dark pulses for varied geometry. It is obvious that the absence of the exchange-correlation terms leads to an increase in the phase shift ΔP, which may be attributed to the reduction in the propagation speed of the solitary pulse due to the deficiency of energy transfer. It is vitally important to compare the propagation and the dynamic behavior of dark pulses in different media of quantum semiconductor plasmas. To this end, the phase shifts are depicted in Fig. 6 for GaAs and GaN semiconductors for different values of space r. It is essential to note that an increase of r leads to a decrease of the phase shifts. Moreover, it is important to notice that the phase shifts of the GaN semiconductor are greater than those of the GaAs semiconductor. This indicates that the lost energy increases due to the interaction between nonlinear dark pulses in GaN more than in GaAs. In other words, the propagation of the nonlinear dark pulses is more stable in GaAs than in GaN. Furthermore, Fig. 6 shows that ΔP (i.e., the energy consumption) enhances with spherical geometry more than cylindrical geometry.
In summary, we studied the nonlinear propagation and the collision of pulses in GaAs semiconductors for different geometrical configurations. In the present model, a numerical investigation demonstrated that the generated pulses might exist only in dark pulses. Basically, we illustrated that the variety in the geometry has a significant effect on the nonlinear propagation and the collision of dark pulses. Thus, the energy consumption increases with the nonplanar geometry more than that of the planar geometry. Therefore, we can conclude that the sensitive response of the nonlinear dark pulses to the geometrical configurations and boundary conditions of a quantum semiconductor plasma indicates that the variation in the geometry plays a vital role in the essential fundamentals of the dark solitary pulses. Moreover, we believe that the present results may help in gaining a deep understanding of the dynamic behavior of nonlinear dark pulses that propagate in quantum semiconductor plasmas.
