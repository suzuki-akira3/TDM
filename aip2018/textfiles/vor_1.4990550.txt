Symmetry reduction of the three-body problem based on Euler angles
We consider the classical three-body problem with an arbitrary pair potential which depends on the inter-body distance. A general three-body configuration is set by three “radial” and three angular variables which determine the shape and orientation, respectively, of a triangle with the three bodies located at the vertices. The radial variables are given by the distances between a reference body and the other two, and by the angle at the reference body between the other two. Such radial variables set the potential energy of the system, and they are reminiscent of the inter-body distance in the two-body problem. On the other hand, the angular variables are the Euler angles relative to a rigid rotation of the triangle, and they are analogous to the polar and azimuthal angles of the vector between the two bodies in the two-body problem. We show that the rotational symmetry allows us to obtain a closed set of eight Hamilton equations of motion, whose generalized coordinates are the three radial variables and one additional angle, for which we provide the following geometrical interpretation. We consider the plane through a reference body, which is orthogonal to the line between the reference and the second body. We show that the angular variable above is the angle between the plane projection of the angular-momentum vector and the projection of the radius between the reference and the third body.
I. INTRODUCTION
The motion of three bodies under their mutual interaction arises in a variety of contexts in physics. The characterization and prediction of this motion, named the three-body problem, have played a fundamental role since the original work of Newton on the Sun-Earth-Moon system [1]. Such a prototypical case of the gravitational three-body problem attracted growing interest in the eighteenth and nineteenth century [2], both as a testing ground for the law of universal gravitation and for its fundamental technological applications. Indeed, the prediction of the relatively quick motion of the Moon on the background sky allowed for reckoning Greenwich mean time from the observed Moon’s position with the method of lunar distance, and thus for determining the longitude of the observer [3–5].
Given that an explicit solution proved to be out of reach, multiple studies focused on how to simplify the problem by reducing its number of degrees of freedom, in an effort to obtain reliable computations of the ephemerides [6,7]. In what follows, we will review some of these reductions in chronological order.
Among the most significant symmetry reductions of the problem is the one proposed by Lagrange [8]. By algebraically manipulating Newton’s equations of motion, Lagrange obtained a closed set of four second-order and three first-order differential equations for seven dynamical variables, and the existence of four independent integrals allowed for reducing these equations to a smaller set equivalent to seven first-order equations. Later on, Jacobi presented a reduction to a set of differential equations of equivalent complexity: The problem was first reduced to a set of equations describing the movement of two bodies, which were further simplified by means of the elimination of their orbital nodes [9].
Further studies performed the reduction to a system of equations in the Hamiltonian form: Radau derived a system of equations for the distances of two bodies from the third, their angular distances from the line of nodes, and the respective conjugate momenta, which may be effectively reduced to seven first-order equations by using the conservation of the energy [10]. A reduction to a Hamiltonian system with the same number of degrees of freedom was performed by Poincaré in terms of Keplerian variables, in an effort to analyze the perturbative series of the reduced Hamiltonian [6]. A few years later, Bennett proposed an additional Hamiltonian reduction with four generalized coordinates given by a subset of the Cartesian coordinates of two bodies in a reference frame centered in the third [11]. A further symmetry reduction was proposed by Van Kampen and Wintner, who derived a set of Hamilton equations for four degrees of freedom, the inter-body distances and an angular variable symmetrical with respect to permutations of the bodies, by leveraging a set of invariant relations for canonical coordinates [12]. An additional symmetry reduction suited to perturbative approaches has been proposed in a recent analysis [13]: Unlike other studies where the degrees of freedom are reduced by two units at once, this reduction is performed in two separate steps based on the conservation of the direction and norm of the angular-momentum vector. Although the first step allows for a reduction by one degree of freedom only, it presents some advantages, e.g., it preserves the rotational symmetry, which is broken in other approaches.
Finally, recent analyses used a combination of differential geometry and geometric-invariant theory to reduce the equations of motion, and obtained a set of nine first-order differential equations with two constants of motion, whose complexity is thus equivalent to the reduced equations above [14,15].
In this analysis, we consider the three-body problem with an arbitrary pair potential depending on the inter-body distance and propose a symmetry-reduction procedure based on Euler angles, inspired by an analogy with the two-body problem. A three-body configuration is described by a triangle, whose vertices correspond to the three bodies, and a general triangle conformation is described by three “radial” and three angular variables. First, the “radial” variables determine the triangle shape, and they are given by the length of two sides of the triangle and the angle between them—in the gravitational three-body problem, the latter angle corresponds to the astronomical elongation, i.e., the angle at one body between the other two [3]. Such radial variables set the potential energy of the system, and they are therefore reminiscent of the modulus of the vector between the two bodies in the two-body problem with a radial potential. Second, the triangle orientation is set by three angular variables—the Euler angles which describe a rigid rotation of the triangle, which are analogous to the polar and azimuthal angles of the vector above in the two-body problem.
By using the Hamiltonian formalism [6], we show that the rotational-symmetry differential conditions on the Hamiltonian identify directly a set of variables in terms of which we can write eight reduced Hamilton equations: These variables are given by the radial coordinates, one additional angular variable, and the respective conjugate momenta. Combined with the conservation of the total energy, our analysis provides a system of seven first-order equations, whose complexity is equivalent to that of the studies previously discussed. Finally, we study the geometric interpretation of the additional angular variable above: We consider the plane through a reference body, which is orthogonal to the line between the reference and the second body. We show that such a variable is the angle between the plane projection of the line between the reference and the third body and the plane projection of angular-momentum vector.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we revisit the two-body problem with the framework of Hamiltonian mechanics, and illustrate how rotational symmetry allows us to obtain two first-order equations of motion for the inter-body radius and its conjugate momentum. In Sec. III we show how to apply this analysis to the three-body problem. In Sec. III A we introduce a set of radial and angular variables that are reminiscent of those in the two-body example and derive the corresponding Hamilton formalism, whose rotational symmetry is analyzed in Sec. III B. In Sec. III C, we derive the resulting reduced equations of motion and Hamiltonian, whose features and geometric interpretation are discussed in Sec. IV.
II. THE TWO-BODY PROBLEM REVISITED
In order to illustrate our symmetry-reduction procedure with an example, consider two bodies with masses m_{1}, m_{2} and coordinates X_{1}, X_{2} in an inertial reference frame, which interact through a potential U(X_{1}−X_{2}). Setting
the equation of motion for r reads
where ̇ denotes the time derivative,
is the reduced mass, and
Equation (2) is the Euler-Lagrange equation of the Lagrangian
We now write r in terms of radial and angular variables, setting
where r_{0} ≡ (0, 0, r), and the matrices
represent a rotation by θ about the z and x axes, respectively. In Eq. (6), we have denoted the polar and azimuthal angles by β and γ, respectively, in order to draw an analogy with the three-body problem in Sec. III. We adopt q ≡ (r, β, γ) as generalized coordinates, in terms of which we re-write the Lagrangian formulation above. The resulting Hamiltonian
depends on the angular variables β, p_{β}, and p_{γ} through the square modulus of the angular momentum ℓ^{2}=pβ2+csc^{2}βpγ2, where ℓ≡r×μṙ=(cos⁡γp_{β}−cotβ⁡sin⁡γp_{γ},sin⁡γp_{β}+cotβ⁡cos⁡γp_{γ},p_{γ}). Given that ℓ^{2} is a constant of motion, the Hamilton equations for r and p_{r} are decoupled from the equations for the angular variables, and the problem is thus reduced to a single degree of freedom.
The observation above that H depends on the angular variables and conjugate momenta through ℓ^{2} can be easily made by direct inspection of Eq. (9). However, for systems with a more complex Hamiltonian structure such as the three-body problem, the identification of the dependence of H on its angular variables by direct inspection is not straightforward, cf. Sec. III. For this reason, we will show that such dependence can be worked out with an alternative procedure, i.e., by leveraging the rotational invariance of H [6]: in what follows, we will detail this procedure for the two-body problem as an illustrative example. The rotational invariance of H implies [16]
where
is the Poisson bracket, and the summation runs over the generalized coordinates and conjugate momenta p ≡ (p_{r}, p_{β}, p_{γ}). Equation (10) implies the existence of three constants of motion—the three components of the angular momentum ℓ. Given that these constants are not in involution with each other, the condition (10) does not allow us to lower by three the number of degrees of freedom of the system [6]. However, it is possible to find two combinations of the angular-momentum components, e.g., ℓ_{z} and ℓ^{2}, which are both constants of motion and in involution with each other
The differential conditions (12) and (13) will allow us to reduce the number of degrees of freedom of the problem by two units: The condition (12) implies
On the other hand, Eq. (13) yields the following partial differential equation
which can be solved directly, yielding
Equation (16) reproduces the result (9), i.e., the Hamiltonian depends on β and p_{β} through the constant of motion ℓ^{2}, which allows us to write an equation of motion for a single degree of freedom as discussed above.
III. THREE-BODY PROBLEM
In this section, we will perform the symmetry reduction of the three-body problem, proceeding along the lines of the illustrative example above.
A. Hamiltonian formalism for radial variables and Euler angles
Consider three bodies with masses m_{1}, m_{2}, m_{3} and coordinates X_{1}, X_{2}, X_{3} in an inertial reference frame, where bodies i and j interact through a pair potential U_{ij}(X_{i}−X_{j}). The equations of motion read
for i = 1, 2, 3, and U_{ij}(r) = U_{ji}(r) is an arbitrary pair potential between bodies i and j, which depends on their positions through the inter-body distance X_{i}−X_{j}. We now introduce a new set of variables r and s, where r is given by Eq. (1), and
In the gravitational three-body problem for the Earth-Moon-Sun system, the variables r and s coincide with the heliocentric Cartesian coordinates, where bodies 1, 2, and 3 are the Earth, Sun, and Moon, respectively [17,18].
We consider Eq. (17) for i = 2 and multiply it by m_{1}, consider Eq. (17) for i = 1 and multiply it by m_{2}, subtract the two equations, and proceed along the same lines for i = 2 and 3. We obtain the following equations of motion for r and s:
where M ≡ m_{1} + m_{2} + m_{3} is the total mass and the reduced masses μ and ν are respectively defined by Eq. (3) and by
r is given by Eq. (4), and s≡s.
Equations (19) can be regarded as the equations of motion of two interacting bodies with coordinates r and s and masses μ and ν, respectively. In order to carry out their symmetry reduction, we will study Eq. (19) with the Lagrangian formalism. In this regard, we set
and consider the Lagrangian
which, in the gravitational three-body problem, is known to yield the Hamiltonian and canonical equations of motion in heliocentric coordinates [17]. From the expression (22), it is straightforward to show that the Euler-Lagrange equations of L imply Eqs. (19): as a result, we may take L as the Lagrangian of the two-body system.
We will now leverage the rotational symmetry of the problem by making the change of coordinates depicted in Fig. 1. Given r_{0} ≡ (0, 0, r) and s_{0} ≡ s(sin ϑ, 0, cos ϑ), we write a general configuration of r and s as a rigid rotation of the triangle formed by r_{0} and s_{0}
where R_{z}(θ) and R_{x}(θ) represent a rotation by θ about the z and x axes, and they are given by Eqs. (7) and (8), respectively.
Equations (23) and (24) allow us to write the six variables r and s in terms of r, s, ϑ, α, β, and γ. The variables r, s, and ϑ determine the shape of the triangle formed by r and s, whose vertices coincide with the three bodies. On the other hand, the Euler angles α, β, and γ characterize a rigid rotation of the triangle [16] and thus set the triangle’s orientation. An analogous set of variables occurs in the symmetry reduction of the two-body problem above, where the potential depends on the modulus of the radius r only, not on the angular variables β and γ which determine the direction of r. Along the same lines, the rotational symmetry for the three-body problem implies that the potential V(r,s,r−s)=V(r,s,r^{2}+s^{2}−2rs⁡cos⁡𝜗) is a function of the variables r, s, and ϑ only, which will thus be denoted by “radial” variables, as opposed to the angular variables α, β, and γ.
We set q = (r, s, ϑ, α, β, γ) and rewrite the Lagrangian L as a function of q and q̇. By deriving both sides of Eqs. (23) and (24) with respect to t, we obtain ṙ and ṡ as functions of q and q̇
and substitute Eq. (25) in Eq. (22). We then construct the Hamiltonian formalism for L by introducing the conjugate momenta
and obtain
which is the Hamiltonian for the radial coordinates, the Euler angles, and the respective conjugate momenta.
Finally, we observe that Eqs. (26) and (27) may alternatively be obtained by considering the generalized coordinates Q = (r, s), constructing their conjugate momenta P=(∂L∂ṙ,∂L∂ṡ) and Hamiltonian, and introducing a canonical transformation (Q, P) → (q, p) with the generating function of the second type F=F_{2}(Q,p)−∑_{i}q_{i}p_{i} [16], where F_{2}(Q,p)=∑_{i}f_{i}(Q)P_{i} and q = f(Q) is the transformation described by Eqs. (23) and (24).
B. Rotational-symmetry conditions
Proceeding along the lines of Sec. II, the rotational symmetry of the Hamiltonian (27) will be written in terms of Poisson brackets and angular momentum.
Denoting the coordinate of the center of mass (CM) by X_{CM} ≡ (m_{1}X_{1} + m_{2}X_{2} + m_{3}X_{3})/M and the body coordinates in the CM reference frame by
we express the three variables x_{i} in terms of r and s by means of Eqs. (1), (18), (28) and the condition m_{1}x_{1} + m_{2}x_{2} + m_{3}x_{3} = 0. We obtain
As a result, the angular momentum in the CM reference frame can be written as
where in the second line we used Eqs. (29) and in the third line we expressed ṙ, ṡ as functions of the conjugate momenta by using Eqs. (23)–(26). The rotational symmetry of the Lagrangian (22) implies the differential condition (10), where the Poisson bracket is given by Eq. (11), and the summation in Eq. (11) runs over the generalized coordinates r, s, ϑ, α, β, γ and their conjugate momenta.
Proceeding along the lines of Sec. II, we consider the quantities ℓ_{z} and ℓ^{2} which are both in involution and constants of motion, cf. Eqs. (12) and (13). While the condition (12) implies that the Hamiltonian is independent of γ, i.e., Eq. (14), Eq. (13) results in a more involved partial differential equation for H. In order to write explicitly this equation, we express ℓ^{2} in terms of the conjugate momenta by using Eq. (30)
we substitute Eq. (31) in Eq. (13) and obtain
We solve the linear first-order partial differential equation (34) in the variables α, β, and p_{β} with the method of characteristics [19]. The characteristic curves α(λ), β(λ), and p_{β}(λ) are defined in terms of the parameter λ, and they satisfy
In order to solve the system of ordinary differential equations above, we eliminate the parameter λ by combining Eqs. (34) and (35)
where the characteristic curves are now parametrized in terms of β rate than in terms of λ. By integrating Eq. (36), we obtain
where ς = ±1 denotes the sign of p_{β} throughout the rest of our analysis, and C_{1} is an integration constant which will be determined in what follows. In order to determine β(λ), we substitute Eq. (37) in Eq. (34) and obtain
By restricting our analysis to the values of λ, for which p_{β}(λ) does not change sign, Eq. (38) implies
which can be solved for β(λ), yielding
where we have set
By substituting Eq. (40) in Eq. (37), we obtain p_{β}(λ)
Finally, α(λ) is obtained by substituting Eqs. (40) in Eq. (33)
The differential equations (34) imply that the Hamiltonian is constant across the characteristic curves [19], in particular
where we indicated the dependence of the Hamiltonian on the variables α, β, and p_{β} only to simplify the notation. To obtain the explicit dependence of the left-hand side of Eq. (44) on α(λ), β(λ), and p_{β}(λ), we express α(C_{2}), β(C_{2}), and p_{β}(C_{2}) in the right-hand side (RHS) as functions of α(λ), β(λ), and p_{β}(λ) by using the solution above for the characteristic curves. To achieve this, we combine Eqs. (40) and (42) and solve them for sin(σ(λ)) and C_{1}, which are thus expressed as functions of β(λ) and p_{β}(λ). Setting
the solution for C_{1} and sin(σ(λ)) reads
where Eqs. (31), (45), and (46) show that the integration constant C_{1} coincides with the square modulus of the angular momentum on the characteristic curve. Combining Eqs. (40) and (42) for λ = C_{2} with Eq. (46), we obtain that β(C_{2}) and p_{β}(C_{2}) depend on α(λ), β(λ), and p_{β}(λ) through the combination Φ(β(λ), p_{β}(λ), p_{α}, p_{γ}).
Finally, we carry out the same analysis for α(C_{2}): we consider Eq. (43) for λ = C_{2} and obtain
The first term on the RHS of Eq. (48) depends on β(λ) and p_{β}(λ) through the combination Φ. As far as the second term C_{3} is concerned, we substitute Eq. (46) in Eq. (43) and express all trigonometric functions in terms of sin(σ(λ)), which we rewrite according to Eq. (47). As a result, Eq. (43) allows us to write C_{3} as a function of α(λ), β(λ), and p_{β}(λ). Both terms in the RHS of Eq. (48) are thus expressed in terms of α(λ), β(λ), and p_{β}(λ), and after a few algebraic manipulations we obtain
where
By combining Eq. (44) with Eqs. (40) and (42) evaluated at λ = C_{2} and with Eq. (49) we obtain
By writing explicitly the dependence on p_{α} and p_{γ}, Eq. (51) yields
where in the third line we rewrote the overall variable dependence of the second line in terms of a function H of Φ(β, p_{β}, p_{α}, p_{γ}), Ψ(α, β, p_{β}, p_{α}, p_{γ}), p_{α}, and p_{γ}.
Equation (52) constitutes the solution of the partial differential equation (32), and it is the analog of Eq. (16) for the two-body problem. Although in both the two- and three-body problem H is a function of the total angular momentum, Eq. (52) shows that in the three-body problem H depends on an additional angular variable Ψ, whose interpretation will be discussed below.
C. Reduced equations of motion
The differential conditions (14) and (52) will allow us to reduce the number of degrees of freedom by two units, i.e., to write a closed set of equations of motion, which involve only four variables as opposed to the six degrees of freedom of the Lagrangian (22).
To achieve this, we will follow the general procedure discussed in Ref [6]. We invert Eqs. (45) and (50); i.e., we express β and p_{β} as functions of Φ, Ψ, α, p_{α}, and p_{γ}: we introduce the functions β(φ, ψ, α, p_{α}, p_{γ}) and p_{β}(φ, ψ, α, p_{α}, p_{γ}), defined by
where φ and ψ are two independent variables and, given that Eqs. (45) and (50) may have multiple solutions for β and p_{β}, Eq. (53) should be regarded as a local inversion.
The equation of motion for Ψ reads
where in the first line we used Hamilton equations of motion and Eq. (14) and in the second line we used Eqs. (32) and (50). We rewrite the terms in brackets in the last line of Eq. (54) as functions of the derivatives of H by proceeding as follows: We derive Eqs. (53) with respect to p_{α}, set
and obtain
which we solve for ∂β/∂p_{α} and ∂p_{β}/∂p_{α}. By using Eqs. (45) and (50), we observe that
solve Eq. (56). Combined with Eq. (54), Eq. (57) implies
We will now write the RHS of Eq. (58) in terms of the reduced Hamiltonian H. To achieve this, we use the definition (53) and rewrite Eq. (52) as
By deriving Eq. (59) with respect to p_{α} and fixing φ and ψ according to Eqs. (55), we reconstruct the RHS of Eq. (58)
Equation (60) is the equation of motion for Ψ, and it has the form of a Hamilton equation of motion with Hamiltonian H, where p_{α} is the conjugate momentum of Ψ.
Proceeding along the same lines, we work out the equation of motion for p_{α}: We have
and express the RHS of Eq. (61) as a function of H. We derive both sides of Eq. (59) with respect to ψ, set φ and ψ according to Eqs. (55), and obtain
Proceeding along the lines of Eq. (56), we work out ∂β/∂Ψ and ∂p_{β}/∂Ψ in Eq. (62): We derive Eqs. (53) with respect to ψ, impose Eqs. (55), solve the resulting linear system
and obtain
By substituting Eq. (64) in Eq. (62), we reconstruct the derivative of H with respect to α
where in the second line we used Eq. (32). By substituting Eq. (65) in Eq. (61), we obtain the equation of motion for p_{α}
Put together, Eqs. (60) and (66) have the form of the Hamilton equations for two the generalized coordinate Ψ and its conjugate momentum p_{α}.
The equations of motion for the remaining variables r, s, and ϑ and their conjugate momenta can be written directly in terms of H by combining Hamilton equations of motion with Eq. (52)
with q = r, s, ϑ and p = p_{r}, p_{s}, p_{ϑ}, respectively.
Finally, we work out the expression for the reduced Hamiltonian H. Because both sides of Eq. (59) are independent of α, H can be obtained from H by setting α to an arbitrary value in Eq. (59). We choose α = ψ, given that for this value of α the expression (50) simplifies; thus, the inverse functions β and p_{β} in Eq. (53) can be worked out easily
We substitute Eq. (68) in Eq. (59), set φ = Φ and ψ = Ψ, and obtain the reduced Hamiltonian
To summarize, the reduced equations of motion can be written explicitly by combining Eqs. (60), (66), and (67), and they read
where the reduced Hamiltonian is given by Eq. (69) and ς = ±1 for p_{β} ≷ 0, respectively. Equations (69) and (70) constitute the main result of this paper.
While Eqs. (70) determine the time dependence of the radial variables r, s, and ϑ and their conjugate momenta, the remaining angular variables α, β, and γ can be determined from an additional set of differential and algebraic equations—see the Appendix for details. Indeed, the RHSs of Hamilton equations of motion of α and γ
can be written as follows:
where
and
Overall, Eqs. (71)–(73) constitute a closed set of differential equations which depend on the reduced variables r, s, ϑ, and Ψ, their conjugate momenta, the constants of motion Φ and p_{γ}, and the Euler angle α. Once the reduced variables and conjugate momenta are obtained from Eq. (70), Eqs. (71)–(73) determine the time dependence of α and γ, while the remaining Euler angle β is obtained from the algebraic relation
IV. DISCUSSION
The reduced equations of motion (70) constitute a set of eight Hamilton equations for the generalized coordinates r, s, ϑ, and Ψ and their conjugate momenta p_{r}, p_{s}, p_{ϑ}, and p_{α}, with Hamiltonian H. Together with the conservation of the energy, Ḣ=0, these equations of motion can be reduced to a system of seven first-order equations, whose complexity is thus tantamount to that of the reductions discussed in Sec. I.
In what follows, we will discuss some physical and geometrical features of the reduced system (70). First, in the limit where the mass and pair interactions of one of the three bodies vanish, H reproduces the Hamiltonian of the two-body problem discussed in Sec. II. Indeed, it can be shown that, for m_{3} → 0, the conjugate momenta p_{s}, p_{ϑ}, and p_{α} defined by Eq. (26) are ∼m_{3}, and thus Eq. (69) reproduces the two-body-problem Hamiltonian (9) with U = U_{12}.
An additional feature of the reduced Hamiltonian H is that it depends on the sign of p_{β}, cf. Eq. (69). Given a set of initial conditions for r, s, ϑ, and Ψ and their conjugate momenta, the appropriate sign ς in H is chosen according to the sign of p_{β} at the initial time. The reduced equations of motion can then be integrated forward in time, keeping the same H as long as p_{β} does not change sign. Given that H must be a continuous function of time, a change of sign in p_{β} must correspond to the vanishing of Φ−pα2: Indeed, if this were not the case, the second line in Eq. (52) would imply that H has a discontinuous jump at the instant of time where p_{β} vanishes. Because the time evolution of p_{α} is determined by the reduced equations of motion (70), such equations allow us to determine the instant of time where Φ−pα2, and thus p_{β} vanishes, and to extend the integration beyond that time by reversing the sign ς in H. The sign τ in Eqs. (72), (73), and (76) may be determined proceeding along the same lines.
Finally, we will discuss the physical and geometric interpretation of the angular variables ϑ and Ψ that appear in the reduced equations. A natural physical interpretation for ϑ is obtained by applying our analysis to the Sun-Earth-Moon system [2] and denoting by body 1 the Sun, 2 the Earth, and 3 the Moon. In this case, the angle ϑ becomes the lunar elongation from the Sun, which determines the percentage of the Moon surface that is illuminated as seen from the Earth and sets the Moon phases [3]. Given that our reduced equations contain both the Earth-Moon distance s and the lunar elongation ϑ, they constitute a minimal reduced system which predicts the size and shape of the illuminated lunar surface as seen from the Earth.
As far as the variable Ψ is concerned, its geometric interpretation will be clarified in what follows—see Fig. 2. We apply the rotation R_{z}(γ)R_{x}(β) to the axes x, y, and z of the reference frame in Fig. 1 and obtain the axes x′, y′, and z′. First, the geometric construction in Fig. 1 implies that the angle α in Eq. (50) is the angle between x′ and the projection of s on the x′y′ plane. Second, we observe that the argument of arctan in Eq. (50) can be rewritten as
where ℓ_{x^{′}} and ℓ_{y^{′}} are the projections of ℓ on x′ and y′, respectively. It follows that arctan [(p_{γ} − cos βp_{α})/(sin βp_{β})] is the angle between x′ and the projection of ℓ on the x′y′ plane, modulo π. As a result, Ψ is given by the angle between the projection of s and the projection of ℓ on the x′y′ plane, modulo π.
APPENDIX: EQUATIONS FOR THE EULER ANGLES
In what follows, we will derive Eqs. (72) and (73) and the algebraic relation (76).
To achieve this, we consider the Hamilton equations of motion (71) and express their RHSs as functions of H. By deriving Eq. (59) with respect to φ, ψ, p_{α}, and p_{γ} and setting φ and ψ according to Eqs. (55), we obtain
In Eqs. (A1), the derivatives of β and p_{β} with respect to Φ, Ψ, p_{α}, and p_{γ} may be determined proceeding along the same lines as in Sec. III C. First, the derivatives with respect to p_{α} and Ψ are given by Eqs. (57) and (64), respectively. Second, the derivatives with respect to Φ are obtained by deriving Eqs. (53) with respect to φ, imposing Eqs. (55), and solving the resulting linear system of equations for ∂β∂Φ and ∂p_{β}∂Φ. The result is
Proceeding along the same lines, we derive Eqs. (53) with respect to p_{γ}, impose Eqs. (55), solve the resulting linear systems for ∂β∂p_{γ} and ∂p_{β}∂p_{γ}, and obtain
Finally, we use Eqs. (57), (64), (A2), and (A3) in Eqs. (A1), solve Eq. (A1) for ∂H∂β, ∂H∂p_{β}, ∂H∂p_{α} and ∂H∂p_{γ}, and obtain
The RHSs of Eqs. (A4) and (A5) depend only on the reduced variables r, s, ϑ, and Ψ and their conjugate momenta, on the constants of motion Φ and p_{γ}, and on β, p_{β}. In what follows, we will write β and p_{β} in terms of Φ, Ψ, p_{α}, p_{γ} and α and thus express (A4) and (A5) in terms of the reduced variables, their conjugate momenta, the constants of motion and α only. To achieve this, we solve Eq. (50) for cos β and obtain
where τ is given by Eq. (74). We substitute Eq. (A6) in Eq. (45) and obtain Φ=pα2+pβ2/cos^{2}(α−Ψ), which yields
We substitute Eq. (A7) in (A6) and obtain (76), where Λ is given by Eq. (75). Finally, we substitute Eqs. (A7) and (76) in Eqs. (A4) and (A5) and obtain Eqs. (72) and (73).

Given the r and s vectors in Fig. 1 (red and blue, respectively), the axes x′, y′, and z′ (gray) are obtained by applying a rotation by β about the x axis and a rotation by γ about the z axis to x, y, and z, respectively. We show the angle α (dashed green curve) between the projection of s on the x′y′ plane (gray circle) and x′. The projection of the angular-momentum vector ℓ (brown) on the x′y′ plane forms an angle arctan [(p_{γ} − cos βp_{α})/(sin βp_{β})] with x′ (dashed yellow curve), and Ψ (solid light-blue curve) is the difference between the two angles above.
