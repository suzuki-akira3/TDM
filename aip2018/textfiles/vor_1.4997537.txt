Quantum and FLR effects on the Rayleigh Taylor instability of stratified plasmas
The combined effects of quantum corrections and finite Larmor radius (FLR) have been investigated on the linear hydrodynamic Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability of an incompressible stratified plasma. The basic quantum magnetohydrodynamic equations incorporating quantum and FLR effects are constructed and linearized under the small amplitude approximation. The general dispersion relation is derived considering appropriate magnetic field and density profiles using the normal mode analysis. It is analyzed numerically to study the effects of quantum and FLR corrections on the growth rate of RT instability in the stratified hydrodynamic fluids. It is found that the cut-off wavenumber (k_{max}) and critical wavenumber (k_{c}) determining the growth rate of RT instability are modified due to the presence of FLR corrections and quantum effects. The FLR and quantum corrections have a stabilizing effect on the growth rate of RT instability of a stratified plasma.
I. INTRODUCTION
The Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability is a hydrodynamic instability that arises at the interface of fluids of variable densities whenever the heavier fluid is supported by the lighter fluid in the presence of a vertical gravitational field [1]. It has a significance in the laser plasma interaction, Z pinch implosion, and various space and astrophysical phenomena like supernova implosion, explosion, white dwarfs, crab nebula, and type Ia supernovae [2–4]. The RT instability is extensively studied in different types of plasma medium such as dusty plasma, quantum plasma, and in strongly coupled plasmas. The growth rate of RT instability plays a vital role in the inertial confinement fusion (ICF), in the compression of the target materials [5]. Many of the theoretical and experimental studies have been carried out to investigate the RT instability in ICF. In the past few years, a large number of researchers have carried out a comprehensive study on the classical RT instability with various physical assumptions of hydrodynamics and hydromagnetics. Goldston and Rutherford [6] have studied the RT instability of continuous varying fluids. Also, the effects of magnetic field, rotation, surface tension, viscosity, porosity, and suspended dust particles have been explored extensively in our study of RT instability of two superposed incompressible fluids with their laboratory and astrophysical applications [1,7,8].
Moreover, the finite Larmor radius (FLR) correction has been discussed by various authors in many astrophysical situations in terms of gyro-viscous force. Rosenbluth et_al [9], Jukes [10], and Stasiewicz [11] have reported a stabilizing influence of FLR corrections on the hydromagnetic instabilities. Sanghvi and Chhajlani [12] investigated the effect of FLR correction on the RT instability of dusty magnetized and stratified plasma. Sharma and Chhajlani [13,14] have examined the FLR correction along with the rotation effect and suspended particles as well as neutral particles on the RT instability of two superposed fluids. El-Sayed [15] studied the effect of FLR correction and suspended particles on the RT instability of two highly viscous fluids.
Recently, the quantum plasma has drawn a lot of attention of authors due to its importance in various fields such as semiconductor devices, ultra electronic devices, and also in dense astrophysical system such as white dwarfs, laser Fusion plasmas, and in ICF [16–18]. The quantum plasma consists of degenerate charged particles and exhibits typical behavior at low temperature. The quantum effect arises whenever the de Broglie wavelength of charged particles is equal to or greater than the characteristic length of the system [19]. In this direction, Karmakar and Goutam [20] have investigated the electrostatic streaming instability modes in a complex viscoelastic quantum plasma. However, in order to describe the collective behavior of quantum plasma, various models have been investigated such as Schrodinger-Poisson model, Wigner-Poisson model, and quantum hydrodynamic model. The quantum hydrodynamic model derived by Hass [21] is used to describe the transport of charged particles in the dense quantum plasma.
The suppression of linear hydrodynamic RT instability due to various physical parameters has been studied recently by many researchers. The internal wave and linear RT instability in the incompressible stratified quantum plasma have been analyzed by Bychkov et_al [22] and suggested that quantum corrections at low temperature have a stabilizing influence on the growth rate of RT instability. Lu and Qiu [23] have extended the problem of Ref [22], considering compressibility effect in the quantum plasma and observed that the compressibility effect further enhances the stabilization. In the work of Wang et_al [24], it is reported that the suppression of RT instability due to the combined effects of magnetic field and quantum corrections plays a central role in the systems having large Atwood number. However, the stabilization disappears completely for short wavelength perturbations in the ferromagnetic limit [25]. In addition to this, the combined influence of magnetic field and diffusivity is studied on the growth rate of RT instability in a diffusive quantum plasma by Momeni [26]. In the study of strongly coupled plasma, Das and Kaw [27] found that a strong coupling effect suppresses the growth rate of RT instability, and the results are significantly applied in the ICF targets. In a very recent work, Dolai and Prajapati [28] have investigated that quantum corrections and strong coupling effects both have stabilizing influences on the growth rate of RT instability, and the results are applicable in the study of dense white dwarfs. The suppression of RT instability due to quantum effects is studied by Cao et_al [29] In the series of related works, Hoshoudy [30–33] has discussed the combined effects of horizontal and vertical magnetic field, porosity, and permeability on the RT instability in the quantum plasma. Tiwari et_al [34] have reported the effect of magnetic field on the RT instability of quantum plasma in a porous medium. Hoshoudy and Prajapati [35] have also studied the effect of suspended particle on the RT instability of stratified quantum plasma. Khare and Sen [36] have investigated the significance of RT instability in dusty plasma experiments. The study of RT instability of magnetized rotating strongly coupled viscoelastic fluid has also been carried out by Prajapati [37].
From the above studies (see Refs [22–36]), we find that the problems of linear hydrodynamic RT instability have been investigated in fluid plasma, quantum plasma, dusty plasma, and strongly coupled plasma, considering various stabilizing factors. So far, none of the authors have studied the combined effects of quantum corrections, magnetic field, and FLR corrections on the growth rate of RT instability in a stratified plasma. Therefore, viewing the astrophysical importance, we have studied the combined influence of quantum corrections and FLR corrections on the RT instability of stratified plasma in the present problem.
II. MATHEMATICAL MODEL
We consider a finite thickness of an incompressible plasma confined between two rigid planes z = 0 and z = h. The plasma is embedded in a uniform magnetic field H (H, 0, 0), and the gravitational field g (0, 0,−g) is acting vertically downward. Therefore, the relevant quantum hydrodynamic equations of the problem becomes as
Here, the symbols ρ, U, p, and μ_{e} stand for fluid density, fluid velocity, pressure, and permeability of medium, respectively. The quantum Bohm potential is expressed by
To examine the stability of system, we assume perturbation in each physical quantities as p = p_{0}+p_{1}, ρ = ρ_{0}+ρ_{1}, H = H_{0} + H_{1}, U = U_{0}+U_{1}, Q = Q_{0}+Q_{1}, where the symbols p_{0}, ρ_{0}, H_{0},U_{0}, and Q_{0} represent the equilibrium state of pressure, fluid density, magnetic field, velocity of fluid, and Bohm quantum force, respectively. p_{1}, ρ_{1}, H_{1} (h_{x}, h_{y}, h_{z}), U_{1}(u,v,w), and Q_{1}(Q_{1x}, Q_{1y} Q_{1z}) denote the perturbed state of pressure, fluid density, magnetic field, velocity of fluid, and quantum force, respectively. Thus, the linearized form of Eqs. (1)–(4) is obtained as
where Q_{1} is given as
The components of stress tensor P¯{1} in the presence of horizontal magnetic field H_{0}(H, 0, 0) are given by
The physical quantities of system take perturbations in the following form:
where “in” is the growth rate and “k” is the wavenumber of perturbation. We obtain Eqs. (6)–(10) in the component form by using Eq. (12) as follows:
where Q¯{1}{y},Q¯{1}{z} are given as
Now p_{1} and ρ_{1} can be eliminated from Eq. (14) with the help of Eqs. (13) and (15)–(17); as a consequence, the general differential equation in the terms of z component of velocity (w) is obtained as
where the substitutions A, B, and C are given by
III. STABILITY ANALYSIS OF STRATIFIED QUANTUM PLASMA
Let us consider that the density of fluid has an exponential dependence on z and varies with a length scale L_{D}. Therefore, the density distribution at z = 0 is given by
Now, on solving Eq. (20) by using Eq. (24), it becomes
where ωq2=ℏ^{2}4m_{e}m_{i}LD2 describes the effect of quantum corrections. The velocity of fluid vanishes at z = 0 and z = h; therefore, the solution of Eq. (25) is obtained as follows:
Here, λ=(−1/2L_{D}) and n′ is an integer. Using Eq. (26) and “σ= in,” in Eq. (25), we obtain
Equation (27) represents the dispersion relation of the RT instability in a stratified quantum plasma in the presence of FLR corrections. The presence of FLR term modifies the stability/instability of the RT configuration. It is coupled with the quantum corrections; hence, the combined effects of FLR corrections and quantum corrections will also modify the condition of RT instability as well as the growth rate of RT instability. The above dispersion relation is also reducible into the previous results. In the absence of FLR corrections, Eq. (27) reduces to Cao et_al [29] Under limiting cases, this dispersion relation in the absence of magnetic field is identical to the dispersion relations of Refs [30] and  [33]. Thus, the presence of FLR corrections modifies the dispersion relation of RT instability of previous studies. In the present configuration, the effect of magnetic field also disappears from the dispersion relation. This dispersion relation is further discussed in detail for various limiting cases in the section below.
IV. DISCUSSIONS OF DISPERSION RELATION
A. Absence of quantum effect and FLR correction
If we consider ω_{q}^{2} = 0, v_{0} = 0, then the general dispersion relation (27) becomes
It represents a dispersion relation for the classical RT instability in an unmagnetized plasma. Goldston and Rutherford [6] have discussed the classical RT instability and obtained the growth rate of classical RT instability as
Equation (29) represents the exponentially growing RT instability in a stratified plasma [6]. On comparing Eqs. (27) and (28), we find that the general dispersion relation (27) is similar to the dispersion relation of classical RT instability in the absence of FLR correction and quantum effect.
B. Absence of FLR corrections
If we neglect the effect of FLR correction (ν_{0}= 0) in the dispersion relation (27), then the dispersion relation becomes as
Equation (30) represents a dispersion relation for the RT instability in the presence of quantum effect. The dispersion relation (30) is similar to the dispersion relation obtained by Cao et_al [29] excluding the effect of magnetic field in that case. This reduced result is also identical to the dispersion relation as obtained by Hoshoudy [33] neglecting the effect of viscoelasticity and porosity in that case. The growth rate is obtained in the presence of quantum effect as
From Eqs. (29) and (31), it is clear that σ_{quantum}<σ_{classical}, and thus, the quantum effect has a stabilizing influence on the RT instability of a stratified plasma.
C. Absence of quantum corrections
Now neglecting the quantum effect from dispersion relation (27), it becomes
Equation (32) is similar to the dispersion relation (19) as discussed by Sanghvi and Chhajlani [12] in the absence of suspended dust particles. The above equation represents the effect of FLR correction on the RT instability of stratified fluids. In this case, the growth rate of RT instability becomes
From the above equation, we obtain the condition of stability as follows:
In this case, the roots will be purely imaginary, which implies that the system will be stable in the presence of FLR correction
The condition (35) implies that the system may have at least one complex root with positive real part, which leads to the instability of the system in the presence of FLR correction.
D. Combined effects of quantum and FLR corrections
The dispersion relation (27) represents the combined influence of quantum effect and FLR correction on the RT instability of stratified fluids. On comparing dispersion relation (27) with Eqs. (28), (30), and (32), we find that the dispersion relation (27) and the growth rate of RT instability get modified due to the presence of quantum effect and FLR corrections. In this case, the roots are given by
In this case, we find that the conditions of stability of the system are given by
From Eqs. (34) and (37), we find that the condition of stability is modified due to the presence of FLR correction and quantum effect.
For further analysis, we normalize the dispersion relation (27) by using the following substitution:
where ωpe2=ρe^{2}me2ε_{0} is the square of plasma frequency.
Now, we evaluate the behavior of growth rate with respect to the quantum effect, FLR correction and wavenumber mathematically. Equation (38) gives
From Eqs. (39) and (40), we find that dσ*/dω_{q}^{*} and dσ^{*}/dν_{0}^{*} are negative. This represents that the growth rate will decrease on increasing the value of quantum term (ω_{q}^{*}) and FLR correction (ν_{0}^{*}). We have also observed the behavior of growth rate with respect to wavenumber to find that dσ^{*}/dk^{*} may be positive. Thus, the growth rate increases as wavenumber k increases and attains a maximum position. The wavenumber where the growth rate acquires maximum value is known as cut-off wavenumber (k_{max}), and the wavenumber where the system turns out to be completely stable is known as critical wavenumber (k_{c}). When k >k_{max}, the growth rate decreases as the wave number increases and becomes completely stable at k_{c}. This behavior of growth rate is confirmed in Figs. 1–4.
In order to emphasize the behavior of growth rate, we have plotted graphically the growth rate (σ^{*}) versus wavenumber (k^{*}) with a variation in the FLR correction (ν_{0}^{*}) and quantum term (ω_{q}^{*}). In Figs. 1 and 2, the arbitrary values of parameters are taken as h^{*}= 1, n′ = 1, g* = 10, ν_{0}^{*}= 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, ω_{q}^{*}= 0 or 0.4 in classical and quantum cases. In both the figures, we have noticed that the growth rate decreases on increasing the value of the FLR correction, which implies that the FLR correction has a stabilizing influence in both the cases. However, we also note that the presence of quantum term reduces the values of cut-off wavenumber (k_{max}) and critical wavenumber (k_{c}) in contrast to the classical case; this indicates that the presence of the quantum effect brings out more stability on the RT instability of stratified plasma. Furthermore, Figs. 3 and 4 have been drawn to visualize the effect of quantum term on the growth rate of RT instability in the absence and presence of FLR correction. Assuming the values of parameters as h* = 1, n′ = 1, g* = 10, ν_{0}^{*}= 0 or 0.6, and ω_{q}^{*}= 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, it is found that the growth rate decreases on increasing the value of quantum term; it also reveals that the quantum term has a stabilizing effect on the growth rate of RT instability of stratified plasma in both cases. However, the values of cut-off wavenumber (k_{max}) and critical wavenumber (k_{c}) are reduced in the presence of FLR correction in contrast with the absence of FLR correction. In Figs. 2–4, we also find that the growth rate of Rayleigh Taylor instability in the presence of quantum effect is identical to the graphical analysis of Hoshoudy [33]; however, the cut-off wavenumber and critical wavenumber decrease due to the presence of FLR correction in the present case. Consequently, the FLR corrections have a stabilizing effect on the growth rate of RT instability of a stratified plasma.
V. CONCLUSION
In the present work, we have discussed the FLR correction and quantum effect on the RT instability of a stratified plasma. We have constructed the relevant quantum magnetohydrodynamic equations of the problem which are solved by using the normal mode analysis. A dispersion relation for the RT instability of stratified plasma is analytically derived, and it is examined in various cases. It is found that the classical RT instability is modified due to the presence of FLR correction and quantum effects. Furthermore, we have found that the cut-off wavenumber (k_{max}) and critical wavenumber (k_{c}) are affected due to the presence of FLR corrections and quantum effects. We also notice that the FLR corrections and quantum effect have a stabilizing influence on the RT instability of stratified plasma. Thus, we conclude that the presence of FLR corrections along with quantum effect brings more stability to the system of RT instability of a stratified plasma. Hence, the combined FLR and quantum effects are significant to analyze the problem of hydrodynamic RT instability of stratified plasma. The results of the present work are relevant in analyzing the RT stability problem in the white dwarfs and in ICF capsule. The importance of FLR correction in the RT instability in various astrophysical systems having high density, low temperature can be understood with the help of present results.
