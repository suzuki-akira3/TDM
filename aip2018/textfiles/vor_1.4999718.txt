Weakly strained highly mismatched B_{x}In_{1-x}B^{V}_{y}As_{1-y} (B^{V} = Sb, Bi) alloys
Thermodynamically favorable 4B10B^{V} (B^{V} = Sb, Bi) clustering, reducing the internal strain energy, is presented in highly mismatched InAs-rich B_{x}In_{1-x}B^{V}_{y}As_{1-y} alloys. The cluster formation decreases the sum of the internal energies of the constituent compounds and internal strain energy. The cohesive energies, enthalpies of formation, bond stretching, and bond bending elastic constants of zinc blende BBi and InBi are calculated. The clustering conditions are estimated up to 800 °C within the compositions 5 × 10^{−5} ≤ x ≤ 0.01 and x ≤ y ≤ 100x. The internal strain energies of B_{x}In_{1-x}Sb_{y}As_{1-y} and B_{x}In_{1-x}Bi_{y}As_{1-y} (y ≥ 2.5x) in which 99.99% boron atoms are in the clusters are more than three and seven times, respectively, less than in alloys without clusters. The formation conditions for such weakly strained highly mismatched alloys have been obtained. Almost all boron atoms should be in 4B10Sb and 4B10Bi clusters at 800 °C in B_{x}In_{1-x}Sb_{y}As_{1-y} with x ≥ 4.2 × 10^{−4} and y ≥ 10x and in B_{x}In_{1-x}Bi_{y}As_{1-y} with x ≥ 6.6 × 10^{−5} and y ≥ 10x.
I. INTRODUCTION
The heterostructures with InSb_{x}As_{1-x} and InBi_{x}As_{1-x} alloy epitaxial films are actively studied now as promising materials for electronic and photonic applications [1–4]. Alloying Sb or Bi with InAs allows us to obtain rather longer wavelengths corresponding to the mid-infrared spectral region. All such alloys are highly mismatched and, as a result, strongly internally strained. InSb_{x}As_{1-x} alloys were successfully grown via molecular beam epitaxy and metalorganic chemical vapor deposition over the wide composition range [1,2]. However, the undesirable surface segregation of highly mismatched Sb is present during the growth processes [2]. InBi_{x}As_{1-x} alloys were grown as InAs-rich alloys by molecular beam epitaxy [3,4]. A non-uniform composition in such films was detected in spite of the small Bi content [4]. This is obviously due to the greater difference in the atomic sizes. This difference causes significant internal strains that are an essential disadvantage of such alloys. Therefore, the search for ways to decrease these strains in highly mismatched alloys is an important problem.
A way to reduce the internal strains was proposed in Ref [5]. The internal strains caused by Sb atoms in GaAs can be significantly decreased by using the double doping with boron and Sb. The cause of reduction of the internal strains in GaAs:(B, Sb) is 4B10Sb and 1B4Sb cluster formation. The cluster formation is thermodynamically favorable in GaAs:(B, Sb) or GaAs-rich B_{x}Ga_{1-x}Sb_{y}As_{1-y} alloys over the wide content and temperature ranges. 4B10Sb clusters are boron tetrahedrons surrounded by Sb atoms. The occurrence of such clusters significantly decreases the internal strain energy since B-Sb and Ga-As bonds are larger and smaller than B-As and Ga-Sb ones, respectively. 1B4Sb clusters are Sb tetrahedrons with boron atoms in their centers. The 1B4Sb cluster formation also reduces the internal strain energy but less than that of the larger clusters. 4B10Sb clusters are more favorable since the angles between the bonds are deformed mainly in them. B_{x}In_{1-x}B^{V}_{y}As_{1-y} (B^{V} = Sb, Bi) alloys are similar to B_{x}Ga_{1-x}Sb_{y}As_{1-y}. Therefore, 4B10B^{V} and 1B4B^{V} clustering should also decrease the internal strain energy since boron and Sb (Bi) atoms are smaller and larger than In and As atoms, respectively. Therefore, the formation of 4B10B^{V} and 1B4B^{V} clusters seems highly probable. The study of the 4B10B^{V} and 1B4B^{V} clustering conditions and formation of the weakly strained highly mismatched B_{x}In_{1-x}B^{V}As_{1-y} alloys is presented here.
II. MODEL
InAs-rich B_{x}In_{1-x}B^{V}_{y}As_{1-y} are alloys of BB^{V}, BAs, InB^{V}, and InAs constituent compounds corresponding to the chemical bonds in them. Every atom in these alloys may have the nearest neighbors of two types due to two mixed sublattices forming the crystal structure. Accordingly, lattice site exchanges between cations or anions may transform the chemical bonds in accordance with the bond reaction
or vice versa. Such bond transformation (1) may change a value of the free energy if the sums of the enthalpies of the compounds participating in the reaction are different. The free energy of InAs-rich B_{x}In_{1-x}B^{V}_{y}As_{1-y} is considered as a sum of the enthalpies of constituent compounds BB^{V}, BAs, InB^{V}, and InAs, internal strain energy, and entropy term: f=h+u−Ts. 4B10B^{V} clusters (shown in Fig. 1) are empty boron tetrahedrons surrounded by B^{V} atoms. 1B4B^{V} clusters (shown in Fig. 2) are B^{V} tetrahedrons with boron atoms located at their centers.
Clustering is presented by the fractions of boron atoms in 4B10B^{V} and 1B4B^{V} clusters and is called the 4B10B^{V} cluster order parameter α (4B10B^{V} COP) and 1B4B^{V} cluster order parameter β (1B4B^{V} COP), respectively.
In the sum of the enthalpies of the constituents
one item only
depends on COPs, where Δh_{B^{V}}=h_{BB^{V}}− h_{BAs}− h_{InB^{V}}+h_{InAs} and h_{BB^{V}} is the enthalpy of BB^{V}. Therefore, only this part will be taken into account. The value of Δh_{B^{V}} is equal to the value of the similar relation between the enthalpies of formation ΔhB^{V}0f=hBB^{V}0f− hBAs0f− hInB^{V}0f+hInAs0f since the enthalpies of the elements involved in the enthalpies of formation are self-cancelled. The enthalpies of formation of BAs and InAs are available [6,7]. The enthalpy of formation of BSb was calculated in Ref [5]. The enthalpy of formation of zinc blende BBi and InBi was obtained from the cohesive energies of BBi and InBi and atomization energies of boron, In, and Bi as hBBi0f=−uBBiCoh+uBAt+uBiAt and hInBi0f=−uInBiCoh+uInAt+uBiAt. The closeness of the values of the enthalpy and internal energy for condensed matter [8] was taken into account when using the last formulae. The cohesive energies of BBi and InBi were calculated by Sanderson's approach [9]. The approach is based on two premises.
1. The ionic energy of a bond does not supplement a covalent energy of the bond, but rather substitutes for a part of the covalent energy.
2. When two or more atoms initially different in electronegativity combine chemically, they become adjusted toward an equal intermediate electronegativity in the compound.
Therefore, the cohesive energy is a sum of the ionic and covalent parts. The ionic part is a coulomb energy defined by charge squared over distance and multiplied by the Madelung constant and repulsion coefficient. The covalent contribution is calculated as the nonpolar covalent energy corrected for any difference between the internuclear distance and covalent radius sum
where M_{BBi} and M_{InBi} are the Madelung constants of BBi and InBi, R_{B} and R_{Bi} are the tetrahedral covalent radii of boron and Bi, respectively [10],k = 0.87 is the repulsion coefficient, t_{i}_{BBi} is the average of the partial charges on atoms forming bond B-Bi, and R_{BBi} = 0.2345 nm and R_{InBi} = 2.895 nm are the distances between the nearest neighbours in BBi and InBi [11]. The atomization energies of boron, In, and Bi were taken from Ref [10]. The cohesive energies of BBi and InBi are uBBiCoh=0.577MJmol^{−1} and uInBiCoh=442MJmol^{−1}. The calculated values of the enthalpies of formation are hBBi0f=−164kJmol^{−1} and hInBi0f=−169kJmol^{−1}. The relations between the enthalpies of formation equal to ΔhSb0f=−5.23kJmol^{−1} and ΔhBi0f=−13.18kJmol^{−1} demonstrate the primary BSb (BBi) and InAs bonding over the BAs and InSb (InBi) ones. This preference is stipulated the small enthalpy of formation of BAs: hBAs0f=−30kJmol^{−1} [7].
The internal strain energy of B_{x}In_{1-x}B^{V}_{y}As_{1-y} is
where u_{B}, u_{B^{V}}, u_{4B10B^{V}}, and u_{1B4B^{V}} are the strain energies due to isolated boron and B^{V} atoms and clusters, respectively. The strain energies of isolated boron and B^{V} atoms, as well as 1B4B^{V} clusters, were calculated as sums of two items. The first item is the strain energy of quadruples of tetrahedral cells around isolated boron and B^{V} atoms or central atoms of 1B4B^{V} clusters (shown in Fig. 2). This part was described by using the valence force field model and the approach developed for the estimation of the strain energy of III-V ternary alloys [12]. The bond stretching and bond bending elastic constants of BSb, Bas, and InAs were taken from Refs [5] and  [13]. The bond stretching and bond bending elastic constants of zinc blende BBi and InBi calculated by using the valence force field model [13] and stiffness coefficients from Ref [14] are α_{BBi}=48.66N/m, β_{BBi}=10.65N/m, α_{InBi}=27.89N/m, and α_{InBi}=4.40N/m, respectively. The deformation energy outside the quadruples is the second item. This part was considered as energy of the elastic media with radial displacements inversely proportional to the square of a distance from central atoms of the quadruples. The internal strain energies due to isolated boron, Sb, and Bi atoms and 1B4Sb and 1B4Bi clusters obtained by minimizing are equal to u_{B} = 1.346 × 10^{5} J mol^{−1}, u_{Sb} = 8.727 × 10^{3} J mol^{−1}, u_{Bi} = 1.860 × 10^{4} J mol^{−1}, u_{1B4Sb} = 4.548 × 10^{4} J mol^{−1}, and u_{1B4Bi} = 6.693 × 10^{4} J mol^{−1}, respectively. The internal strain energies due to 4B10Sb and 4B10Bi clusters were also calculated as a sum of the deformation energies of bonds, angles, and InAs-rich matrix. The internal strain energies due to 4B10Sb and 4B10Bi clusters are equal to u_{4B10Sb} = 1.9666 × 10^{5} J mol^{−1} and u_{4B10Bi} = 1.020 × 10^{5} J mol^{−1}. These values were obtained also by minimizing. The obtained strain energies demonstrate a tendency to the formation of both types of clusters.
The entropy term is written as
The entropy was obtained as a function of a number of configurations. This number is a product of three factors. The first factor is a number of permutations of atoms when isolated boron and B^{V} atoms and 1B4B^{V} clusters are distributed at random in a fixed location of 4B10B^{V} clusters. The random distribution of isolated boron and Bi atoms and 1B4B^{V} clusters seems reasonable since the contents of boron and Bi are small. The second multiplayer is a number of the arrangements of 4B10B^{V} clusters. The third factor is a number of permutations of isolated boron atoms and 1B4B^{V} clusters for a fixed arrangement of isolated boron atoms and 1B4B^{V} and 4B10B^{V} clusters. The second and third factors make an insignificant contribution to the configurational entropy. Therefore, they can be ignored when calculating the entropy.
4B10B^{V} and 1B4B^{V} COPs were obtained by minimizing the free energy. The cluster formation reduces the sum of the enthalpies of the constituent compounds, the internal strain energy, and configurational entropy.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The 4B10B^{V} and 1B4B^{V} cluster formation in InAs-rich B_{x}In_{1-x}B^{V}yAs_{1-y} during the growth processes is hardly probable since the boron and B^{V} self-diffusion processes are necessary. The thermal annealing of In_{x}Ga_{1-x}N_{y}As_{1-y} epitaxial films at 670 °C–700 °C during 15–30 min is an efficient method to change the arrangement of In and nitrogen atoms over long distances [15,16]. B_{x}In_{1-x}Bi_{y}B^{V}_{1-y} belong to the same type of alloy just as In_{x}Ga_{1-x}N_{y}As_{1-y}. That is why the temperature range from 0 °C to 800 °C was chosen for the calculations. The fulfilled estimates demonstrate that the 4B10B^{V} cluster formation is more favorable than that of 1B4B^{V} clusters in B_{x}In_{1-x}Bi_{y}B^{V}_{1-y} over the total temperature range. It is due to the larger decrease in the internal strain energy after the polyatomic cluster formation since angles between bonds are deformed mainly in 4B10B^{V} clusters. Moreover, the number of bonds between the highly mismatched atoms in 4B10B^{V} clusters is smaller than that of in lesser clusters with the same numbers of boron atoms in the clusters. The compositions of alloys in which 99.99% boron atoms that can be in 4B10B^{V} clusters are in them at 800 °C are shown in Fig. 3. Curves 1 and 2 are drawn for B_{x}In_{1-x}Sb_{y}As_{1-y} and B_{x}In_{1-x}Bi_{y}As_{1-y}, respectively. 4B10B^{V} COPs of the alloys with ratio y/x ≥ 2.5 and with contents that are above the curves in Fig. 3 are equal to or greater than 0.9999 since an increase in the boron content enlarges the polyatomic cluster formation. All boron atoms in the alloys with the ratio y/x = 2.5 can be in 4B10B^{V} clusters. Therefore, the significant increase in the boron content of the alloys with y/x ≈ 2.5 is caused by the considerable decrease of the entropy if almost all boron and B^{V} atoms are in the clusters. The lower boron contents of B_{x}In_{1-x}Bi_{y}As_{1-y} (Fig. 3) are due to two causes. The BBi and InAs bonding (ΔhBi0f=−13.18kJmol^{−1}) is more favorable than that of the BSb and InAs ones (ΔhSb0f=−5.23kJmol^{−1}). Moreover, the formation of 4B10Bi clusters reduces the internal strain energy more than the formation of 4B10Sb clusters.
The internal strain energies of B_{x}In_{1-x}Sb_{y}As_{1-y} with 4B10Sb COP α_{max} (curve 1) and α = 0 (curve 2) at 800 °C as functions of ratio y/x are shown in Fig. 4. 4B10Sb COP α_{max} corresponds to the alloys containing 99.99% boron atoms, which can be in the clusters and are in them. 4B10B^{V} COPs of the alloys with ratio y/x ≥ 2.5 and with contents that are above the curves in Fig. 4 are also equal to or greater than 0.9999. The compositions of the alloys with and without the clusters are the same for the same ratio y/x and may be obtained by using the results shown in Fig. 3. The internal strain energy of the alloy with the clusters and 2.5 ≤ y/x ≤ 4 is more than three times less than that of the alloy without clusters. It is due to the small strains caused by isolated Sb atoms. Accordingly, such highly mismatched alloys with the clusters are weakly strained. The diminution of the internal strain energy of the alloys with 1 ≤ y/x ≤ 2 is smaller since a significant fraction of highly mismatched boron atoms are isolated. Almost all boron atoms should be in 4B10Sb clusters at 800 °C in the alloys with x ≥ 4.2 × 10^{−4} and y ≥ 10x. The reason is a small decrease in the entropy after cluster formation.
1B4Sb clustering also decreases the free energy but less than that of 4B10Sb clusters. Therefore, the alloys with 1B4Sb clusters should be in the metastable state from the thermodynamics standpoint. Such clusters can be formed earlier than the polyatomic clusters during a thermal treatment since an occurrence of 1B4Sb clusters demands the redistribution of the smaller number of atoms. Rapid cooling of the alloys with 1B4Sb clusters will lead to the “frozen” atomic distribution as self-diffusion processes at RT are very slow.
The internal strain energies of B_{x}In_{1-x}Bi_{y}As_{1-y} with 4B10Bi COP α_{max} (curve 1) and α = 0 (curve 2) at 800 °C as functions of ratio y/x are shown in Fig. 5. 4B10Bi COP α_{max} also corresponds to the alloys with 99.99% boron atoms that can be in the clusters and are in them. The compositions of the alloys with and without the clusters are also the same for the same ratio y/x and may be obtained by using the results shown in Fig. 3. The internal strain energy of the alloy with the clusters and 2.5 ≤ y/x ≤ 4 is more than seven times less than that of the alloy without clusters. Moreover, the internal strain energies of B_{x}In_{1-x}Bi_{y}As_{1-y} without the clusters are smaller than those of B_{x}In_{1-x}Sb_{y}As_{1-y} with the same ratio y/x. It is due to the less boron content for B_{x}In_{1-x}Bi_{y}As_{1-y} with the clusters (Fig. 3). Thus, B_{x}In_{1-x}Bi_{y}As_{1-y} with the clusters are much less internally strained than B_{x}In_{1-x}Sb_{y}As_{1-y}. In fact, highly mismatched B_{x}In_{1-x}Bi_{y}As_{1-y} with ratio 2.5 ≤ y/x ≤ 4 are insignificantly strained. Almost all boron atoms should be in 4B10Bi clusters at 800 °C in the alloys with x ≥ 6.6 × 10^{−5} and y ≥ 10x. This is also a consequence of a small decrease in the entropy after the cluster formation.
1B4Bi clusters that also decrease the free energy should be in the metastable state from the thermodynamics standpoint since 4B10Bi clusters are more favorable.
IV. CONCLUSION
To conclude, 4B10Sb and 4B10Bi clusters are thermodynamically favorable in InAs-rich B_{x}In_{1-x}Sb_{y}As_{1-y} and B_{x}In_{1-x}Bi_{y}As_{1–}y highly mismatched alloys, respectively, over the wide boron, Sb, and Bi content ranges up to 800 °C. The primary BSb(Bi) and InAs bonding over BAs and GaSb(Bi) ones and considerable compensation of the internal strains are the causes of the clustering. The cluster formation transforms strongly strained alloys into weakly strained if the majority of boron and Sb(Bi) atoms are in the clusters. The high temperature treatment may be an effective way to reach the thermodynamically stable state of InAs-rich B_{x}In_{1-x}Sb_{y}As_{1-y} and B_{x}In_{1-x}Bi_{y}As_{1-y} alloys with 4B10Sb and 4B10Bi clusters, respectively. Thus, the studied highly mismatched alloys are promising candidates to obtain the weakly strained semiconductor alloys.
