Negative differential resistance observation in complex convoluted fullerene junctions
In this work, we simulated the smallest fullerene molecule, C_{20} in a two-probe device model with gold electrodes. The gold electrodes comprised of (011) miller planes were carved to construct the novel geometry based four unique shapes, which were strung to fullerene molecules through mechanically controlled break junction techniques. The organized devices were later scrutinized using non-equilibrium Green's function based on the density functional theory to calculate their molecular orbitals, energy levels, charge transfers, and electrical parameters. After intense scrutiny, we concluded that five-edged and six-edged devices have the lowest and highest current-conductance values, which result from their electrode-dominating and electrode-subsidiary effects, respectively. However, an interesting observation was that the three-edged and four-edged electrodes functioned as semi-metallic in nature, allowing the C_{20} molecule to demonstrate its performance with the complementary effect of these electrodes in the electron conduction process of a two-probe device.
I. INTRODUCTION
Since the discovery of carbon nano-materials, they have been referred to as “the materials of the future.” Various types of nano-materials have already been discovered, with more being identified in each passing decade. One interesting classification of nano-materials is the fullerene family, with C_{60} fullerene being the choice of many research groups [1]. This Buckminsterfullerene has been proposed and employed for a number of applications in various streams, for example, in the medical [2], environmental [3], physical [4], chemical sciences [5] or in electronics [6]. Another interesting molecule of this vast fullerene family is the smallest fullerene experimentally realisable, C_{20} [7]. The basic aspects about the geometry of the C_{20} fullerene molecule are fascinating from a research point of view. C_{20} consists of a polyhedral carbon cage of 12 pentagonal and zero (n/2 − 10) hexagonal faces with I_{h} symmetry. Various studies have been conducted theoretically to explain its structure, geometry, and electronic properties, both as intrinsic as well as after infusing certain impurities [8–10].
Though the idea of such experimental implementations on a nano-meter scale was raised in 1957 by Feynman [11], its execution is still underway. One such area of interest is molecular electronics that has matured enough to reveal certain nanometer scale phenomena, such as negative differential resistance (NDR) [12], Coulomb Blockade [13], Kondo resonance [14], etc. The real objective of nano-electronics is to construct a molecular junction device [15] and scrutinize it for its electronic and electrical parameters. In one of our published works, we had researched the pure C_{20} fullerene molecule placed between gold electrodes [16] and compared it with two distinct electrodes made of copper and silver using density functional theory (DFT) based on ab-initio approach [17]. Apart from the material of the electrodes, the morphology of the electrodes played a vital role toward determining the quantum transport. In this regard, we coined the term, “Geometronics” in our previously published work [18], where we designed a set of geometry dependent electrodes of gold using (111) miller planes. The four distinct shapes of gold electrodes were selectively designed for two-probe devices formed by placing the pyridine molecule in between and then explicating the setup using Extended Hückel theory. The idea behind designing the various shapes of electrodes and revealing electron transport through these electrodes was to explore new approaches for testing the applicability of these shapes of gold electrodes, while associating these with pyridine wires of variable lengths [18].
In this paper, we contemplate another type of morphed electrode, constructed from gold electrodes of (011) miller planes, which were been previously scrutinized [19]. The four novel types of electrodes, having three, four, five, and six edges of gold, are created and strung to a C_{20} fullerene molecule using the mechanically controlled break junction (MCBJ) technique [20], as presented in Fig. 1. Such variation is specifically designed to analyze the effect of the electrode's shape, particularly in the electrode-molecule interface region on the quantum transport behaviour of two-probe junction devices for their applications in flexible electronics.
In previously published literature, such different types of geometries of electrodes were considered with benzenediamine (BDA), pointed and flat edged called TT1 and TT2, respectively [21], and where it was concluded that the TT1 has higher conductance as compared to the TT2. This work was limited in elucidating the electronic and electrical parameters of quantum transport at nanometer-scale and specifically concentrated on the effect of heat dissipation and its relation to thermopower. Sharp-edged electrodes have been recently suggested [22,23] and have employed symmetric tolane-type molecules and a linearly conjugated oligo(phenylene-vynilene) dithiol (OPV3) molecule, respectively. No effect from the electrode's shape or its edges on the electrode-molecule interface was explained by the authors in both cases.
II. COMPUTATIONAL THEORY
To probe the overall impact of these four devices on electron transport, we have divided the systems into three subparts: the left electrode, the central region, and the right electrode. While modeling the entire setup, we have selected the MCBJ approach [20], where a single physical contact between gold electrodes and a C_{20} molecule can be adjusted mechanically without inducing any terminating groups along with 1 × 1 × 100 k-point grid for the sampling in the transverse Brillouin plane.
The formalism that we adopted to obtain the results of these convoluted devices is the popular Density Functional Theory (DFT)–Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) method [24,25]. We employed a high-level double zeta polarization (DZP) basis set for all atomic species in conjunction with exchange-correlation potential, Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof–Generalized Gradient Approximation (PBE-GGA) of DFT without compromising precision [26]. The atomic cores are elaborated by norm-conserving Troullier–Martins pseudo-potentials [27]. The electrostatic potentials are determined on a real-space grid with a mesh cut-off energy of 150 Ry units.
The DFT-NEGF method has become the standard approach for modeling non-equilibrium quantum transport in atomistic nanostructures. The electronic parameters can be calculated from the Green's function, and the density matrix is calculated afterward. Next, we calculate the electrical characteristics of the molecular bridge. The current at nanometer scale is calculated from the transmission coefficient using Landauer-Büttiker relation
where f is the Fermi function, EFL is the fermi energy, T_{L} and T_{R} are the electron temperatures of the left and right electrodes, and V_{L} and V_{R} are the bias voltage applied to the left and right electrodes, respectively, with T(E) as the transmission coefficient. The differential conductance is calculated from the transmission function by performing numerical differentiation
III. COMPUTATIONAL RESULTS
As discussed earlier, we have contemplated the four distinct shapes and compared these for both equilibrium and non-equilibrium environments. First, we compute the electronics parameters, namely, the density of states (DOS), transmission function T(E), molecular orbitals (MO), and zero bias conductance. The DOS of a molecular bridge denotes the number of both unavailable and available states present for the number of electrons. Such results are plotted in Fig. 2, with the solid line signifying the density. The DOS for an isolated molecule has already been discussed in Ref [16] and comprises four distinct peaks with its conduction through lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). However, in these convoluted molecular devices, the magnitude of the DOS at the Fermi energy comes out to be 28.74, 36.18, 24.4, and 29.5 for three-, four-, five-, and six-edged devices, respectively. For the three-edged device, the DOS exhibits a high intensity of peaks in the lower energy regime. Moreover, such high magnitude peaks are also visible near 3 eV only in three-edged devices. In the rest of the devices, the density is virtually frozen at a lower energy and only a small portion of it tends to participate in the conduction process similar to that in the (011)-C_{20}-(011) device [19].
Next, the transmission spectra are calculated and plotted in Fig. 2 (dashed lines). The transmission coefficient is calculated directly from Green's function and indicates the stronghold of ballistic transport in the form of peaks at that particular energy level. The intensity of transmission peaks is highest in the three-edged device, while the highest peaks are visible for the six-edged device. The magnitude of T(E) at Fermi energy is calculated as 0.788, 1.075, 0.631, and 1.231 for three-, four-, five-, and six-edged devices, respectively. These values also signify the zero-bias conductance, which equates G_{0} = T(E_{F}) at equilibrium and is tabulated in Table I.
The position of the molecular orbital can also be extracted from the comparison of the DOS and T(E) in Fig. 2. We have evaluated only two immediate molecular orbitals, as only these orbitals actively participate in the ballistic transfer of the density of charges. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the LUMO are positioned at their energy levels in Fig. 2 by vertical lines. The position of the LUMO near the Fermi energy demonstrates the conduction process through this MO level in all the four devices. This behavior is similar to their parent electrode device discussed earlier [19]. The HOMO-LUMO gap (HLG) calculated for all four devices is approximately 0.4 eV and is a bit higher than 0.33 eV, which is that calculated for the (011)-C_{20}-(011) device [19]. This depicts the presence of higher resistance in these pointed-edged electrode configurations. However, this observation fails to explain the effect of the difference of the number of atoms in these four devices with the same energy of the HLG. For this purpose, we computed the non-equilibrium state of these four devices under the effect of applied potential.
The transmission spectrum for the four molecular devices are calculated from the advanced as well as the retarded Green's function along with their coupling functions and is plotted in Fig. 3. The magnitude of the transmission coefficient at different energy levels and discrete applied bias demonstrates the ability of free charge or delocalized electrons to cross the double barrier formed at the molecule-electrode interface. This usually causes hopping in the conduction process and becomes visible in the form of peaks.
The transmission in three-and five-edged devices is quite high in intensity at most of the energy levels, while the four- and six-edged devices clearly show the peaks in transmission spectra at HOMO and LUMO levels. Moreover, the transmission peaks in the six-edged device are highest in magnitude, which would definitely lead to highest conductance characteristics. The transmission spectra pave the way for calculation of their molecular orbitals, energy levels, and HLGs. First, we calculated the energy levels for four molecular devices, which are plotted in Fig. 4. Later, we interpreted the active participating orbital in the conduction process, which are arranged in Table II.
The energy level diagram demonstrates the behavior of the HOMO, Fermi energy, and LUMO at different applied bias potentials. From Fig. 4, we clearly envisage that there are quite higher variations in the HOMO level, especially at higher bias potentials for all the four molecular devices. The odd-edge devices, three- and five-edged molecular bridges, work as nano-devices within −0.8 V to +1 V and −0.6 V to +0.8 V, respectively. Both the even-edge devices, four- and six-edged molecular bridges, work as expected within −0.8 V to +0.8 V, respectively. This indicates that after these particular voltages, the process of breakdown may have occurred, resulting in a change of molecular levels especially at the HOMO level and is evident from Table II.
In general, the molecular devices can work through either HOMO-LUMO-HOMO or all HOMO levels for the applied bias potential. The four convoluted devices work within the HOMO-LUMO-HOMO regime for a different set of bias potentials as indicated above. After these particular sets of bias voltages, a breakdown condition occurs that can be either single or double. In the three-edged device, only a single breakdown condition occurs at −1 V and +1.2 V. For another odd-edged device, it occurs at −0.8 V and +1 V. While for even-edged devices, the first breakdown occurs at −1 V and +1 V. As the charges generated from the first breakdown accumulate and begin to collide with bonds of gold electrodes in the central scattering region [17], the second breakdown condition develops. Such a condition is visible at −1.4 V (+2 V), −1.2 V (+1.4 V), and −1.4 V (+1.6 V) at −ve (+ve) voltages of four-, five-, and six-edged devices, unlike the (011)-C_{20}-(011) device [19]. The voltage points of the first breakdown lead to a change in the HLG of the system by either decreasing or increasing the magnitude as shown in Fig. 5. After the voltage points of the second breakdown, it tends to increase the HLG as the molecular bonds have started breaking up except in the positive bias of the four-edged device. However, there is negligible variation in the HLG of their parent device, the (011)-C_{20}-(011) device [19] with an almost constant HLG of 0.339 eV. Thus, it is interesting to note that the shape of electrode affects the ballistic process in a molecular bridge, and the reason lies in the arrangement of gold atoms and its diagonal plane that are placed in the central region, as is clear from Fig. 1.
Next, we compute the electron density and its charge transfer to compute the presence of asymmetric coupling and metallic material effects between the molecules and electrodes. The electron density, or number of electrons (N), is calculated from the density matrix and is plotted in Fig. 6.
The N for the four convoluted devices is highest at the zero bias voltages and decreases as we increase the bias voltages. This aberration is explained in detail using the free electron model [16], where the delocalized electrons are absorbed with an increase in bias voltages. Moreover, the electron density is higher in magnitude for positive bias voltages in comparison to their negative counterparts. This leads to asymmetry in the coupling of the right electrode and left electrode to the central molecule. Thus, we can conclude that the C_{20} molecule is strongly coupled to the right electrode, unlike the (011)-C_{20}-(011) device [19] which is strongly coupled to the left electrode. The change in coupling to different electrodes is due to different frontal edges. [In this paper the devices are pointed edged, while the (011)-C_{20}-(011) device is flat-edged.] The charge transfer in the central molecule and different convoluted gold electrodes are computed from the Mulliken population and are plotted in Fig. 7.
The charge transfer in the C_{20} molecule is metallic in nature while being placed in (011) planes of gold electrodes only for the small range of −0.4 V to +0.4 V [19], resulting in their dominating effect. However, for this convoluted set of devices, the behavior of C_{20} has been modified and is metallic for a large set of bias ranges. When C_{20} is placed between three-and five-edged electrodes, it reveals a negative charge transfer within −1.2 V to +1.2 V and −1.4 V to +1.6 V, respectively, while C_{20} is metallic in the range of −1.4 V to +1.4 V for both odd-edged electrode devices. This signifies the higher impact of the molecule on the electron transport phenomena in the molecular bridge. Similarly, we have calculated the charge transfer within the gold electrodes from its Mulliken population analysis. The three-edged and four-edged electrodes are of non-metallic behavior at low bias voltages of −0.6 V to +0.8 V and −0.2 V to +0.2 V, respectively. Thus, these devices act as semi-metallic electrodes similar to their parent (111) and (011) electrodes [16,19]. However, five-edged and six-edged electrodes act as metallic and non-metallic for a full set of bias voltages. After the scrutiny of electronic parameters, we now compute their current and conductance values to illustrate the geometric effects through these devices.
We calculate nano-metric current from T(E) by Eq. (1), which is plotted in Fig. 8. The current at a given bias is obtained through integration of the corresponding transmission function between chemical potentials of the gold leads. For a comprehensive view of the current curve, we divided this curve into two segments: (a) 0 V to ±0.4 V and (b) ±0.6 V to ±2 V. The current curve is supplemented by the rectification ratio (RR) (Table III).
The I-V curve in the first segment is quite linear (inset Fig. 8) in its nature with an approximate unity rectification ratio (RR), shown in Table III. Though the deviation began at ±0.4 V of both bias polarities with an RR greater than unity, it led to a non-linear current curve in the second segment. This non-linearity results in a number of peaks and valleys in the current curve, hence demonstrating its negative differential resistance (NDR) [28] at various voltage points. In three- and five-edged devices, the NDR is visible at the same number of points, with the highest deviation from unity RR at ±0.8 V. The behaviors of these devices are quite divergent from their parent device, (011)-C_{20}-(011) that demonstrates no NDR effect in its current characteristics [19]. Similarly, in six-edged devices, the NDR effect is least evident and is present only for higher bias voltages after ±1.6 V. Moreover, the magnitude of current for nano-devices is in the order of: Six-edged > four-edged > three-edged > five-edged. Next, we calculate the differential conductance for four devices from Eq. (2) (Fig. 9), and its quantum of conductance, G_{0} (Ref [29]) is arranged in Table IV.
The differential conductance curves clearly demonstrate the presence of Kondo resonance [30] at zero bias voltage with the magnitude of 1.23 G_{0} and 1.07 G_{0} for four- and six-edged devices, respectively. The highest conductance in these convoluted devices is far lower than that of the (011)-C_{20}-(011) device [19]. In the even-edged devices, the conductance tends to increase after its first breakdown voltage points of −0.8 V and +0.8 V. However, after the second breakdown points of odd-edged devices, it is likely to decrease in magnitude. In the even-edged devices, the differential conductance displays rather abrupt behavior with a low magnitude of conductance, as compared to the odd-edged devices with sudden changes at their breakdown points. Hence, the magnitude of conductance for nano-devices is in the order of: six-edged > four-edged > three-edged > five-edged.
Thus, we can conclude that five- and six-edged devices have a lowest and highest current-conductance value, which results from their electrode-dominating and electrode-subsidiary effects, respectively. However, the three- and four-edged electrodes function as semi-metallic in nature, allowing the C_{20} molecule to demonstrate its performance with the complementary effect of these electrodes in the electron conduction process of a two-probe device.
IV. CONCLUSION
In this research work, we have contemplated the smallest fullerene molecule C_{20} strung to four novel shaped electrodes, constructed from the (011) miller planed gold nano-surface in the field of “Geometronics.” The four devices formed are scrutinized for their various electronic and electrical parameters using the density functional theory and non-equilibrium Green's function. The computed results illustrate the electrode-dominating and electrode-subsidiary effect in five- and six-edged electrode devices, respectively. However, the three- and four-edged electrode devices work as semi-metallic in nature. Hence, the magnitude of current and conductance for nano-devices is in the order of: six-edged > four-edged > three-edged > five-edged.
