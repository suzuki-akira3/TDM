Thermodynamic, electronic, and magnetic properties of intrinsic vacancy defects in antiperovskite Ca_{3}SnO
The density functional theory based total energy calculations are performed to examine the effect of charge neutral and fully charged intrinsic vacancy defects on the thermodynamic, electronic, and magnetic properties of Ca_{3}SnO antiperovskite. The chemical stability of Ca_{3}SnO is evaluated with respect to binary compounds CaO, CaSn, and Ca_{2}Sn, and the limits of atomic chemical potentials of Ca, Sn, and O atoms for stable synthesis of Ca_{3}SnO are determined within the generalized gradient approximation parametrization scheme. The electronic properties of the pristine and the non-stoichiometric forms of this compound have been explored and the influence of isolated intrinsic vacancy defects (Ca, Sn, and O) on the structural, bonding, and electronic properties of non-stoichiometric Ca_{3}SnO are analyzed. We also predict the possibility of achieving stable ferromagnetism in non-stoichiometric Ca_{3}SnO by means of charge neutral tin vacancies. From the calculated total energies and the valid ranges of atomic chemical potentials, the formation energetics of intrinsic vacancy defects in Ca_{3}SnO are evaluated for various growth conditions. Our results indicate that the fully charged calcium vacancies are thermodynamically stable under the permissible Sn-rich condition of stable synthesis of Ca_{3}SnO, while tin and oxygen vacancies are found to be stable under the extreme Ca-rich condition.
I. INTRODUCTION
Owing to their useful superconducting [1], electrolytic [2], magnetic [3,4], and thermoelectric [5,6] properties, the complex oxides have stimulated a huge upsurge in research activities in the last couple of decades. This intensive exploration of complex oxides has been mainly driven by the quest for improving efficiencies of technologically important devices, which has also seen the M_{3}TO (where M = Ca, Sr, and Yb and T = Si, Ge, Sn, and Pb) antiperovskites emerge as a class of materials, which show novel physical properties [1,7,8]. In addition to their promise for replacing the traditional narrow bandgap semiconductors [5], some insulating antiperovskite compounds have also been predicted to have novel three-dimensional (3D) topological properties [9]. A 3D topological insulator (TI) is essentially an insulator in the bulk with special gapless surface states, which allow electrons to move freely on the surface of these materials [10,11]. These surface states of a TI are protected against scattering because of the time-reversal symmetry, making the TI material of interest for the realization of quantum computing [12]. The emergence of topological property in M_{3}TO antiperovskites can be attributed to their peculiar atomic configuration shown in Fig. 1 where the M atoms, located at the faces of the cubic unit cell (space group # 221: Pm-3m), adopt octahedral and cuboctahedral coordination with O and T atoms, respectively [8,13]. An important consequence of this atomic configuration is that the T atoms in the M_{3}TO antiperovskties acquire a negative charge state (e.g., Sn^{4–}) and a strong overlap of p and d states of T and M atoms, respectively, is achieved [6].
Among the M_{3}TO compounds crystallizing in the cubic antiperovskite structure, Ca_{3}SnO (CSO) has attracted the attention from numerous research groups owing to its promise for combining large thermoelectric power and low resistivity [6,9,14] in a single material. This has motivated Okamato et_al to investigate the thermoelectric properties of Ca_{3}SnO in a recent experimental study where CSO was found to exhibit p-type nature with a relatively high carrier density and a large thermoelectric power factor as compared to lead based antiperovskites Ca_{3}PbO and Ca_{3}Pb_{1-x}Bi_{x}O [6]. Since the pristine CSO is expected to show insulating behaviour, the low resistivity observed in CSO samples prepared by Okamato et_al were assigned to the non-stoichiomtery originating from the presence of crystal defects [6]. These properties of CSO can be utilized for superconducting and spintronic applications [1,15]. Earlier, the first-principles calculations have shown that the overlap of the p states of T atoms and the d states of M atom allow Dirac point to appear in the band structure of M_{3}TO compounds [16,17]. In above context, tin and lead containing alkaline-earth metal antiperovskites are potential Dirac fermion systems in which the time-reversal invariance eliminates the spin degeneracy from the surface states allowing these TIs to attain 2D surface states that exhibit momentum locked helical spin-polarization [18]. On the other hand, the strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) interaction of the tin atom in the CSO opens up a band gap at the Dirac point, which provides opportunities for tuning its electronic, magnetic, and transport properties by defect engineering [6,19].
Since intrinsic vacancy defects in solids play a crucial role in altering their physical properties, we note that the narrow bandgap of CSO could provide an opportunity to tailor its properties for spintronic applications. In fact, the experimental observation of stable room temperature ferromagnetic properties in Sr_{3}SnO thin films has been assigned to the presence of intrinsic vacancy defects [4]. Although the unusual properties of CSO have generated a lot of interest in the condensed-matter community, little attention has been paid to exploring the chemical stability of the pristine and non-stoichiometric forms of these materials. From a theoretical point of view, various research groups have employed semi-local and screened hybrid density functional theory (DFT) calculations for exploring the electronic structure of CSO [9,14,16,17,19]. However, it is important to point out here that the complexity of the electronic structure of CSO around the Fermi level (E_{F}) has resulted in conflicting determination of its TI nature [9,14]. Nevertheless, a first-principles analysis of the role of the intrinsic vacancy defects in the thermodynamic, electronic, and magnetic properties of CSO could allow future experimental studies to correlate the unusual properties of CSO with stoichiometry. Therefore, in the present study, we focus on evaluating the thermodynamics of the intrinsic vacancy defects in CSO and explore the effects of stoichiometry on the electronic and magnetic properties of this compound.
II. METHOD OF CALCULATIONS
For evaluating the thermodynamics of the pristine the and intrinsic vacancy containing CSO, the all-electron full potential linear augmented plane-wave (FP-LAPW) based DFT calculations are performed using the WIEN2k code [20]. The exchange-correlation effects are modeled using the Perdew-Burke Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation (PBE-GGA) [21]. A muffin-tin (MT) model of crystal potential is employed by partitioning the crystal space into non-overlapping MT spheres and the interstitial regions containing the core and valence electrons, respectively. Within the MT spheres having radii R_{O} = 1.75 a.u., R_{Ca} = 1.80 a.u., and R_{Sn} = 2.00 a.u., the core electrons are represented by spherical harmonics, whereas the plane-waves are used in the interstitial region for the valence electrons. The core states are treated fully relativistically, while the valence states are treated scalar relativistically. Since the material under investigation contains tin atoms, the spin orbit coupling (SOC) interactions have been taken into account for all the electronic properties calculations [9]. The energy cut-off between the valence and core states is set equal to -7.0 Ry to appropriately treat the deep lying tin p states.
All the calculations were performed with and without spin-polarization for determining the stability of ferromagnetic (FM) ordering with respect to non-magnetic calculations. This permitted us to explore the possibility of achieving stable magnetism in the intrinsic vacancy defect containing CSO [22]. For calculations involving bulk unit cell as well as the supercell structures containing the intrinsic vacancy defects, we have set the charge density expansion (G_{max}), the plane-wave cut-off (R_{O}K_{max}), and the angular momentum (l_{max}) to 18 bohr^{−1}, 8, and 10, respectively. For the pristine CSO, the calculations were performed using a 12 × 12 × 12 k-mesh, and an energy convergence criterion of 10^{−4 }Ry had been adopted for terminating the self-consistent calculations. For the case of supercell structures, the k-meshes have been chosen relative to the size of k-mesh used for the bulk unit cell.
In order to simulate the charge neutral intrinsic vacancy defects in CZO, a 40-atom 2 × 2 × 2 supercell structure of CSO was constructed from the GGA-optimized bulk unit cell with a composition Ca_{24}Sn_{8}O_{8}. The isolated charge neutral vacancy defects in CSO are modeled by removing one Ca, O, or Sn from the 2 × 2 × 2 supercell structure, which is sufficiently large for these calculations and provides reliable results [23–25]. The resulting non-stoichiometric supercell structures of CSO (Ca_{23}Sn_{8}O_{8}, Ca_{24}Sn_{8}O_{7} and Ca_{24}Sn_{7}O_{8}) represent 4.167%, and 12.5% concentration of Ca and Sn/O vacancies. The non-stoichiometric supercell structures were allowed to adopt the space groups confirming to the crystal symmetry and the atomic forces originating from the breaking of bonds were minimized to a value below 1 mRy/a.u.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Structural properties and the stability diagram of pristine Ca_{3}SnO
To evaluate the thermodynamic stability of a ternary compound with DFT calculations, it is necessary to compute the ground states structural properties and the corresponding total energies of the material and its competing binary phases. Since the simplest chemical reaction for obtaining CSO from the two binary compounds is CaO + Ca_{2}Sn → Ca_{3}SnO, we have computed the ground state structural properties and enthalpies of formation of these three compounds using the GGA parametrization scheme. In addition, the structural and thermodynamics properties of binary CaSn are also computed as it plays an important role in restricting the chemical potential limits of Ca, Sn, and O for a stable synthesis of CSO (as discussed below). Table I lists the calculated structural parameters of CSO, CaO, CaSn, and Ca_{2}Sn along with the data reported in the earlier theoretical and experimental studies. A comparison of our calculated structural properties with the experimental data clearly shows the usual overestimation of the lattice parameters by GGA. In all cases, the deviation of the calculated lattice parameters in this study from the experimental values is found to be less than 0.9%. Table I also shows the calculated enthalpies of formation (ΔH_{f}) of CaO, CaSn, Ca_{2}Sn, and CSO, which have been obtained by solving the following equations:
In Eqs. (1)–(4)EtCa3SnO, EtCaSn, EtCa2Sn, EtCaO, EtSn, and EtCa are the minimum total energies of GGA optimized bulk unit cells of CSO, CaSn, Ca_{2}Sn, CaO, Sn, and Ca, respectively. On the other hand, EtO2 is the energy of an O_{2} dimer, which is obtained using the procedure outlined in Ref [28].
It is evident that the calculated enthalpy of formation of CaO presented in Table I is in good agreement with experimental data [29]. A comparison of the calculated ΔH_{f} values for CaSn and Ca_{2}Sn shown in Table I suggests that DFT results are hugely underestimated as compared to the experiment [30]. However, Arroyave and Liu [26] have already identified this disagreement between the DFT and the experimental enthalpies of formation and have assigned the discrepancy in the experimental data to partial oxidation of the prepared samples [31], which is also known to produce erroneous enthalpies of formation for CaO [32]. Since the calculated enthalpy of formation of CSO (−8.405 eV/f.u.) is less than the sum of enthalpies of formation of CaO (−5.921 eV/f.u.) and Ca_{2}Sn (−2.174 eV/f.u.), the chemical reaction CaO + Ca_{2}Sn → Ca_{3}SnO is exothermic and confirms the stable synthesis of this compound [33]. Overall, the data presented in Table I validates the reliability of the calculations reported in the present work.
Since the knowledge of atomic chemical potential (μ_{X}, where X = Ca, Sn, and O) is vital for determining the thermodynamics stability of solids [38], we have used the calculated enthalpies of formation shown in Table I for computing the stability diagram of CSO. For this reason, we exploit the fact that the atomic chemical potential of an atomic species in its stable solid/gas phase is related to the chemical potential of an isolated atom by the relation [39]
For a stable synthesis of CSO, the supposition of Eq. (5) allows us to relate the enthalpies of formation of CaO, CaSn, Ca_{2}Sn, and CSO with the ranges of atomic chemical potentials as
Figure 2 shows the calculated ranges of atomic chemical potentials (Δμ_{X}) of Ca, Sn, and O atoms, which provide information regarding the stability regions of CSO, CaO, CaSn, and Ca_{2}Sn. If CaSn is not considered a competing phase, the region enclosed inside A-B-F-E allows us to obtain the extreme Ca-rich (Δμ_{Ca} = 0 eV) and extreme Sn-rich (Δμ_{Sn} = 0 eV) conditions. However, it is clearly visible from Fig. 2 that only the region enclosed by quadrilateral A-B-C-D satisfies stable growth environments for obtaining CSO, while the regions enclosed by C-D-E-F give values of atomic chemical potentials that lead to the creation of CaSn. On the other hand, the regions below the line A-E and above the line B-F give us the atomic chemical potentials, which satisfy stable synthesis of CaO and Ca_{2}Sn, respectively. This shows that the extreme Ca-rich (Δμ_{Ca} = 0 eV) condition is permissible for the stable growth of CSO, while the synthesis of CSO can only be realized for an intermediate Sn-rich condition where Δμ_{Sn} ≤ –0.971 eV. Consequently, the points A/B and D represent, respectively, the extreme Ca-rich and Sn-rich conditions. The point B also represents the extreme reduction (O-poor) condition where Δμ_{O} = −6.231 eV. Moreover, the Sn-poor and Ca-poor conditions for stable synthesis of CSO are satisfied at point A and point D, respectively. It is clear from Fig. 2 that the extreme oxidation (O-rich) condition (i.e., Δμ_{O} = 0.000 eV) and extreme Sn-rich condition (i.e., Δμ_{Sn} = 0.000 eV) would never result in the production of CSO. Hence, the stable synthesis of antiperovskite CSO can only be realized under metal-rich/reduction environment.
B. Electronic properties of pristine Ca_{3}SnO
Owing to the presence of Sn in CSO, its electronic properties are strongly influenced by SOC interaction. For this reason, we first examine the effects of inclusion of SOC on the electronic structure of CSO. The electronic band structure of pristine CSO calculated using bare PBE-GGA and PBE-GGA + SOC along the k-path R-Г-X-M-Г are shown in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b), respectively. In the case of bare PBE-GGA [Fig. 3(a)], no energy bandgap is observed between the occupied valance band and the unoccupied conduction band states. However, when SOC is included in the band structure calculations, the conduction and valence states between the Г and X symmetry points reveal the typical avoided crossing feature [9]. Figure 3(b) shows that when SOC is taken into account, the conduction and valence bands at the Г-point are separated from each other by 0.207 eV [14], while a fundamental bandgap of 3.5 meV is present between the conduction and valence band along the Г-point and X-point k-path. A comparison of the calculated electronic band structure of CSO shown in Fig. 3(b) with the one computed using semilocal [9] and hybrid functionals [14] shows that our PBE-GGA results predict an avoided crossing feature which is typical of a TI materials. Although this feature does not prevail in the band structure shown in Ref [14], the authors still find the electronic properties of Ca_{3}SnO to be potentially suited for showing topological property.
The differences in the electronic band structures of CSO computed without and with the inclusion of SOC can be understood from the density of states (DOS). We use the modified tetrahedron method [40] for computing the total and partial DOS plots. The top panel of Fig. 4 shows the calculated total DOSs for both cases. It is evident that the inclusion of SOC slightly shifts the valence band states to higher energies. From the partial DOS plots for PBE-GGA + SOC calculations shown in Fig. 4, it can be seen that the Sn-5p states are predominant in the upper valance band of CSO along with a minor contribution coming from the Ca-3d states. The O-2p states in the valence band only start contributing more than the Ca-3d states at about –1.4 eV. The edges of both valence and conduction band states are made up of a mixed Ca-3d and Sn-5p contribution. These contributions suggest that the O-2p orbitals are completely filled, while the Sn-5p orbitals are partially filled. It is noted that the band structure of CSO computed using PBE-GGA + SOC is qualitatively similar to the one obtained by Kariyado and Ogata [16,17,19]. The earlier results clearly suggest that a good picture of the electronic properties of the pristine as well as the vacancy defect containing CSO can be obtained from the calculations performed with the inclusion of SOC.
C. Intrinsic vacancy defects in Ca_{3}SnO
1. Structural and magnetic properties
Ca_{3}SnO has a cubic structure in which the oxygen atom and the metal atoms occupy atomic sites opposite to those in the CaSnO_{3} perovskite structure. In the PBE-GGA optimized CSO cubic unit cell, the bond lengths of Ca-O and Ca-Sn bonds are 2.427 Å and 3.432 Å, respectively. With the inclusion of an isolated intrinsic vacancy defects in 2×2×2 supercell of CSO, the minimization of internal forces results in changes of atomic positions nearby the vacant site. Since a strong hybridization of Ca-3d states with Sn-5p states is evident from Fig. 4, we have performed geometrical relaxation of vacancy containing supercells of CSO with and without spin-polarization. The nearest neighbour (NN) distances (d) of pristine CSO along with movement towards/away from the vacant site (δd) for non-magnetic (NM) and spin-polarized ferromagnetic (FM) calculations are listed in Table II.
The comparison of movements of atoms towards and away from the vacant lattice site shows that the NM and FM calculations have remarkable differences only in the case of Sn vacancy containing supercell of CSO. On the other hand, the relaxation of atomic positions for the Ca and O vacancy containing supercells of CSO does not show any difference. The calculated NM and FM total energies of Sn vacancy containing the supercell of CSO also shows large difference as compared to the other two cases (discussed below). Table II displays the movements of the 1st and 2nd nearest neighbors (NN) atoms towards (negative values) and away (positive values) from the vacancy site in non-stoichiometric CSO for both FM and NM cases. For the case of Ca vacancy, the 1st and 2nd NN O and Sn atoms, respectively, move outwards showing that both these atoms had attractive Coulomb interaction with the calcium atom. As expected, the Ca atoms 2nd NN to the vacant Ca site move inward. In a similar fashion, the 1st NN Ca and 2nd NN Sn atoms of the O site move outward and inwards, respectively.
Contrary to the similar results of the geometry optimization achieved for the Ca and O vacancies, the structural relaxation for NM and FM cases of Sn vacancy results in different relaxed atomic configurations. Although the elimination of attractive and repulsive Coulomb interactions among the atoms show similar trends, Table II clearly shows that the outward/inward movement of the Ca/O atoms near a vacant Sn site is larger when spin-polarization is not taken into account. Since the only difference between the two modes of calculations is the use of spin-polarization, the smaller δd values for the spin-polarized case can be assigned to the correct treatment of the exchange interaction, which attempts to increase the distance between the electronic wavefunctions of the occupied atomic sites by restricting the movements of 1st and 2nd NN atoms as compared to the NM case [41]. This result clearly shows that a strong exchange interaction is present in Sn deficient CSO, which might originate from the breaking of the strongly hybridization Ca-Sn bonds. In fact, our calculated values of the small positive and negative magnetic moments (MM), respectively, at the occupied Ca and Sn sites (Table III) around an Sn vacancy suggest that a ferromagnetic interaction exists between the Ca-3d and Sn-5p orbitals. These results are consistent with the earlier investigation where the intrinsic vacancy defects have been observed as the origin of the stable FM in metal oxides [4,42–44].
To further investigate the magnetic properties of the intrinsic vacancy containing supercells of CSO, we have calculated the difference of the minimum total energies of NM and FM phases (ΔE = E_{nm} − E_{fm}) along with the total, interstitial, and local MM of Ca, Sn, and O atoms (Table III). The calculated value of the total magnetic moments and ΔE (in eV) reveal that both Ca and O vacancy containing supercells are NM, while Sn vacancy containing supercell of CSO is FM. It is worth pointing out here that the ΔE for Ca and O vacancy has been rounded to zero. Since our calculated values of energy for NM and FM case only adopt a numerical value in the 5th decimal place (0.01 meV), the ΔE values are assumed to be insignificant. Moreover, the magnetic moments at 1st (Ca) and 2nd (O) NN atoms of the vacant Sn site show that the total magnetic moments have a main contribution coming from the interstitial MM_{I}. This result can be attributed to the negative oxidation state of Sn in CSO that promotes the valence electrons of Ca to 3d orbitals and upon the creation of Sn vacancy the Ca dangling bond with partially filled Ca-3d states becomes spin-polarized.
2. Formation energetics
The defect formation energy computed using DFT calculations give a reliable account of the possibility of realizing the intrinsic and extrinsic point defects in any material [45]. In the present wok, we have used the following equation for computing the formation energies of Ca, Sn, and O vacancies in CSO [46,47]:
In Eq. (10)E_{t}X and EtCa{3}SnO are the minimum total energies of a supercell containing X = Ca, Sn or O vacancy and the pristine supercell of CSO, respectively. μ_{x} is the atomic chemical potential that varies according to points A, B, X, C, and D shown in Fig. 2. The last term in Eq. (10) is applicable for the computation of formation energies of charged vacancies [46]. In Eq. (10)q = −2, 4, and 2 are used for the fully charged Ca, Sn, and O vacancy cases, while E_{F} is the Fermi level referenced to the energy of the valence band maxima (VBM) of pristine CSO (E_{V}) [46]. The ΔV in the last term in Eq. (10) is necessitated by the choice of referencing the E_{F} to the E_{V} of pristine CSO and has been computed using the potential alignment procedure [46,48]. Due to the finite size of the supercell, the image charge correction proposed by Lany and Zunger [47] has also been applied to the formation energies of fully charged vacancies obtained from Eq. (10).
Figure 5 displays the calculated defect formation energies of the charge neutral and the fully charged intrinsic vacancy defects in CSO under different stable growth conditions. At points A and B, the formation energy of VO0 is smaller than both VSn0 and VCa0, while the formation energy of VSn0 is also found to be smaller than VCa0 at these two points. This shows that the oxygen vacancies are the most abundant form of charge neutral intrinsic vacancy defects in CSO under Ca-rich condition. At points X, C, and D VCa0 is found to have formation energy less than VSn0, while the formation energy of VCa0 is almost equal to the formation energy of VO0 at point D. On the other hand, the fully charged Ca vacancies are the most favourable form of the intrinsic vacancy defects in CSO at point D. This suggests that the charge neutral and the fully charged Ca vacancies can be easily incorporated in CSO under the permissible oxidation condition for the stable synthesis of CSO (i.e., Δμ_{O} = −5.165 eV).
As stated earlier, our calculations disclosed that only the VSn0 vacancy in CSO leads to a stable FM phase. Since VSn0 are found to have smaller formation energies at points A and B, we propose that the realization magnetism in CSO could result from the O deficiency, which triggers the creation of the charge neutral Sn vacancies that gives birth to the ferromagnetic interaction [44]. However, it is well known that the charged anion vacancies are usually more stable in insulating oxide materials as compared to their charge neutral counterparts [46,48–50]. Since a fully charged Sn vacancy (VSn4+) could easily prevent the Sn deficient CSO from attaining FM phase, we have also computed the formation energies of the fully charged Ca, Sn, and O vacancies for comparing their stability with the charge neutral vacancies. A comparison of the calculated values of formation energies of VSn0 and VSn4+ at point A (Ω[Sn^{0}] = 1.790 eV and Ω[Sn^{4+}] = 3.135 eV) and point D (Ω[Sn^{0}] = 3.303 eV and Ω[Sn^{4+}] = 4.648 eV) clearly shows that charge neutral Sn vacancies in CSO are more stable than their fully charged counterpart. Similarly, the fully charged O vacancy is also found to be less stable than its charge neutral counterpart. It should be noted that this finding remains true even when E_{F} is varied from 0 eV to 0.207 eV in Eq. (10) [46,47].
The smaller values of the formation energies for a fully charged Ca vacancy as compared to the charge neutral Ca vacancy is contrary to the behaviour observed for cation vacancies in other complex oxides [48–50]. Similarly, the larger values formation energies for VO2+ and VSn4+ as compared to their charge neutral counterparts are in contrast with the formation energies trends of the fully charged and charge neutral anion vacancies in other insulating materials [48–50]. This behaviour can be assigned to the unusual oxidation state of Sn in CSO and the inverted atomic sites of the Ca (0.5, 0, 0), Sn (0, 0, 0), and O (0.5, 0.5, 0.5) in the antiperovskite structure. Finally, we test the effect of the size of the supercell on the calculated formation energies and the stable atomic structure by structurally relaxing a Sn vacancy containing 60-atoms 2 × 2 × 3 supercell. The difference in the calculated formation energies of the 2 × 2 × 2 and 2 × 2 × 3 supercells (<0.03 eV) clearly shows that the conclusions drawn using a 40-atom supercell are reliable.
3. Electronic properties
To understand the differences in the electronic properties of the pristine and the charge neutral vacancy containing CSO, we first analyze the distribution of the electronic charge with and without the presence of vacancy defects. For a quantitative analysis we have also computed the effective Bader charges (e) [51]. In the case of the pristine CSO, the effective Bader charge of Ca, Sn, and O are found to be +1.302, –2.380, and –1.524, respectively. The negative value of Bader charge for Sn confirms its unusual negative oxidation state in CSO. Since the calculated Bader charge of O (−2) is closer to its ionic limit as compared to Sn (−4), it is inferred that the Ca-Sn bond has a strong covalent character as compared to the Ca-O bond. This covalent nature of bonding between Ca and Sn atoms is also confirmed by the charge density plots shown in Fig. 6 where the value of Δn(r) between the Ca and Sn atoms is larger than the value between Ca and O atoms. When a calcium vacancy is introduced in CSO, the effective Bader charges of its 1st NN O atom and 2nd NN Sn atom reduces to -1.496 e and -2.231 e, respectively. As evident from Fig. 6(a) the electronic charge of anions (O) surrounding the vacant Ca site becomes localized. This indicates that the breaking of Ca-O and Ca-Sn bonds would cause an anion-orbital like defect level to appear in the band structure of calcium deficient supercell of CSO. It can also be seen [Fig. 6(a)] that the electronic charge redistribution after the incorporation of Ca vacancy gives similar charge density distributions for the majority and minority spin channels.
In case of Sn vacancy, the effective Bader charge for 1st NN Ca atom reduces to 1.289 e, while the Bader charge of 2nd NN O atom increases to a value –1.529 e. This shows that the Ca-3d electron for the case of Sn vacancy remains localized at the Ca site. A close inspection of the spin-polarized charge density plots of Sn deficient CSO shown in Fig. 6(b) reveals that the charge density of Ca atoms surrounding the vacant Sn site in the majority spin case is larger than the majority spin case. Since the unusual −4 charge states of Sn in pristine CSO causes the valence electrons of Ca to be promoted to Ca-3d states, the breaking of the Ca-Sn bond gives rise to unequal majority and minority spin charge carriers. Consequently, the Ca-3d dangling bond becomes spin-polarized, giving rise to a stable FM ordering in Sn deficient CSO. This is understandable given that the Sn atom is non-magnetic in nature and only its deficiency gives rise to magnetism in CSO. Contrary to the case of Sn vacancy, the removal of O atoms causes a significant reduction in the effective Bader charge of the 1st NN Ca atom (1.212). This large delocalization of charges from the Ca atom [Fig. 6(c)] does not result in any difference in the majority and minority spin channels. Therefore, both O and Ca vacancy containing supercells of CSO are found to be NM.
Since the PBE-GGA calculations show that the normal ordering of Ca-3d states and Sn-5p states for a trivial insulator are violated in CSO, this material is a potential TI [14]. Figure 4 clearly shows that the valence band of the pristine CSO is mainly composed of Sn-5p states. When a Ca vacancy is introduced into the CSO supercell, the electronic states lying below the E_{F} are shifted upwards giving rise to unoccupied anion orbitals like levels in the PDOS plots shown in Fig. 7(a). There are various other forms of crystal defects (e.g., interstitial, anti-site, and substitutional defects), which can give birth to a hole-doped state in an insulator; however, the location of E_{F} in Fig. 7(a) shows that the Ca deficient CSO may show a p-type behavior. This finding is further supported by the recent experiential study by Okamoto et_al who concluded that the hole-doped nature of polycrystalline samples of CSO can only be assigned to non-stoichiomteric originating from the presence of defects [6]. The removal of a Ca atom results in the breaking of the Ca-O and Ca-Sn bonds, which causes the anion orbitals of the upper valance band to become unoccupied and move up on the energy scale (about 0.5 eV) crossing the E_{F}. Since the unbound O-2p and Sn-5p states have equal number of majority and minority spin electrons, the electronic structure of Ca deficient CSO gives similar results for both spin channels. On the other hand, the removal of an O atom from CSO results in the creation of a defect level that had Ca-3d character and is populated by an equal number of majority and minority spin electrons. This causes a defect level to appear in between the conduction and valence band of bulk CSO with a mixture of Ca-3d and Sn-5p orbitals. The delocalized nature of this defect level, therefore, ensures that the O vacancy gives equal majority and minority spin carriers.
Figure 7 clearly shows that only the case of Sn vacancy leads non-stoichiomteric CSO to spin-polarized states. It is worth pointing out here that it is the mixed Ca-3d and Sn-5p nature of the conduction and valence band, which causes the unpaired electrons to remain localized at the Ca-site upon creation of Sn vacancy. The significance of the majority spin electronic states of Sn deficient CSO can be seen in the upper part of the valence band. The spin-polarization of these Ca-3d states in Sn vacancy containing CSO leads to a metallic nature majority spin channel, while an insulating character is observed for the majority spin channel. These results indicate the possibility of realizing room-temperature ferromagnetism in non-stoichiometric CSO [44]. The spin-polarization of these Ca-3d states in Sn vacancy containing CSO leads to the occupied conduction band states for the majority spin channel. Therefore, the resulting metallic and insulating behavior can be observed for the majority and minority spin channels, respectively, for Sn deficient CSO. The semi-metallic behavior of Sn deficient CSO with room temperature FM makes this material a potential candidate for the quantum computing and spintronic applications.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
We present the thermodynamic, structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of the pristine as well as the intrinsic vacancy defects containing CSO. The calculations are performed using the FP-LAPW method and the effects of the spin-polarized on the calculated properties are evaluated to study the magnetic properties of the non-stoichiometric CSO. The thermodynamic stability diagram presented in this work provides valid limits of the atomic chemical potentials of Ca, Sn, and O for this antiperovskite compound. We find that the charge neutral tin and oxygen vacancies can be easily formed in CSO under Ca-rich condition, while the fully charged Ca vacancy is found to be favored at the permissible Sn-rich condition. Our calculations reveal that only the charge neutral Sn vacancy can give rise to a stable ferromegnetism in non-stoichiometric CSO where a spin-polarized electronic structure is achieved. On the other hand, the incorporation of O and Ca vacancy does not show spin dependent electronic properties. A comparison of the calculated formation energies of different charge states of intrinsic vacancy defects in CSO reveals that the charge neutral anion vacancies are favoured in this antiperovskite compound. It is concluded that a controlled synthesis environment could lead this system to show useful magnetic properties, which may stimulate an experimental exploration of the non-stoichiometric CSO for application in electronic and spintronic devices.

FIG. 1. 
The prototypical cubic crystal structures of perovskite MTO_{3} and antiperovskite M_{3}TO compounds showing octahedral coordination of the face centered atoms with the body centered atom. The M, T, and O atoms are represented by turquoise, black, and red spheres, respectively.
FIG. 2. 
The thermodynamic stability diagram showing the valid chemical potentials ranges, which satisfy stable synthesis of Ca_{3}SnO, CaO, CaSn, and Ca_{2}Sn. The quadrilateral ABCD encloses the region within which Ca_{3}SnO can be produced without the secondary phases CaO, CaSn, and Ca_{2}Sn. The calculated atomic chemical potential values Δμ{Ca},Δμ{Sn},andΔμ{O} for points A, B, C, D, E, F, and X are shown in the inset.
FIG. 3. 
The calculated electronic band structure diagrams of bulk unit cell of Ca_{3}SnO computed (a) without and (b) with the inclusion of SOC interaction.
FIG. 4. 
The calculated density of states (DOS) for CSO. The top panel is the total DOS for CSO with and without spin orbit coupling, while the contribution of Ca-3d, Sn-5p, and O-2p states to the conduction and valance states around the Fermi level are shown in the bottom panel.
FIG. 5. 
The calculated formation energies of the charge neutral and the fully charged intrinsic vacancy defects in CSO at stability points A, B, X, C, and D are given in Fig. 2.
FIG. 6. 
The spin-polarized valence charge density for (a) Ca, (b) Sn, and (c) O deficient CSO supercells. The left and right panels display results for the majority and minority spin channels, respectively.
FIG. 7. 
The spin polarized partial DOS for (a) Ca, (b) Sn, and (c) O vacancy containing supercells of CSO. The results have been obtained with the inclusion of the spin orbit coupling, and the majority and minority channels are plotted together in an inverted manner.
