Photonic nanojet assisted enhancement of Raman signal: Effect of refractive index contrast
We discuss the enhancement of Raman signals using a photonic nanojet generated by dielectric microspheres. The highly confined field of the nanojet leads to an order of magnitude enhancement of the Raman signal from the substrate beneath. Enhancement is observed to depend strongly on the sizes of the microspheres as well as the contrast between their refractive index and that of the sample. Enhancement increases when the refractive index of the substrate increases relative to that of the microsphere, but decreases rapidly as the two become equivalent.
I. INTRODUCTION
Raman spectroscopy is a powerful technique for the characterization of materials and provides a molecular fingerprint of the analytes under investigation. However, due to the poor cross-section (∼10^{−30}–10^{−28} cm^{2}) in the visible and near infrared wavelength range, Raman scattering is very weak. Several approaches have been investigated for enhancement of the Raman signal. These include use of resonant Raman scattering, stimulated Raman scattering (SRS), coherent anti-stokes Raman scattering (CARS), surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), tip-enhanced Raman scattering, and photonic nanojet (PNJ)-assisted Raman scattering, etc [1–9]. These techniques allow measurement of the Raman signal from the sample in different environments with a varying degree of enhancement in signal and associated complexity in the instrumentation required. Among these, enhancement of the Raman signal obtained using PNJ generated by dielectric microsphere has received considerable attention since it provides a simple and cost-effective approach as compared to other techniques. Moreover, it can also be coupled with other approaches such as CARS and SERS for a synergistic enhancement of signal [6,10–12]. Photonic nanojets are an intense stream of photons generated by loss-less dielectric microspheres. These are characterized by subwavelength lateral confinement that can propagate over several wavelengths without any significant divergence [13,14]. As a consequence of this confinement, local intensity often reaches a value that is orders of magnitude higher than the incident intensity. This has been used to enhance the fluorescence signal for a single molecule detection as well as to improve the axial and lateral resolution of the confocal imaging systems [15–17]. In the case of bulk Si and other samples, the enhanced intensity in PNJ has also been exploited for Raman spectroscopy, where an order of magnitude intense Raman signal has been reported by making use of self-assembled silica and polystyrene microspheres [18–22]. The microsphere-assisted enhancement of the Raman signal from ultra-thin films (thickness down to 5 nm) of anatase and subnanomolar concentration of methylene blue has been reported by Alessandri and Lombardi [23]. Chang et_al [24] have reported a Raman enhancement factor of ∼3.6 × 10^{10} by making use of photonic nanojet-assisted Marangoni convection to increase the turnover of analytes in SERS hotspots. The confinement of light in a photonic nanojet generated by dielectric microspheres is known to depend on the refractive index and diameter of microsphere, the excitation wavelength, etc. This has been investigated by Dantham et_al [25] to understand the effect of the refractive index and diameter of microspheres, numerical aperture of the objectives and excitation wavelength. A maximum enhancement by a factor of ∼16 was reported for Si wafers by optimizing the laser spot size for illumination to match the diameter of sphere with 488 nm excitation wavelength. Though these studies demonstrated an order of magnitude enhancement of the Raman signal from Si substrate and other high-refractive index materials, no data exists on sample with lower refractive indices.
In this paper, we discuss the enhancement of the Raman signals using a photonic nanojet generated by silica microspheres of different sizes and the effect of refractive index contrast (RIC) between microsphere and substrate on the enhancement factor. The results show that the degree of enhancement is strongly dependent on the refractive index contrast between the microsphere and substrate. For a given size of a microsphere, the enhancement factor was found to reduce with the refractive index of sample. Numerical simulations show that lower value of enhancement for a substrate with a low refractive index can be attributed to the elongation of PNJ in those samples. Elongation of PNJ leads to a lower enhancement value due to two factors (i) a reduction in the intensity of nanojet and (ii) poor collection of Raman signal from the elongated excitation volume in the back scattering confocal collection geometry. Based on these observations, we propose that PNJ-assisted enhancement of the Raman signal for samples with a lower refractive index can be achieved by decoupling the optical path for excitation and collection to achieve a better collection efficiency. The same has been validated experimentally by demonstrating an order of magnitude enhancement of Raman signal from low refractive index samples such as Ru:LiNbO_{3}, Sapphire, and PMMA. This approach may find applications in enhancing Raman signals from biological samples for rapid identification of pathogens and tissue classification for early diagnosis of cancer, etc.
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
A schematic of the micro-Raman setup used in our experiments is shown in Fig. 1. Raman spectra of different samples were recorded using Witec alpha300 SR Raman microscope (WiTec Instruments, Germany) attached with Acton 2500i, (Princeton Instruments, USA) spectrograph with 600 line per mm grating. The laser lines used for excitation of samples were 442 nm He-Cd laser, 488 and 514.5 nm Ar-ion laser, and 785 nm diode laser. Raman signal was collected in backscattering confocal geometry using a 20×; 0.4 NA objective unless stated otherwise. The backscattered light was coupled to the spectrograph using a 100 μm diameter multimode fiber that also served as confocal pinhole. A notch filter was placed in the detection path to remove the contribution from Rayleigh scattering. A TE cooled (−72 °C) CCD (ANDOR 420BR DD) was used for recording the spectra. Dilute suspension of silica microspheres (Duke scientific, USA) was drop casted on the sample surface and allowed to dry in ambient environment. Raman spectra was recorded from at least 10 microspheres for each sample.
Numerical simulations were performed by solving Maxwell's equation using the finite element method-based commercial software COMSOL Multiphysics 4.2. Since the experimental measurements involve illumination with focused Gaussian beam the standard plane wave illumination used in COMSOL script for solving scattered harmonic propagation was suitably modified [26]. The propagation direction was taken to be along the “x” axis of coordinate system and electric field vibration of the incident polarized light was along “z” axis. Spatial evolution of electric field was modeled using standard Gaussian beam propagation as
where ωx, ηx and Rx are the beam radius as a function of x, the Gouy phase and the radius of curvature of the wavefront, respectively, and defined as
and
All simulations were carried out using direct solver for computing the field. To ensure convergence, the mesh size was refined until variation in the computed field at any given point is <10^{−5}.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Raman imaging of different samples was carried out with the microspheres of varying size placed on the sample surface. In Fig. 2, we show typical Raman image and Raman spectra recorded from the different locations of silicon substrate that had a monolayer of 5 μm diameter SiO_{2} microspheres dispersed on its surface. It can be seen from the figure that intensity of the Raman peaks in spectra recorded through the microsphere is about an order of magnitude higher as compared to that from the direct excitation of the substrate.
In Fig. 3(a), we show size dependence of the enhancement ratio (ER) defined as the ratio of Raman intensity from Si substrate with and without silica microsphere. The measurements were carried out with 50×; 0.55 NA objective using 488 nm excitation. The maximum enhancement was obtained for microsphere of the size ∼3–4 μm. This is consistent with the simulated field distribution of PNJ that shows highest intensity at the microsphere-sample interface for microspheres with size in the range 3–4 μm [Figs. 3(b)–3(d)]. It is pertinent to note here that this observation is in contrast with the results reported by Dantham et_al [25] where the ER has been shown to increase with microsphere diameter. This discrepancy can be understood by realizing the fact that in their experiment, the measurements were performed by varying the distance between microscope objective and sample such that the microsphere is fully illuminated. Therefore, as the size of microsphere increases, the focus of the microscope objective/lens needs to be moved farther away from sample to ensure that microsphere is fully immersed in the diverging beam. This leads to a reduction in the collection of Raman signal from microsphere free region thereby leading to an artificial increase in the enhancement ratio. In our study, we have varied the sample to objective distance in such a manner that the maximum signal is recorded in both the cases i.e., with and without microspheres.
We have also carried out investigations on the dependence of enhancement ratio on the refractive index contrast (RIC) between the microsphere and sample. For a given microsphere, this can be studied either by making measurements on different substrate material with a fixed excitation wavelength or by varying the excitation wavelength to utilize the material dispersion of the substrate. The latter approach not only allows measurement using the same microsphere and sample but also enables investigation of wavelength dependence of enhancement factor. It should be noted here that while the refractive index of silica microsphere varies marginally (1.46–1.45) the refractive index of silicon changes significantly (4.8–3.7) on varying the excitation wavelength from 442 nm to 785 nm. Figure 4(a) shows the measured Raman spectra from silicon substrate for different excitation wavelength. It can be seen from the figure that the observed ER decreases monotonically with decrease in refractive index contrast i.e., with increase in the excitation wavelength. The dependence of the enhancement ratio on refractive index contrast measured using silicon (Si), Ruthenium-doped Lithium Niobate (Ru:LN), and Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) substrates is shown in Fig. 4(b).
It is important to note here that the effective volume of photonic nanojet exhibits (λ_{0}/n)^{3} dependence on the wavelength in the substrate medium [13–15], where λ_{0} is free space wavelength and “n” is the refractive index of medium. One would, therefore, expect that the excitation with shorter wavelength will lead to a higher ER because of better confinement of light with a commensurate increase in the intensity of photonic nanojet. Further, for a given confocal pinhole, shorter wavelengths will allow better collection of Raman signal due to smaller excitation volume. The measured enhancement ratio for silicon substrate upon excitation with different wavelengths are presented in Table I. It can be seen from the table that contrary to the expected λ^{−3} dependence, the relative enhancement roughly scales linearly with inverse of the ratio of the corresponding wavelengths in substrate medium.
To understand this intriguing observation, we carried out detailed simulations for field distribution of PNJ excited with different wavelengths [Figs. 5(a)–5(c)]. It can be seen from Fig. 5 that the length of PNJ increases with wavelength. The elongated PNJ for a given substrate leads to a lower enhancement value due to two factors (i) a reduction in the intensity of nanojet at microsphere-sample interface and (ii) poor collection of Raman signal from the elongated excitation volume in the backscattering confocal geometry.
While the microsphere placed on the substrate helps in efficiently concentrating the light to subwavelength dimensions, it should also efficiently collect the scattered signal by the virtue of reciprocity. However, because of the isotropic angular distribution, only a small fraction of the Raman scattered light is collected. When the peak intensity in PNJ moves to a larger depth inside the sample, which is the case with small RIC samples, this fraction is further reduced in confocal collection geometry resulting in an overall reduction of the enhancement factor [29,30].
We explored the possibility of decoupled excitation and collection geometry to collect the Raman signal from the peak intensity region of photonic nanojet in low index samples like Ru doped Lithium Niobate (Ru:LN) crystal (n_{o} ∼ 2.33) [28], Sapphire (n = 1.7) and PMMA (n = 1.49) samples. Raman spectra recorded from z-cut Ru:LN crystal in confocal collection geometry and the decoupled excitation-collection geometry are shown in Fig. 6(a). Raman image corresponding to 872 cm^{−1 }line of the Ru:LN crystal recorded in decoupled geometry is shown in Fig. 6(b). It can be seen from the figure that under identical illumination conditions the decoupled geometry leads to a higher enhancement ratio. This was achieved by mounting the confocal pinhole on a micro positioner that allows moving the pinhole along the beam path to enable optimal collection from the peak intensity region of photonic nanojet. Similar results were obtained with sapphire and PMMA samples. These results show that in the decoupled excitation-collection geometry, it is possible to achieve an order of magnitude enhancement of Raman signal from low index substrates.
IV. CONCLUSION
To conclude, the results of our studies on the enhancement of Raman signals using PNJ show that the enhancement is strongly dependent not only on the size of microsphere but also on the refractive index contrast between the sample and microsphere. Enhancement increases when the refractive index of the substrate increases relative to that of the microsphere, but decreases rapidly as the two become equivalent. The maximum enhancement is obtained when the peak intensity in PNJ is near the sample-microsphere interface. We have further shown that by decoupling the excitation and collection, it is possible to achieve an order of magnitude enhancement of the Raman signal even from the samples having refractive index close to that of the microsphere. The microsphere-assisted enhancement of the Raman signal can, therefore, be a useful aid in label-free analysis of biological samples. It may also permit recording spectra selectively from different regions of a cell by controlling the nanojet characteristics. The nanojet-assisted enhancement of Raman signals can also be coupled with other technique such as SRS, CARS, and plasmonic enhancement of the field for possible single molecule detection and imaging.
