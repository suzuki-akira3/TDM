Theoretical prediction of high electron mobility in multilayer MoS_{2} heterostructured with MoSe_{2}
Two-dimensional (2D) MoS_{2} has been considered to be one of the most promising semiconducting materials with the potential to be used in novel nanoelectronic devices. High carrier mobility in the semiconductor is necessary to guarantee a low power dissipation and a high switch speed of the corresponding electronic device. Strain engineering in 2D materials acts as an important approach to tailor and design their electronic and carrier transport properties. In this work, strain is introduced to MoS_{2} through perpendicularly building van der Waals heterostructures MoSe_{2}–MoS_{2}. Our first-principles calculations demonstrate that acoustic-phonon-limited electron mobility can be significantly enhanced in the heterostructures compared with that in pure multilayer MoS_{2}. It is found that the effective electron mass and the deformation potential constant are relatively smaller in the heterostructures, which is responsible for the enhancement in the electron mobility. Overall, the electron mobility in the heterostructures is about 1.5 times or more of that in pure multilayer MoS_{2} with the same number of layers for the studied structures. These results indicate that MoSe_{2} is an excellent material to be heterostructured with multilayer MoS_{2} to improve the charge transport property.
I. INTRODUCTION
Two-dimensional (2D) layered material, molybdenum disulphide (MoS_{2}), has attracted immense research interest in recent years as it presents versatile physical properties, such as thickness-dependent electronic properties (for instance, the indirect-to-direct bandgap transition when the size is scaled down from bulk and few layers to single layer) [1,2], inversion symmetry controlled valleytronics [3–6], superconductivity [7–10], and excellent mechanical property [11–13]. MoS_{2} has been considered to be one of the most promising semiconducting materials for use in novel nanoelectronic devices. It possesses a large bandgap, for example, of ∼1.9 eV in single-layer (1L) MoS_{2} [1,2,14]. The field effect transistor (FET) fabricated with 1L MoS_{2} exhibited an on/off ratio higher than 10^{8} [15]. It is known that high carrier mobility is required for semiconducting materials to produce low power dissipation and high switch speed in the corresponding electronic devices. In bulk MoS_{2}, the electron mobility was measured to be 100-200 cm^{2} V^{−1} s^{−1} in the experiment [16]. As for 2D MoS_{2}, for example, for free-standing 1L MoS_{2}, the electron mobility was theoretically evaluated up to ∼410 cm^{2} V^{−1} s^{−1} at room temperature [17]. However, in actual 2D MoS_{2}-based devices, the carrier mobility was observed to be much lower than the theoretical prediction.
According to previous research studies, there are several factors which can have significant impacts on the carrier mobility of 2D MoS_{2}-based devices. One is due to the substrate effects. For an instance, the experiment mobility of MoS_{2} deposited on a SiO_{2} substrate is very low at room temperature (0.5-3 cm^{2} V^{−1} s^{−1}) [18]. It is deemed that the charge traps inevitably formed as a result of the dangling bonds at the SiO_{2} surface severely deteriorate the carrier mobility due to the impurity scattering effect. When MoS_{2} is fabricated onto atomic flat substrates, such as h-BN which is a layered material and relatively free of dangling bonds, a sharp interface can be created to alleviate the impurity scattering effect. As expected, enhanced carrier mobility is obtained in the BN-MoS_{2} system [19,20]. It is also observed that MoS_{2} mated to high-κ materials such as HfO_{2} [15,21], Al_{2}O_{3} [22–24], and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) [25] presents improved device mobility, and the high-κ materials are believed to suppress the Coulomb scattering by modifying the dielectric environment. Another prominent influence factor on device mobility is the contact effect, which has been demonstrated to be crucial to improve the device mobility [26,27].
Those aspects mentioned above are important for optimizing device performance. However, a high intrinsic carrier mobility in the semiconducting material is a prerequisite for a high device mobility. For 2D materials, to take advantage of the strain effect is an important engineering method to tune the electronic properties [28–33]. In previous studies, it has been demonstrated that tensile strain can lower the effective carrier mass in MoS_{2} [28–30]. Accordingly, it can be highly expected that the carrier transport property can be enhanced by introducing the strain effect to MoS_{2}. To exert strain to a system, in contrast to applying an external mechanical strain field, stacking engineering of different 2D semiconducting materials with different lattice constants is a more feasible way. In the present case, to combine MoS_{2} with other molybdenum (or tungsten) dichalcogenides is a reasonable choice since these substances share similar lattice matrix and electronic structures.
In this work, van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures MoSe_{2}–MoS_{2} are constructed by stacking MoSe_{2} and MoS_{2} layer by layer perpendicularly. Tensile strain is thus introduced to the MoS_{2} layer since MoSe_{2} possesses a relatively larger lattice constant (3.32 Å) than MoS_{2} (3.18 Å). Our study shows that the electron transport property can be significantly enhanced in the heterostructures compared with that in pure multilayer MoS_{2} due to strain effects. In the heterostructures, the effective electron mass and the deformation potential constant are relatively lower, and as a whole, the electron mobility appears about 1.5 times or more of that in pure multilayer MoS_{2} with the same number of layers for the studied systems. The rest of this work is arranged as follows. In Sec. II, we describe the method used. Results and discussion are presented in Sec. III. We conclude our work in Sec. IV.
II. METHODS
Our first-principles calculations are performed by using the VASP code [34,35], within the framework of density functional theory (DFT). The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) [36] is adopted to describe the exchange-correlation energy between electrons within the projector augmented wave (PAW) method [37]. Heterostructures MoSe_{2}–MoS_{2} are constructed by stacking MoSe_{2} and MoS_{2} layer by layer perpendicularly. The stacking sequence is MoSe_{2}–MoS_{2}–MoSe_{2} in the 3L, MoSe_{2}–MoS_{2}–MoSe_{2}–MoS_{2} in the 4L, and MoSe_{2}–MoS_{2}–MoSe_{2}–MoS_{2}–MoSe_{2} in the 5L structures. In multilayer MoS_{2} and MoSe_{2}–MoS_{2}, the interlayer vdW interaction is described by using the empirical correction scheme proposed by Grimme (also referred to as the DFT-D2 method) [38] after careful test calculations. The periodic boundary condition is used to simulate the 2D infinite sheet, and a vacuum space of ∼15 Å along the perpendicular direction is used to avoid the interaction between periodic images. The reciprocal space is sampled by a gamma-centered grid of 11 × 11 × 1 k-meshes in the Brillouin zone for both MoS_{2} and MoSe_{2}–MoS_{2}. Structural optimization is applied until the convergence tolerance of force on each atom is less than 0.01 eV Å^{−1} and the convergence criterion for energy is 1 × 10^{−5} eV. The tetrahedron method with Blöchl correction is used to optimize the geometric structures and to calculate the density of states (DOS). Band structures are calculated using the Gaussian smearing method.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Electronic structures of MoS_{2} under strain
As a start, the geometric structure of 1L MoS_{2} is optimized by employing the PBE functional. The calculated lattice constant (a) is 3.18 Å, agreeing well with the previous PBE results [39–41]. In the multilayer system, a vdW-correlated functional should be used to include the long-range interlayer interaction. Here, five vdW-corrected functionals of optB88-vdW, optB86b-vdW, optPBE-vdW, revPBE-vdW, and vdW-DF2 as well as the Grimme empirical method of DFT-D2 are employed to calculate the lattice constant (a) as well as the interlayer distance (d_{L}). The results are summarized in Table I. Since reliable experiment parameters of few-layer MoS_{2} are scarce for direct comparison, the experiment data of bulk MoS_{2} [42] are listed in Table I for reference. According to the calculation results as shown in Table S1 of the supplementary material, the lattice parameters only vary slightly from 2L to bulk MoS_{2}. In the light of this view, the structural parameters of bulk MoS_{2} can serve as a reliable reference for few-layer MoS_{2}. As can be found from Table I, the three functionals of optPBE-vdW, revPBE-vdW, and vdW-DF2 produce much larger d_{L} (3.22-3.26 Å) than the experimental value of 3.08 Å. Conversely, optB86b-vdW generates a much smaller d_{L} (3.03 Å). Obviously, these functionals underestimate (or overestimate) the interlayer distance, and so they cannot describe the interlayer interaction appropriately. In comparison, optB88-vdW and DFT-D2 yield the closest d_{L} to the experimental value. In addition, these two functionals also give rise to the best fit of a between calculation and experiment. In previous studies [43,44], the DFT-D2 method has been demonstrated to be capable of representing the interlayer interaction precisely in transition metal dichalcogenides. In one most recent work by Shulenburger and co-workers [45], it is stated that quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations are more precise to describe the weak interlayer interaction in layered materials rather than the above-mentioned vdW-corrected functionals. Meanwhile, it is shown that the DFT-D2 method produces the closest results to the QMC calculations. In this work, we use the DFT-D2 method instead of QMC considering our limited computational resource. a and d_{L} in 2L MoS_{2} are calculated to be 3.19 Å and 3.09 Å, respectively. The case is similar in thicker and bulk MoS_{2} except that a and d_{L} vary slightly in value (see Table S1 of the supplementary material). In Fig. 1(a), the optimized crystal structures of 1L and 2L MoS_{2} are presented.
Based on the optimized geometric structure, the electronic structures of MoS_{2} are calculated. As displayed in Fig. 1(b), 1L MoS_{2} presents a direct bandgap of 1.67 eV, which is comparable to the experiment value of 1.8-1.9 eV [1,14]. The band structure by taking into account spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is also checked, as seen in Fig. S1 of the supplementary material. As can be found, the SOC splitting (∼159 meV) goes mainly to the valence band maximum (VBM) at the K point. In comparison, the conduction band minimum (CBM) presents a negligible SOC splitting. It is known that MoS_{2}-based FETs are only n-doping relevant [46], and so we will focus on the electron transport property which is evaluated at the CBM. Accordingly, the following calculations will be conducted without SOC.
In actual electronic devices based on 2D materials, strain effects deserve more research interest in order to exploit better device performance because the electronic properties of 2D materials tend to be modulated in a wide range under strain [28–33]. Here, strain (ε) is applied to 1L MoS_{2} by changing the lattice parameter following ε = (l − l_{0})/l_{0}, with l and l_{0} being the lattice parameters with and without strain applied. Accordingly, a positive (negative) value corresponds to a tensile (compressive) strain. The band structures of 1L MoS_{2} under strain (−2%-2%) are given in Fig. S2 of the supplementary material. The results are similar to those reported in previous studies [30,41,47].E_{g} increases under compressive strain while decreases under tensile strain. Here, we define ΔE_{KvΓv}=E_{Kv}−E_{Γv} with E_{Kv} and E_{Γv} being the VBM energy at the K point and Γ point, respectively. Another band energy difference is denoted as ΔE_{QcKc}=E_{Qc}−E_{Kc} with E_{Qc} and E_{Kc} being the CBM energy difference between the Q point and K point. Accordingly, when both ΔE_{KvΓv} and ΔE_{QcKc} claim positive values, the bandgap is direct at the K point. According to Fig. 1(c) and Fig. S2 of the supplementary material, the direct bandgap of pristine 1L MoS_{2} turns into an indirect one under a particularly low tensile strain (ε = 0.5%) with the VBM located at the Γ point and the CBM at the K point. ΔE_{KvΓv} = −47 meV and ΔE_{QcKc} = 343 meV are obtained. By contrast, the direct bandgap sustains under a relatively larger compressive strain of ε = −1.5%. This implies that the electronic structure of MoS_{2} is more sensitive to tensile strain than to compressive strain.
From Fig. 1(c), it is seen that the K-K and K-Γ gaps in 1L MoS_{2} are very close to each other. Hence, the gap energy could be reversed with a slight perturbation. As discussed above, the bandgap transits from a direct to an indirect one at a very low tensile strain of 0.5%. An indirect bandgap could be produced in calculations if the geometric structure is not fully optimized and residual tensile strain remains. In addition, we find that the type of exchange-correlation functional of the Mo atom can change the calculated bandgap nature. With the standard PAW-PBE functional which includes 6 valence electrons, the bandgap is direct with ΔE_{KvΓv} = 15 meV [see Fig. 1(b)]. By contrast, the bandgap appears indirect by using the other two PAW-PBE functionals of Mo_{−}pv or Mo_{−}sv, as shown in Fig. S3 of the supplementary material. ΔE_{KvΓv} are obtained to be −13 meV and −3 meV, respectively. In Mo_{−}pv (Mo_{−}sv), the p(s) semicore states are treated as valence and there include 12 (14) valence electrons. The results demonstrate that the bandgap profile in DFT calculations for 1L MoS_{2} depends on the employed exchange-correlation functionals where a different number of valence electrons are included. This phenomenon is supposed to be correlated with the charge shielding effect. The more detailed physical mechanism requires further future research.
Intervalley scattering has been demonstrated to start contributing to electron transport at ∼100 meV above the CBM at 300 K in MoS_{2} [48]. As displayed in Fig. 1(c), when 1L MoS_{2} is exposed to the tensile strain field, the energy difference between the K valley and the neighboring Q valley of the CBM, namely, ΔE_{QcKc}, appears much larger than 100 meV. In comparison, when it is subjected to compressive strain (ε < −0.5%), ΔE_{QcKc} drops below 100 meV. This means that tensile strain inhibits while compressive strain aggravates the intervalley scattering.
According to the nearly free electron model, the effective carrier mass can be evaluated as m^{*} = ℏ^{2}/(∂^{2}E/∂k^{2}) with ℏ, E, and k being Planck’s constant divided by 2π, the band energy, and the crystal momentum, respectively. From the inspection of Fig. 1(d), we can find that the effective electron masses, denoted as mK–M* and mK–Γ* along the K-M and K-Γ directions, respectively, decrease under tensile strain while increase under compressive strain, which is consistent with previous reports [28–30]. It is noted that the CBM moves from the K point to the Q point when compressive strain is or larger than −2%, and hence the effective electron masses of mK–M* and mK–Γ* for ε = −2% are absent from Fig. 1(d). Based on the above discussion, it can be highly expected that the transport property can be improved by introducing tensile strain to MoS_{2}. In this context, we introduce tensile strain to MoS_{2} through building heterostructures MoSe_{2}–MoS_{2}, which will be discussed later in Sec. III C.
B. Carrier mobility in multilayer MoS_{2}
Before we start the investigation on the electron transport property of heterostructures MoSe_{2}–MoS_{2}, we first study the electronic structures and electron mobility in multilayer MoS_{2} for the purpose of comparison. As presented in Table II, the bandgap width decreases from 1.67 eV (in the 1L) to 1.03 eV (in the 5L) due to the quantum confinement effect. As for bulk MoS_{2}, E_{g} is calculated to be 0.93 eV, which is comparable to the experimental value of 1.2 eV [1]. We calculate the acoustic-phonon-limited electron mobility in few-layer MoS_{2} based on the deformation potential theory [49,50], which has been widely used to evaluate carrier transport in various 2D materials such as phosphorene [51], arsenene [52], BC_{2}N [53], graphene [54], TiS_{3} [55], Ti_{2}CO_{2} [56], GeCH_{3} [57], BN, and BC_{2}N [58]. In this work, the Takagi model [49,51–53,59] is employed. The estimation of electron mobility reads as
where e is the electron charge, ℏ is Plank’s constant divided by 2π, k_{B} is Boltzmann’s constant, and T is the temperature. m^{*} is the effective mass (the definition of which is presented in Sec. III A) in the transport direction and ma* is determined by ma*=mx*my*, with mx* (my*) being the mass parallel (perpendicular) to the transport direction. Eli is the deformation potential constant of the VBM for holes or of the CBM for electrons along the transport direction, defined by Eli=ΔV^{i}/(Δl/l_{0}), where ΔV^{i} is the energy shift of the ith energy band relative to a reference energy with respect to lattice deformation. We use the vacuum energy level as the reference energy level to calculate Eli. l_{0} is the lattice constant at equilibrium in the transport direction, and Δl is the crystal lattice deformation. ρ is the mass density. s_{l} is the sound velocity and can be derived from the longitudinal acoustic (LA) phonon dispersion of ω(k) according to s_{l} = ∂ω(k)/∂k. For the calculations of carrier mobility in phosphorene [51], arsenene [52], and BC_{2}N [53],ρsl2 is replaced by C_{2D} and Eq. (1) is thus rewritten as
where C_{2D} is the elastic modulus, which can be obtained by fitting the expression (E−E_{0})/S_{0}=C_{2D}(Δl/l0){2}/2, where E is the total energy when the system is subjected to a lattice deformation of Δl, and E_{0} and S_{0} are the total energy and lattice area for the 2D system at equilibrium, respectively.
In the present work, Eq. (2) is employed to evaluate the electron mobility. By using the equation (E−E_{0})/S_{0}=C_{2D}(Δl/l0){2}/2, C_{2D} can be easily obtained from DFT calculations with relatively high accuracy. By contrast, s_{l} is derived from phonon dispersion and relatively large disparity between different calculations could be found. s_{l} = 6.7 × 10^{3} m/s [17] and s_{l} = 7.9 × 10^{3} m/s [59] were obtained for 1L MoS_{2} in previous studies. In our calculations, s_{l} = 7.2 × 10^{3} m/s is derived from the phonon dispersion as presented in Fig. S4 of the supplementary material. With ρ = 3.0 × 10^{−7} g/cm^{2}, ρsl2= 155.52 J m^{−2} is obtained. In comparison, C_{2D} is fitted to be 165.23 J m^{−2} by using (E−E_{0})/S_{0}=C_{2D}(Δl/l0){2}/2. It can be found that C_{2D} is close to ρsl2 in value. Accordingly, it is feasible to use Eq. (2) to evaluate the electron mobility in MoS_{2}. It is worth noting that the mobility predicted from Eq. (2) only takes into account acoustic phonon scattering and so is higher than the actual. The effects arising from out-of-plane modes and optical phonon scattering as well as impurity scattering are not included in Eq. (2). So our results correspond to the actual applications where a clean substrate is used to fabricate the devices. In such cases, the impurity scattering is low and the out-of-plane modes are suppressed. However, an investigation on contributions of these modes to the carrier transport property can be an intriguing topic for future research.
By using Eq. (2), the electron mobility under room temperature (300 K) along the K-Γ direction in momentum space is calculated. The K-Γ direction corresponds to the zigzag direction in real space, and strain can be precisely exerted along this direction. The calculation results are tabulated in Table II. In both 1L and multilayer (2L-5L) MoS_{2}, the elastic modulus of the 1L structure (C_{2D} = 165.23 J m^{−2}) is applied to calculate the electron mobility in view of that the carrier transport is confined within the individual MoS_{2} layer. C_{2D} of the individual MoS_{2} layer may become slightly different from 1L to multilayer MoS_{2}. However, a slight difference in C_{2D} will not produce a noticeable change in the estimation of electron mobility. As can be found from Table II, the deformation potential constant (Eli) decreases with increasing layers, which is advantageous to enhance the carrier mobility. However, the effective mass (mK–Γ* and mK–M*) increases with thickness, reducing the carrier mobility. As a whole, the electron mobility (μ_{2D}) is decreased slightly with the increase in the number of stacking layers.
There are two main kinds of methods which have been employed to theoretically evaluate the carrier mobility in 2D materials. One is based on the semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory [17,48,60]. The other common method belongs to the linearized Boltzmann equation under relaxation time approximation, and all the parameters can be obtained from DFT calculations [51–59,61]. The mobility value varies to some extent by using different calculation methods. As in 1L MoS_{2}, the highest predicted value until now is 410 cm^{2} V^{−1} s^{−1} by using the semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory [17]. With a similar method, a very close value of 400 cm^{2} V^{−1} s^{−1} was reported by Gunst’s group [48], and by contrast, a relatively smaller value of 225 cm^{2} V^{−1} s^{−1} was obtained by Restrepo and colleagues [60]. By using a DFT calculation combined with a full-band Monte Carlo analysis, the electron mobility was evaluated to be 320 cm^{2} V^{−1} s^{−1} [61]. In Ref [59], DFT calculations of the phonon-limited mobility within the framework of deformation potential theory were used and the electron mobility was obtained to be 340 cm^{2} V^{−1} s^{−1}. In the present work, the electron mobility in 1L MoS_{2} is calculated to be 311-327 cm^{2} V^{−1} s^{−1}, which is comparable to that reported in previous studies mentioned above.
As discussed in Sec. III A, the intervalley scattering is dominated by the CBM energy difference between the K and Q points (E_{QcKc}). As seen from Table II, E_{QcKc} decreases quickly with increasing layers. In 3L or thicker structures, E_{QcKc} is much less than 100 meV. In such cases, the intervalley scattering cannot be ignored anymore at room temperature. This is not favorable for electron transport in multilayer MoS_{2}. As discussed in Sec. III A, in MoS_{2}, the intervalley scattering can be inhibited by applying tensile strain. This effect is verified in heterostructures MoSe_{2}–MoS_{2} in which tensile strain is introduced to the MoS_{2} component due to the lattice mismatch, which will be discussed later in Sec. III D.
C. Electronic structures in bilayer heterostructure MoSe_{2}–MoS_{2}
As mentioned above, to take advantage of strain effects is an effective method to improve the transport property in 2D MoS_{2}. Usually, it is not practical to introduce mechanical strain externally to a semiconducting material which is integrated in an electronic device. Instead, stacking engineering of different 2D semiconducting materials with different lattice constants is a more feasible way. MoS_{2} can be combined with other molybdenum (or tungsten) dichalcogenides (designated as MX_{2}: M = Mo, W; X = S, Se) considering these substances share similar lattice matrix and electronic structures. Among MX_{2}, WS_{2} has almost the same lattice constant as MoS_{2}, and thus, the strain effect cannot be effectively introduced. When MoS_{2} is combined with WSe_{2}, the heterostructure presents a narrow bandgap [62,63], which is not favorable for the applications in electronic devices. In our calculations, the bandgap of 2L WSe_{2}–MoS_{2} is 0.58 eV (see Fig. S5 of the supplementary material) and further decreased values are observed for thicker structures.
In the present work, MoS_{2} is hybridized with MoSe_{2}. Since MoSe_{2} has a relatively larger lattice constant (3.32 Å, PBE) than MoS_{2} (3.18 Å, PBE), strain is thus introduced to the MoS_{2} component due to the lattice mismatch (∼4%). Three typical configurations of AA-, R-, and C7-type are constructed, as displayed in Figs. 2(a)–2(c). The lattice constant a is optimized to be about 3.25 Å for all the three structures. Accordingly, a tensile strain of ∼2.2% is introduced to the MoS_{2} layer. The interlayer separation d_{L} is evaluated to be 3.73 Å, 3.14 Å, and 3.12 Å for the three structures, respectively. As can be found, the interlayer separation in the AA-stacking is much larger than that in the other two. Correspondingly, the interlayer binding is much weaker in the AA-stacking, which is beyond our study in the following discussion. The latter two are almost equally stable. The interlayer adsorption energy of the C7-stacking (−195 meV/atom) is only 1 meV/atom lower than that of the R-stacking (−194 meV/atom). In Ref [63], the C7-stacking was also shown to give rise to the lowest total energy. By contrast, in the research by Kang and co-workers [43], the R-stacking yielded the lowest energy; however, the energy difference between the C7- and T-stacking was shown to be within 1-4 meV. These results indicate that both the R- and C7-stacking could be obtained in the experiment.
As indicated in Figs. 2(e) and 2(f), the R and C7 structures exhibit similar band structures. Both structures present a direct bandgap at the K point. ΔE_{KvΓv} are evaluated to be 48 meV and 13 meV, respectively. E_{g} is 0.66 eV for the R structure and 0.72 eV for the C7 structure. It is worth mentioning that the bandgap of the AA structure also appears direct [Fig. 2(d)], and E_{g} and ΔE_{KvΓv} are 0.67 eV and 264 meV, respectively. Our result is consistent with Kang’s report [43], in which the same method of GGA-PBE with the empirical Grimme scheme was used and the bandgap was shown to be direct in all the studied structures of 2L MoSe_{2}–MoS_{2}. However, the nature of the bandgap in the C7-stacking is still an open issue. An indirect bandgap with the VBM at the Γ point and the CBM at the K point was predicted by using different calculation methods [63,64]. Nevertheless, it can be found that the VBM at the K and Γ points is very close in energy in all these studies. These results indicate that the VBM is possibly located at the K or at the Γ point depending on the employed calculation method. It can be deemed that 2L MoSe_{2}–MoS_{2} possesses an almost direct bandgap. By contrast, pure 2L MoS_{2} is a typical indirect bandgap semiconductor with ΔE_{KvΓv} of −446 meV (see Table II). This suggests that 2L MoSe_{2}–MoS_{2} is preferable to 2L MoS_{2} in electronic device applications with regard to the direct bandgap nature. Similar to the case of MoS_{2} as discussed above, the SOC splitting in MoSe_{2}–MoS_{2} goes mainly to the VBM at the K point (see Fig. S6 of the supplementary material). Since such splitting does not affect the electron transport property which is derived from the CBM, it will not be included in the following calculations.
As can be found from the total DOS and stacking-layer-resolved partial DOS (PDOS) as shown in Fig. 3, the CBM of heterostructure MoSe_{2}–MoS_{2} is dominated by the electronic states of the MoS_{2} component. Accordingly, the electron transport property in the heterostructure will be mainly manipulated by the MoS_{2} layer. We have known from the above discussions that tensile strain is introduced to MoS_{2} after it is stacked with MoSe_{2}, and in addition, tensile strain can decrease the effective mass and increase ΔE_{QcKc} in MoS_{2}. Hence, it is highly expected that the electron transport performance in heterostructures MoSe_{2}–MoS_{2} can be enhanced compared to that in pure multilayer MoS_{2}. In Sec. III D, electron mobility in multilayer heterostructures MoSe_{2}–MoS_{2} will be discussed.
D. Electron mobility in multilayer heterostructures MoSe_{2}–MoS_{2}
As discussed above, 2L MoSe_{2}–MoS_{2} presents a direct bandgap. As additional layers are added (N_{L} > 2), the bandgap turns into indirect in both the R (Fig. S7 of the supplementary material) and C7 (Fig. 4) configurations with the CBM at the K point and VBM at the Γ point. We use the C7-stacking as the representative for the following calculations. To further evaluate the stability as well as the interface quality of C7-stacking MoSe_{2}–MoS_{2}, ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are conducted at two temperatures of 300 K and 600 K. As shown in Fig. S8 with lattice_{−}300K.mpg and lattice_{−}600K.mpg in the supplementary material, the structural symmetry almost remains unchanged within 3 ps at both the temperatures, which demonstrates that the C7 configuration for heterostructure MoSe_{2}–MoS_{2} is favorable with good stability and high interface quality.
By employing the C7 configuration, the electronic structure as well as the electron transport property in multilayer MoSe_{2}–MoS_{2} is studied. As listed in Table III, ΔE_{KvΓv} changes from 13 meV at N_{L} = 2 (direct bandgap) to negative values with N_{L} > 2 (indirect bandgap). E_{g} between VBM and CBM decreases from 0.72 eV in 2L MoSe_{2}–MoS_{2} to 0.52 eV in the 5L structure. It is interesting to find that multilayer MoSe_{2}–MoS_{2} presents much larger ΔE_{QcKc} (373-527 meV) than pure multilayer MoS_{2} (9-127 meV). All the ΔE_{QcKc} in MoSe_{2}–MoS_{2} are much higher than 100 meV, indicating that the intervalley scattering can be inhibited effectively. These results strongly verify the prediction made in Sec. III B. Besides, it can be found by comparing Tables II and III that the effective electron masses in heterostructures MoSe_{2}–MoS_{2} become smaller than those in pure MoS_{2}. This is because tensile strain is introduced to MoS_{2} in the heterostructures. Meanwhile, it can be seen that the deformation potential constant Eli in the heterostructures is relatively lower than that in pure multilayer MoS_{2}. It seems to be relevant to the fact that Eli of MoSe_{2} is relatively smaller than that of MoS_{2}. For instance, Eli of 7.37 ± 0.02 eV is obtained for 2L MoSe_{2} and 8.10 ± 0.11 eV for 2L MoS_{2}, which are comparable to those obtained in polytype 2L MoS_{2} (5.65-6.04 eV) by using a similar fitting method [65].Eli (7.77 ± 0.10 eV) of 2L MoSe_{2}–MoS_{2} appears in between those of 2L MoSe_{2} and 2L MoS_{2}. As far as the 2D elastic modulus C_{2D} is concerned, similar to the case in pure multilayer MoS_{2}, C_{2D} of 1L MoS_{2} is used to calculate the electron mobility μ_{2D} of the heterostructures with consideration of that the electron transport is confined within the individual MoS_{2} layer.
From the inspection of Tables II and III, we find that the electron mobility μ_{2D} is significantly increased in heterostructures MoSe_{2}–MoS_{2}. μ_{2D} in 2L MoSe_{2}–MoS_{2} is about 1.5 times of that in 2L MoS_{2}, while in 3L-5L MoSe_{2}–MoS_{2}, it is about 1.7-1.8 times of that in the counterparts. The results are consistent with the previous report [66], in which it is shown that the electron mobility of 1L MoS_{2} is increased by about 43%-53% with tensile strain applied along the zigzag direction. Our results suggest that electron transport in MoS_{2} can be effectively enhanced by taking advantage of the strain effect by stacking the heterostructures. In actual electronic devices, 2D semiconducting multilayer MoSe_{2}–MoS_{2} is supposed to be mated to an insulating substrate. As a multilayer structure, the unfavorable factors such as the impurity scattering arising from the semiconductor-insulator interface can be effectively screened by the layers close to the substrate. In this way, the intrinsic high carrier mobility can be reserved in the layers relatively apart from the substrate and an outstanding device performance can be highly expected.
IV. CONCLUSION
In the present work, multilayer heterostructures MoSe_{2}–MoS_{2} are constructed by stacking MoSe_{2} and MoS_{2} layer by layer perpendicularly. First-principles DFT calculations and the acoustic phonon-limited approach within the framework of deformation potential theory are employed to investigate the electronic structures and electron transport properties. In the heterostructures, tensile strain is introduced to the MoS_{2} layer due to the lattice mismatch effect. Accordingly, the effective electron mass becomes smaller than that in pure MoS_{2}. Meanwhile, the deformation potential constant is decreased in the heterostructures. As a result, the acoustic-phonon-limited electron mobility is increased significantly in the heterostructures of MoSe_{2}–MoS_{2}, which is about 1.5-1.8 times of that in pure MoS_{2} of the same number of layers for the studied structures. The results demonstrate that the electron transport property in 2D MoS_{2} can be effectively enhanced by taking advantage of the strain effect through building heterostructures MoSe_{2}–MoS_{2}. Such a strain engineering method would be a new feasible way to improve the carrier transport property not only in MoS_{2} but also in other 2D materials.
