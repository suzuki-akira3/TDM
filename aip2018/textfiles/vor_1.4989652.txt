Cylindrical and spherical Akhmediev breather and freak waves in ultracold neutral plasmas
The properties of cylindrical and spherical ion-acoustic breathers Akhmediev breather and freak waves in strongly coupled ultracold neutral plasmas (UNPs), whose constituents are inertial strongly coupled ions and weakly coupled Maxwellian electrons, are investigated numerically. Using the derivative expansion method, the basic set of fluid equations is reduced to a nonplanar (cylindrical and spherical)/modified nonlinear Schrödinger equation (mNLSE). The analytical solutions of the mNLSE were not possible until now, so their numerical solutions are obtained using the finite difference scheme with the help of the Dirichlet boundary conditions. Moreover, the criteria for the existence and propagation of breathers are discussed in detail. The geometrical effects due to the cylindrical and spherical geometries on the breather profile are studied numerically. It is found that the propagation of the ion-acoustic breathers in one-dimensional planar and nonplanar geometries is very different. Finally, our results may help to manipulate matter breathers experimentally in UNPs.
I. INTRODUCTION
There is a growing concern in studying nonlinear phenomena that appear in many scientific areas such as mathematical biology, fluid dynamics, solid state physics, plasma physics, fiber optics, etc [1–3]. Rogue wave (RW), also known as freak wave (FW), is one of the most important phenomena that arises in nonlinear nonlinear-dispersive media [4–15]. There are potential applications of rogue waves (RWs), and thus it is important to understand their origin and develop methods to create them in a controllable way. Thus, to understand the origin of the RW mechanism, which appears from nowhere in physical systems and unexpectedly disappears without a trace, we should look for special conditions to avoid, or to generate these waves in the required moment because it would be of great benefit in some areas such as biophysics and optical media. For example, in biophysics, we expect that these waves can be generated in a time when one wants them to overcome blood clots, but this requires examining these waves in a nonplanar geometry. A number of various physical mechanisms have been proposed to explain unexpected emergence of the RW. The most common physical mechanism that has been used to interpret the occurrence of RW in nonlinear-dispersive media is called the modulational instability (MI), which is a universal phenomenon that occurs in many physical systems and it is used to describe the high concentration of energetic pulses into a small local area of a system under study. The nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE) is one of the most important equations that is used to govern the dynamics of many nonlinear structures in many branches of physics. The rational solution of the NLSE can describe the propagation of breathers [Akhmediev breather (AB), Kuznetzov-Ma (KM) solitons, and RWs] [16]. The problem of the creation and propagation of the one-dimensional (1D) planar breathers in different plasmas has been treated by numerous theoretical and experimental investigations [5,6,11,12,17–22]. Nevertheless, there are still some interesting and relevant problems to be addressed. Until now, all investigations of ion-acoustic breathers have been limited to 1D planar geometry, which may not be practical in all situations in laboratory devices [12]. However, the nonlinear structures observed in laboratory devices [12] and in the auroral region, especially at the higher polar altitudes [23], are certainly not bounded in 1D planar geometry, but usually in a nonplanar geometry. Therefore, in the present study, we investigate the existence and propagation of the ion-acoustic breathers in nonplanar (cylindrical and spherical) geometry in strongly coupled ultracold neutral plasmas (UNPs), whose constituents are inertial strongly coupled ions and weakly coupled electrons. The Boltzmann law for the electron number density is used in UNPs [24,25]. As it is known and confirmed in many experimental and theoretical published papers that in UNPs Coulomb interaction energy between nearest neighbors can be much larger than the thermal energy of the charged particles (mostly ions), making them strongly coupled systems [25] (similar to strongly coupled dusty plasmas [26]). The degree of correlations is characterized by the Coulomb coupling parameter (CCP) Γ, which is the ratio between the Coulomb interaction energy between charged particles (average electrostatic energy) and the average kinetic energy [27]. Experiments of UNPs have shown that ions equilibrate with 2 < Γ_{i} < 5 (Ref [28]) and electrons equilibrate with Γ_{e} < 0.2 [29].
II. PHYSICAL MODEL AND EVOLUTION EQUATION
The propagation of nonlinear ion-acoustic breathers in the 1D planar strongly coupled UNPs with nonthermal electrons has been investigated by El-Tantawy et_al [21] However, to the best of our knowledge, studying the ion-acoustic breathers in the nonplanar UNPs whose constituents are strongly coupled ions and weakly coupled Maxwellian electrons has not been investigated yet. Therefore, our motivation is to investigate the ion-acoustic breathers in UNPs. In this type of plasma, electrons are weakly coupled because of their smaller electric charges and higher temperatures, whereas the ions are strongly correlated to each other, i.e., strongly coupled due to their larger electric charge and lower temperature. At equilibrium, we have ne(0)=Z_{i}ni(0)=n^{(0)}, where ne(0)(ni(0)) is the equilibrium or unperturbed electron (ion) number density and Z_{i} is the ion charge state. To study the dynamics of the nonlinear structures in the nonplanar UNPs, we assume that the ion-acoustic waves (IAWs) propagate in an axially symmetric cylindrical/spherical geometry and taking perturbation in the radial direction only. Therefore, the nonlinear dynamics of the nonplanar IAWs in UNPs (whose phase speed is higher than the ion thermal speed but much smaller than the electron thermal speed) can be investigated by means of the well-known generalized hydrodynamic (GH) equations as follows:
and
where ν = 0/1/2 for planar/cylindrical/spherical geometry. Here, n_{i} and u_{i} are the density and the radial velocity of the ion fluid, respectively, ϕ is the electrostatic potential, t and r are the time and radial space variables, m_{i} and Z_{i} are the ion mass and charge state, and k_{B} and e are the Boltzmann constant and the magnitude of the electron charge, respectively. τ_{m} refers to the viscoelastic relaxation time; ζ_{b} and η_{s} are the transport coefficients of the bulk and shear viscosities. T_{if} = (μ_{i}T_{i} + T_{*}) represents the effective ion temperature, where T_{*} arises due to electrostatic interactions between strongly coupled positive ions and μ_{i} is the isothermal compressibility factor of the ion fluid [30]. There are various approaches to calculate τ_{m}, ζ_{b}, η_{s}, T_{*}, and μ_{i}, which have been widely discussed in the literature (see, for example, Refs [25] and  [31–33]).
A reductive perturbation technique (the derivative expansion method) is introduced to examine the dynamics of the nonplanar envelope IAWs in UNPs. According to this technique, the independent variables are stretched as χ = ε(r − V_{g}t) and τ = ε^{2}t, where ε is a real and small (ε ≪ 1) parameter and V_{g} the envelope group velocity, and the dependent variables are expanded as [34]
where Ψ≡Ψ(r,t)=[ni(r,t)ui(r,t)ϕ(r,t)]{T},Ψ^{(0)}=[ni(0)00]{T}, k and ω are the fundamental wavenumber and the frequency of the carrier wave, respectively. All elements of the vector Ψl(m) satisfy the reality condition Ψ−l(m)=Ψl∗(m), where the asterisk indicates the complex conjugate and T stands for the transpose. It should be mentioned here that the above stretching coordinates and the expanded variables introduce two different forms of coordinate systems, one of them is (r, t), in which a fast variation of the carrier wave exists, and the other is (χ, τ) for a slowly modulated wavepacket. Substituting expansion (4) along with stretching coordinates into Eqs. (1)–(3), we get a set of reduced equations. Collecting terms of the same powers of ε and different cases for m and l, and after a tedious yet straightforward calculation, we obtain the nonplanar/modified NLSE from the compatibility condition (omitting details)
where φ≡ϕ1(1). The coefficients of the dispersion and the nonlinear terms, P and Q, respectively, are given by
where A_{1}, A_{2}, and A_{3} are given in the Appendix. More details about the derivation of Eq. (5) planar case (ν = 0) can be found in detail in Ref [21] by considering Maxwellian distribution for the electron density. Note that, for planar geometry (ν = 0), Eq. (5) reduces to the standard NLSE (6) in Ref [33]. In our case, it is shown from the above calculations that strong-coupling modification enters through the contribution of term k_{B}T_{if}∂n_{i}/∂r due to T_{if}.
III. MODULATIONAL INSTABILITY OF THE NONPLANAR IAWs
The analysis of the modified NLSE (5) prognosticates the existence of either stable or unstable envelope pulses. In order to identify the (in)stability regions of the nonplanar (ν ≠ 0) ion-acoustic envelope wavepackets, we must study the MI of these waves. The MI of the nonplanar ion-acoustic envelope waves can be investigated by considering a small perturbation of the wave's amplitude and examining the associated dispersion relation. Depending on the standard/linear stability analysis [35], the nonlinear dispersion relation for the small amplitude modulation of the ion acoustic wavepackets can be obtained. The derivation of this relation can be found in detail; in Ref [35], the final form is given as
with
where K_{c} ≡ K_{c}(τ) is the modulational critical wavenumber, ϕ_{0} is the pump carrier wave, Ω(≪ ω) and K(≪ k) are the frequency and the wavenumber of the modulation wave, respectively. Note that for v = 0, the relation (6) reduces to the planar case. Remember that the frequency Ω and the wavenumber K of the slow modulation are in the slow scales (χ, τ), while the rapid carrier wave quantities ω and k are in the fast scales (r, t). It is straightforward to see that the sign of the product PQ is insufficient to determine the regions of stable or unstable nonplanar envelope pulses because K_{c} depends on the time τ. Therefore, the nonplanar modulated wave becomes stable if PQ < 0 and K^{2}>Kc2 are satisfied. As a result, Ω is always a real number and the wave does not grow. On the contrary, for PQ > 0 and K^{2}<Kc2, the carrier waves become modulationally unstable and Ω becomes imaginary and the wave will grow. In this case, the local instability growth rate is given by [34,35]
It is clear from relation (7) that there is a MI period for the nonplanar wave modulation and this instability period does not exist in the planar case. It is observed that at τ=τ_{max}, the frequency Ω equals zero, and the growth of the wave breaks. After that when τ>τ_{max}, Ω^{2} > 0 and the envelope wave becomes modulationally stable. Thus, at K^{2}=Kc2, one gets [34]
Condition (8) demonstrates that the modulation instability period τ_{max} of spherical geometry (ν = 2) is lower than for cylindrical geometry (ν = 1), which means that the envelope spherical pulse is more structurally stable to perturbations than the cylindrical one [35].
IV. NUMERICAL CALCULATIONS AND BREATHER WAVE OF MNLSE
Depending on the above calculations of the MI and within the MI region, a random perturbation of the amplitude grows and may generate breather waves in the unstable regions. It is known that the analytical solutions of Eq. (5) are not possible until now due to the presence of a geometrical term [iφ(v/2τ)]. However, for the planar case (v = 0), the general first-order breather type solutions of the planar NLSE on a finite background (|φ(χ,τ→±∞)|)→P/Q can be written as follows [6,36–39]:
where a is the single governing parameter that determines the kind of the breather waves, b_{1}=2ab_{2} and b_{2}=4(1−2a). For 0 < a < 0.5, the solution (9) describes the AB (φ_{AB}), which is localized in time and periodic in space with spatial period 2π/b_{2} as shown in Fig. 1(a). This wave is formed due to nonlinear compression of a modulated plane wave (modulational instability). This solution approaches the plane wave as τ → ±∞. For a → 0.5, the solution (9) reduces to the well-known rogue wave (φ_{RW}), which is localized both in time and space as depicted in Fig. 1(b). Our main interest here is to examine the effect of the nonplanar geometry on the breather structures for typical laboratory plasma parameters: the ions are excited on the primary Sr^{+} transition with Z_{i} = 1, m_{i} = 88 m_{p}, T_{e} ∼ (1–1000) K, T_{i} = 1 K, ne(0)≈Z_{i}ni(0)≈n^{(0)}=(10^{9}−10^{15}) cm^{−3}, and no magnetic field is applied [24,40]. Following the assumption of Castro et_al [24], we assume that T_{e} ≫ T_{i}, because Landau damping is too strong to observe IAWs for T_{e} ≤ T_{i}, and hence, there is not much interest for this study. According to the last laboratory parameters, the electron Debye radius λ_{De} in UNPs is typically of the order of 30 μm, which is much smaller than the length of the plasma system (typically of the order of 200 μm), and the electron and ion Coulomb coupling parameters for UNPs are, respectively, Γ_{e} ≈ 0.0135 and Γ_{i} ≈ 2.2. Furthermore, the time scale of the IAWs τ_{IAWs} is nearly of the order of ≈ 245 ns, which is much smaller than the lifetime of UNPs (50–200 μs) [25,27].
Figure 2 shows the regions of modulational stability [white regions (PQ < 0)] and unstable [color region (PQ > 0)] pulses and the variation of the maximum RW amplitude φ(0,0)=3P/Q with the wavenumber k(cm^{−1}) and the electron temperature T_{e}(Kelvin). The back-thick line clarifies the critical wavenumber k_{c}=(2Q|ϕ_{0}|^{2})/(P̃) for the planar case (ν = 0), which indicates where the MI sets in. As evident from Fig. 2, the maximum RW amplitude becomes high near the critical wavenumber k_{c} because the IAWs suck more energy from the surrounding waves in a small area and therefore concentrate a significant amount of energy which makes the pulses taller. On the contrary, as we are far away from k_{c}, the IAWs dissipate their energy to the surrounding environment, leading to the reduction of the nonlinearity and therefore pulses become lower.
As we mentioned above, an analytical solution of Eq. (5) is not possible until now for breather waves. Thus, to examine the effects of the cylindrical and spherical geometries on the propagation dynamics of the AB and RW solutions, Eq. (5) will be solved numerically. With the help of a MATHEMATICA based finite difference scheme, the numerical solutions of Eq. (5) for the AB and RW pulses are obtained. The breather solutions given in Eq. (9) will be used as an initial condition to analyze the geometrical effect on the breather waves (AB and RWs). So, the initial solution at initial time τ_{0} is assumed to be [34]
where 2L is the length of the plasma system.
With respect to the boundary conditions, the following Dirichlet boundary conditions are used:
To allow a numerical solution of Eq. (5), the breather (AB and RWs) solutions are assumed to satisfy the periodic boundary conditions in the interval [–L, L], i.e., φ(−L,τ)=φ(L,τ)⇒f(τ)=g(τ), and the time domain is |τ|=]0,T], i.e., 0<|τ|≤T. It should be mentioned here that due to the presence of time (τ) in the denominator of Eq. (5), so, the null value of time, i.e., τ = 0 is rejected from our calculations. One can see from Eq. (5) that the geometrical effect (ν/2τ)φ is dominant for lower values of |τ|, but as time goes on, the nonlinear structures will damp. Figures 3 and 4 exhibit the geometrical effect on the RWs and AB profiles, respectively. It is noted that the amplitudes of cylindrical RWs and AB are larger than those of the 1D planar pulses but smaller than those of the spherical ones. This means that the spherical breathers suck more energy from background (carrier waves) larger than the cylindrical ones, which causes high amplitude pulses. It is worthwhile to remark that the cylindrical pulses travel slower than the spherical ones but faster than its planar counterpart. Furthermore, it is found that, as the value of |τ| decreases, the amplitude of these pulses grows. We would like to remark here that Castro et_al [24] noticed that the observed waves show damping times of order of a few oscillation periods, which is faster than that predicted for Landau damping. As a result, we expect that this behavior is attributed to the geometrical divergence of the wave due to the finite dimension of the used excitation grid.
V. CONCLUSION
In this work, the MI of the IAWs in the cylindrical and spherical geometries and the associated breathers (RWs and AB) in UNPs are investigated. For this purpose, a modified (cylindrical and spherical) NLSE is derived using the derivative expansion method for describing the slow modulation of the IAWs in cylindrical and spherical geometries. Due to the impossibility of the RW and AB analytical solutions of the modified NLSE, we solved it numerically using the finite difference scheme. During the numerical solutions, the one-dimensional planar solutions of the RWs and AB are used as initial solutions, in addition to the Dirichlet boundary conditions. The time evolution of the cylindrical and spherical ion-acoustic RWs and AB significantly differs from the planar case, and as time goes on, the amplitudes of the cylindrical and spherical RWs and AB decrease. Moreover, it is observed that the amplitude of the cylindrical breathers (RWs and AB) is smaller than that of the spherical one, but larger than that of the planar counterpart. The values of the physical parameters that were used in our study are inspired from experimental and theoretical data [24,40], thus, we hope that the present study may help us to understand the nonlinear dynamics and outstanding features of the cylindrical and spherical ion-acoustic breathers in UNPs. Furthermore, the impact of an external magnetic field [41,42] on the cylindrical and spherical ion-acoustic breathers is a very interesting problem, but beyond the scope of the present work.
