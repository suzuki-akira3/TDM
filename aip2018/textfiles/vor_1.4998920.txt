Influence of N_{2}/H_{2} and N_{2} plasma on binary III-nitride films prepared by hollow-cathode plasma-assisted atomic layer deposition
The authors reported the hollow-cathode plasma-assisted atomic layer deposition of AlN, GaN, and InN films using N_{2}-only and N_{2}/H_{2} plasma. In this study, the authors analyzed the effect of plasma gas composition on the properties of deposited binary III-nitride thin films. Toward this goal, AlN, GaN, and InN films were deposited on Si (100) substrates using N_{2}-only (50 sccm), as well as N_{2}/H_{2} (50 + 50, 50 + 25 sccm) plasma to investigate the impact of H_{2} flow. Grazing-incidence x-ray diffraction (GIXRD) patterns of AlN and GaN thin films deposited with N_{2}/H_{2} plasma remained almost unchanged when H_{2} flow decreased from 50 to 25 sccm. On the other hand, the use of N_{2} plasma without any H_{2} resulted in amorphous GaN thin films with significant carbon impurity within the bulk film. In the case of AlN, similar behavior was observed as the crystal structure is significantly altered to amorphouslike material. Thicknesses of AlN and GaN thin films increased tremendously when N_{2}-only was used as the plasma gas. Furthermore, refractive index values of both AlN and GaN films decreased upon the use of N_{2}-only plasma, which confirm the deterioration of the film quality. Structural weaknesses of GaN and AlN films deposited with N_{2}-only plasma are due to presences of carbon impurities that are trapped inside the growing film. Interestingly, the authors did not observe similar results in InN films grown with N_{2}/H_{2} plasma. For InN, GIXRD and spectroscopic ellipsometry results show that the phases of deposited films change from InN to In+InN as H_{2} content in the plasma gas is increased. On the other hand, InN films grown with N_{2}-only plasma show improved structural properties. However, significantly higher N_{2} plasma exposure times are needed to minimize the residual carbon content in deposited InN layers.
I. INTRODUCTION
AlN, GaN, and InN have attracted enormous attention due to their strong potential for applications in optoelectronic and electronic devices [1,2]. (Al, Ga, In)N alloy system with a direct band gap ranging from 0.7 to 6.1 eV allows tunable band gaps of ternary or quaternary alloy systems within specified limits for a particular application [3]. The growth of high-quality epitaxial III-nitrides (III-N) layers was achieved by using metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) which require high growth temperatures for GaN and AlN (>800 °C). However, the large thermal decomposition pressure of InN and indium-rich group III-N limits the potentials of the growth of narrow band gap III-N heterostructures to be used in spectral tunable light sources and highly efficient photovoltaic converters [4]. Nevertheless, integrations of low band gap (In-rich) group III-N alloys into wide band gap (Ga-rich) group III-N alloys are possible by applying low growth temperature. There are alternative approaches for low-temperature growth of group III-N binaries such as sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, and plasma-assisted atomic layer deposition (PA-ALD) [5–9]. As compared with other low-temperature deposition techniques, PA-ALD stand out in terms of large-area uniformity, submonolayer precision thickness control, good reproducibility, ultimate conformality, and stoichiometric control of the films [10]. PA-ALD emerges as an interesting, alternative deposition technique to grow III-N thin films and their alloys at low growth temperatures and it is compatible to grow temperature sensitive structures for the integration with existing Si nanotechnology.
There are increased number of publications focusing on the PA-ALD of III-N compounds using either metal organic or halides as metal precursors in the last decade [11–14]. On the other hand, besides the conventional NH_{3} precursor used for high-temperature III-N epitaxy, AlN, GaN, and InN films can also be grown using N_{2}/H_{2} or N_{2}-only plasma where H_{2} is the reducing agent [11–14]. If carefully tuned, N_{2}/H_{2} or N_{2}-only plasma species might allow more efficient chemical bond breaking via their high nitrogen radical densities. Recently, we reported the hollow-cathode plasma-assisted atomic layer deposition (HCPA-ALD) of crystalline AlN, GaN, and InN films using either N_{2}-only and N_{2}/H_{2} plasma [10,11,14]. This study reports the effect of plasma gas composition on the structural and optical properties of deposited binary nitride thin films. Toward this goal, AlN, GaN, and InN films were deposited on Si (100) substrates using N_{2}-only (50 sccm), as well as N_{2}/H_{2} (50 + 50, 50 + 25 sccm) plasma in order to investigate the impact of H_{2} flow. A comprehensive analysis of the optical properties, variations of the thicknesses, phonon positions, refractive indexes and band gaps by increasing H_{2} flow are discussed. Recently, spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) has been used to determine the influence of different N_{2}/H_{2} plasma flows on the optical properties of GaN and InN films grown using HCPA-ALD [11,19]. However, comprehensive SE characterization for the optical properties of GaN and InN films deposited with different N_{2}/H_{2} plasma flows has not been reported. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports on infrared optical properties of HCPA-ALD grown III-N binary layers by varying N_{2}/H_{2} plasma gas as well.
II. EXPERIMENT
A. HCPA-ALD III-nitride film deposition
III-N binary layers (AlN, GaN, InN) were grown on Si (100) using a modified Ultratech/Cambridge Fiji 200 ALD system in which quartz-based inductively coupled RF plasma source was replaced with a stainless steel hollow-cathode plasma source (Meaglow, Inc.). For comparison purposes, only N_{2}/H_{2} flows were varied while III-N binary layers were grown at 200 °C using optimized HCPA-ALD parameters [11,14]. HCPA-ALD process parameters including organometallic precursor pulse time, N_{2}/H_{2} plasma exposure time, purge time have been optimized for self-limiting depositions of (Al, Ga, In)N layers and the details have been reported elsewhere [11,14]. The (Al, Ga, In)N layers were grown at 200 °C using trimethylaluminum (TMA), trimethylgallium (TMG), and trimethylindium (TMI) as aluminum, gallium, and indium metal precursors; whereas N_{2}/H_{2} and N_{2} plasma were used as nitrogen precursors, respectively. Each ALD cycle consisted of four steps: (1) 0.06 s TMA/0.03 s TMG/0.07 s TMI (duration of metal precursors feed in all experiments), (2) 10 s Argon (Ar) purge (the chamber is purged with Ar for all III-N binary layers growth in order to remove any unreacted precursor or reaction by products), (3) 40 s (AlN, GaN)/100 s (InN) of N_{2}/H_{2} plasma exposure with 50/(0, 25, 50) sccm N_{2}/H_{2} flow rates under 300 W rf-plasma power (counter reactant nitrogen precursor pulse), and (4) 10 s Ar purge, repeated for 600/900/700 cycles in order to deposit AlN, GaN, and InN films, respectively.
B. Film characterization
In order to identify crystalline natures of (Al, Ga, In)N films, grazing-incidence x-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurements were performed with a PANalytical X'Pert PRO MRD diffractometer using Cu K_{α} radiation. GIXRD data were collected in the 2Θ range of 25°–75° with a step size of 0.1°. Incidence angle (ω) was 0.3° for GIXRD measurements. Chemical compositions of (Al, Ga, In)N films were determined by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha spectrometer with a monochromatized Al K_{α} x-ray source. For XPS survey scan from the bulk of films, etching of the (Al, Ga, In)N films was carried out in situ with a beam of Ar ions having an acceleration voltage of 1 kV. SE of (Al, Ga, In)N films were measured in the wavelength range of 200–1500 nm (200–1000 nm for GaN and AlN, 600–1500 nm for InN) at various incidence angles (65°, 70°, and 75°) and a rotating analyzer (V-VASE, J. A. Woollam Co., Inc.). Vibrational properties of all films were primarily studied by room temperature infrared spectroscopic ellipsometry (IRSE) measurements and phonon mode frequencies were obtained from line shape analysis of the dielectric function. We use measured optical phonon mode positions to gain insight about the strain and bonding in (Al, Ga, In)N films. Ellipsometric measurements were carried out in the wavelength range of 33.3–8.33 μm (300–1200 cm^{−1}) at room temperature at 70° angle of incidence using a variable J.A. Woollam IR-Vase ellipsometer.
III. OPTICAL MODELING
We will discuss in detail how to extract the optical constants of InN, GaN, and AlN layers from the ellipsometric spectra. Experimental quantities measured by ellipsometry are the angles Ψ and Δ, which are acquired over a range of wavelengths and at multiple angles of incidence. The measured visible SE spectra from a layer sample were modeled using an iterative fitting in order to determine layer thicknesses and optical constants [15]. The structural model for modeling examined samples consists of three layers on top of a Si substrate. The top layer shows surface roughnesses of (Al, Ga, In)N thin films which were modeled as a homogeneous mixture of III-N bulk layer and void layer where n = 1 + i0 for the void layer. The Bruggemann effective medium approximation (EMA model) was used to calculate the effective optical constants of this roughness layer [17]. The bottom layer is SiO_{2} that was modeled with the dielectric function given in the wvase32 analysis program [15]. The main target is the modeling of the middle (Al, Ga, In)N layers. The n and k for (Al, Ga, In)N are fit to the Gen-Osc model consisting of parameterized semiconductor oscillator (Psemi)-M0 function, which is a subset of the Herzinger–Johs Psemi function [15,16]. Fitting parameters of (Al,Ga,In)N oscillators were refined until the best fit between the experimental and stimulated spectra was achieved. However, the structural model for modeling SE spectra of InN films deposited using N_{2}/H_{2} plasma (50/25, 50/50 sccm) consists of four layers on top of Si substrate. The structural model and parameters determined from these analyses are given in Figs. 4(c) and 4(d). Film thickness values were obtained along with the optical constants n and k. Finally, optical bandgap values for different N_{2}/H_{2} plasma gas flows were calculated based on the extracted k values. The absorption coefficient, α(λ) = 4πk(λ)/λ, was calculated from the k values determined from SE. Optical band gap (E_{g}) is expressed by the following equation for direct band gap materials, which can be analytically extracted via extrapolation of the linear part of the absorption spectrum to (αhυ)^{2} = 0.
IRSE data were modeled using a four phase model: roughness layer/III-N Layer/SiO_{2} layer/Si (100) for (Al, Ga, In)N films for different flows of N_{2}/H_{2} plasma. Top surface roughness layer was modeled using EMA layer of 50% bulk and 50% void [17]. The bottom layer is SiO_{2} that was modeled with the dielectric function given in the wvase32 analysis program [15]. Anisotropic (Al, Ga, In)N dielectric functions were parameterized using optically active IR phonon modes with Lorentzian line shapes which account for transverse [A_{1}(TO), E_{1}(TO)] and longitudinal optic [A_{1}(LO), E_{1}(LO)] phonon frequencies, ω_{TO,j} and ω_{LO,}_{j}, respectively, for polarization j = “ǁ,” “⊥” to the crystal c-axis
γ_{TO}_{,j} and γ_{LO}_{,j} are the corresponding mode broadening parameters, and ε_{∞,⊥} and ε_{∞,∥} are the high-frequency limits for polarization perpendicular and parallel to the (Al, Ga, In)N c-axis. On the other hand, the structural model shown in Figs. 4(c) and 4(d) was used for modeling the IRSE spectra of InN films which were deposited using N_{2}/H_{2} plasma.
Crystalline binary (Al, Ga, In)N dielectric functions were parameterized using dielectric function given in Eq. (1). However, this dielectric function is inadequate for modeling the infrared spectra of amorphous GaN and AlN films presented in this study. We think that the electron scattering in the disordered atomic structure exceeds the scattering induced by phonons. Therefore, a possible contribution from the free carriers to the dielectric functions of the amorphous (Al, Ga)N films is taken into account using the classical Drude model

Here, ω_{p}, ε_{0}, e, N, and m_{j} represent the plasma frequency, vacuum permittivity, magnitude of the electron charge, carrier concentration, and effective mass, respectively.
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Crystalline structure and composition
GIXRD patterns of the AlN and GaN thin films deposited with N_{2}/H_{2} (50 + 50, 50 + 25 sccm) and N_{2} (50 sccm) plasma were presented by Ozgit-Akgun et_al [11] Therefore, GIXRD patterns of the InN films are the only XRD data presented in our study (Fig. 1). Ozgit-Akgun et_al have observed that GIXRD patterns of AlN and GaN thin films deposited with N_{2}/H_{2} plasma remained almost unchanged when H_{2} flow rate decreased from 50 to 25 sccm. AlN and GaN thin films were shown to be single-phase hexagonal wurtzite polycrystalline structure. On the other hand, the use of N_{2} plasma without any H_{2} resulted in amorphous GaN thin film with significant carbon and oxygen impurities within the bulk film. XPS scans detected 9.15 at. % C and 11 at. % O in the amorphous GaN thin film. In the case of AlN thin film deposited using N_{2} plasma, similar behavior was observed as the crystal structure is significantly altered to amorphouslike material due to the presence C and O impurities (8 and 54 at. %). The O concentration is much higher in the case of AlN thin film due to the oxidization of the film upon atmospheric exposure [11]. Interestingly, we did not observe similar results in InN thin films grown with N_{2}/H_{2} plasma. We found out that the addition of H_{2} plasma with N_{2} plasma yielded InN film with poor crystalline quality showing high level of C (8.33 at. %) impurity with significant voids in the film. Furthermore, XPS studies do not reveal any C impurities for InN films deposited with N_{2} (50 sccm) plasma only. GIXRD patterns of InN films deposited with different H_{2} content in the N_{2}/H_{2} plasma gas are shown in Fig. 1. As seen from those figures, InN films deposited on Si(100) substrates using N_{2} plasma [Fig. 1(a)] and N_{2}/H_{2} plasma with H_{2} flow of 25 sccm [Fig. 1(b)] retain their polycrystalline structures as single phase hexagonal InN. InN thin films deposited using N_{2}/H_{2} plasma (50 + 50 sccm) show additional crystalline structures [Fig. 1(c)]. In contrast to AlN and GaN films deposited using N_{2}/H_{2} plasma (50 + 50 sccm), phases of deposited InN films change from InN to In+InN as hydrogen content in the plasma gas is increased. The single hexagonal wurtzite InN phase can be grown using 0%–25% hydrogen content in the N_{2}/H_{2} plasma gas.
In order to understand how the indium constituent of the InN films is bonded, In 3d_{5/2} high resolution XPS (HR-XPS) spectra of InN films were analyzed for different N_{2}/H_{2} plasma flows, as shown in Fig. 2. Chemical bonding states in the InN bulk films (t_{etch} = 30 s for each InN film) were determined for the samples by the evaluation of their HR-XPS scans. Three distinct chemical states were observed for InN films, and these three subpeaks are assigned to indium oxide, indium nitride, and metallic indium. The In 3d_{5/2} HR-XPS spectra obtained from InN thin film deposited using N_{2} plasma were fitted by two subpeaks located at 444.79 and 443.92 eV, corresponding to In-O (Ref [28]) and In-N (Ref [27]) bonds, respectively. According to the previous studies, In-O was about 1.0 eV higher in binding energy compared to the binding energy of In–N bond [27,28]. Therefore, the binding energy of 444.79 eV is assigned to In-O. Upon the use H_{2} plasma, subpeak corresponding to the In–O bond disappeared, and the In 3d_{5/2} HR-XPS scan was fitted with another subpeak, which was attributed to the In–In bonding state. In 3d_{5/2} HR-XPS spectrum of InN film deposited using N_{2}/H_{2} plasma (50 + 25 sccm) was fitted using two subpeaks located at 444.30 and 443.80 eV corresponding to In–N and In–In bonding states, respectively. The In 3d_{5/2} spectrum obtained from InN film deposited using N_{2}/H_{2} plasma (50 + 50 sccm), which were again assigned to the In–N bond (443.90 eV) and In–In bond (443.36 eV). In–In bonding was observed about 0.5 eV lower in binding energy compared to the case of In–N bond. Therefore, the binding energy less than binding energy of In–N bonding is assigned to In–In bonding. Furthermore, the XPS findings of In3d_{5/2} are in line with the results obtained from the analysis of GIXRD and spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements. The existence of metallic indium in InN films deposited using N_{2}/H_{2} plasma is confirmed.
B. Optical properties
Optical properties of (Al, Ga, In) N thin films on Si, namely, the refractive index, absorption coefficient, bandgap, and optical phonon modes were determined using UV-visible and infrared spectroscopic ellipsometry. Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show variations in the refractive index (n) and extinction coefficient (k) as a function of wavelength for (Al, Ga)N thin films grown with different N_{2}/H_{2} plasma gas flows. For N_{2}/H_{2} plasma processes, the refractive index of both AlN and GaN films deposited using N_{2}/H_{2} plasma (50 + 50 sccm) found to be comparable to these of the films deposited using N_{2}/H_{2} plasma (50 + 25 sccm).
GaN films deposited with N_{2}/H_{2} plasma exhibit a refractive index value of ∼2.14 which is close to values of ∼2.1 and 2.2 reported for the polycrystalline GaN film and slightly less than epitaxial GaN film deposited by MOCVD [17]. This refractive index value of GaN film is expected for thin films which might not be completely crystalline (less dense packing) [17]. Refractive indexes of AlN films increase from 1.99 to 2.01 when the H_{2} flow increased from 25 to 50 sccm. Extracted refractive index values are in good agreement with polycrystalline AlN film refractive index values reported in literature [18]. Furthermore, a drop is seen in values of refractive index to ∼1.57 and 1.87 for AlN and GaN films, respectively, upon the use of N_{2} plasma, which indicates the deterioration of the film quality. Thicknesses of AlN films deposited with N_{2}/H_{2} (50/50 sccm), N_{2}/H_{2} (50/25 sccm), and N_{2} (50 sccm) plasma were determined to be 56.49, 56.16, and 103.87 nm, respectively. Thicknesses for GaN films deposited with N_{2}/H_{2} (50/50 sccm), N_{2}/H_{2} (50/25 sccm), and N_{2} (50 sccm) plasma are 19.44, 20.90, and 144.73 nm, respectively. Thicknesses of both AlN and GaN films follow similar behavior depending on the use of N_{2} plasma and thicknesses increased enormously. As mentioned earlier, the use of N_{2} plasma yielded high concentrations of C and O impurities in the AlN and GaN films which destroyed crystallinity. These results show that AlN and GaN PA-ALD process is very sensitive to the supply of reactive hydrogen radicals during film deposition which might be avoided at higher growth temperatures due to the decomposition of methyl ligands of precursors.
Modeling of InN films deposited with N_{2}/H_{2} plasma is quite challenging since the optical properties of these films are affected by the amount of disorder in the samples. Figures 4(c) and 4(d) summarize structural parameters determined from the SE analysis. The SE analysis yields that both three InN films have a rough over layer containing 50% voids. No metallic indium is observed in structures of InN films deposited with N_{2} plasma. Therefore, the same structural model as in AlN and GaN films was used for modeling the SE spectra of InN films deposited with N_{2} plasma. Nevertheless, a layer is described underneath the top rough surface layer which is a mixture of InN, metallic indium, and voids through Maxwell–Garnett EMA for InN films deposited with N_{2}/H_{2} plasma.
The presence of metallic indium in the films indicates that the addition of H_{2} with N_{2} limit TMI-nitrogen reaction. Values for n and k are shown in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b) as a function of wavelength for InN thin films grown with different N_{2}/H_{2} flows. Refractive index values of InN films deposited using N_{2} (50 sccm), N_{2}/H_{2} (50/25 sccm), and N_{2}/H_{2} (50/50 sccm) were found to be 2.61, 2.38, and 2.36 at 650 nm, respectively, which agree with reported values of polycrystalline InN thin films in the literature [19].
By the way, increasing the H_{2} flow rate to 50 sccm decreases the thickness of InN from 42.73 to 30.15 nm. The thickness and also refractive index values represent average values of InN films (one layer model). The thickness is highest for the InN film (42.73 nm) deposited using N_{2} plasma which also produced film with a maximum refractive index (2.61). The magnitude of refractive index is stated by densities and/or polarizabilities of ions (due to material change). Therefore, the improvement of the refractive index might be attributed to film densification as the thickness of the film is increased. On the other hand, carbon and oxygen concentrations were further increased with the introduction of H_{2} plasma which deteriorates InN film quality. According to the SE analysis, the formation of InN film deposited with N_{2}/H_{2} plasma occurred on the substrate. Consequently, phases of deposited films change to In+InN+voids. Clearly, extensive amount of carbon and oxygen impurities present in InN films deposited using N_{2}/H_{2} plasma were diffused into InN+In+voids matrix and were trapped inside this matrix.
Direct optical bandgaps of (Ga, Al, In)N films were determined from optical absorption plots shown in Fig. 5. An extrapolation is applied to the linear part of the plot (Fig. 5) and then extended to (αhυ)^{2} = 0. Optical band gap is extracted and correlated to the H_{2} flow (Fig. 5).The optical band gap of GaN film decreases from 3.67 to 3.48 eV as the H_{2} flow increased to 25 sccm. The higher optical band gap of amorphous GaN film deposited using N_{2} plasma might only be due to O and C impurities present in the film. Therefore, the decrease in the optical band gap is mainly due to the structural evolution from the amorphous to polycrystalline state as observed in our previous GIXRD measurements [11].
Furthermore, the optical band gap of GaN increases to 3.55 eV as H_{2} flow is increased from 25 to 50 sccm. Further increase in the optical band gap observed in crystalline GaN films might be attributed to the internal stress developed in the polycrystalline film and effective increase in imperfections at grain-boundary regions because concentrations of C and O impurities are similar in both GaN films deposited using N_{2}/H_{2} plasma. Optical band gap values of AlN films deposited using N_{2}/H_{2} plasma (50/0 sccm, 50/25 sccm, and 50/50 sccm) were found to be 5.43, 5.73, and 5.74 eV, respectively. Optical band gap values of AlN thin films deposited with N_{2}/H_{2} plasma agree well with values reported in the literature for polycrystalline AlN films in the range of 5.6–5.75 eV. The lower band gap value of AlN film deposited using N_{2} plasma only is an indication of disorder and impurities in the film. Observations of band gap values are in good agreement with refractive indexes of both GaN and AlN films. Both GaN and AlN films begin to form a denser structure as the band gap value approaches to the bulk value of both AlN and GaN films. The band gap calculated for InN films deposited using N_{2}/H_{2} plasma (50/0 sccm, 50/25 sccm, and 50/50 sccm) is 1.498, 1.495, and 1.415 eV, respectively. These bandgap values are much larger than the well-established value of 0.7 eV reported for high quality single crystalline InN grown by MBE [20]. Origins of higher band gaps in these films are attributed to the presence of oxygen inclusions and to the polycrystalline nature of InN films. However, SE analysis of InN films indicate that their band gap is inversely correlated with calculated refractive index. The InN films presented in this work are not as dense as bulk InN films and the band gap values obtained for InN films decrease with decreasing refractive index (insets Fig. 5). Indeed, we expect the opposite at which the refractive index increases with decreasing optical band gaps of InN films. Further the optical band gap decreases as indium inclusions embedded in InN films are increased. Indium inclusions can affect the optical properties of InN films and can lower band gap due to the Mie resonances [20].
IRSE Ψ spectra of (Al, Ga, In)N films are shown in Fig. 6. Model parameters that were allowed to vary during the IRSE data analysis are the E_{1}(TO), A_{1}(LO), and E_{1}(LO) frequency parameters. Consequently, the A_{1}(TO) phonon modes of GaN, AlN, and InN could not be found since IR beam is insensitive to A_{1}(TO) phonon mode. Therefore, A_{1}(TO) phonon frequencies of GaN, AlN, and InN determined from literature were used in the modeling of IRSE spectra as parameters are fixed (532, 614, and 447 cm^{−1}, respectively) [21]. For AlN and GaN films, features corresponding to the E_{1}(TO), A_{1}(LO), and E_{1}(LO) phonon modes are clearly observed for the deposition with N_{2}/H_{2} plasma. On the other hand, IRSE spectra analyses do not reveal any AlN and GaN phonon modes for samples deposited using N_{2} plasma. For GaN and AlN films, excellent agreement between the experimental (dashed lines) and best-fit (solid lines) data was obtained in the entire spectral range. Both GaN and AlN phonon mode frequencies determined by IRSE are consistent with those obtained previously by other deposition methods within usual variation range [21]. These values of the phonon mode frequencies derived from the fitting of the IRSE spectra are listed in Table I. E_{1}(TO), E_{1}(LO), and A_{1}(LO) phonon modes of AlN have frequency values which coincide with strain-free layer values (670.8, 890, and 912 cm^{−1}, respectively) [21]. E_{1}(TO) mode frequencies obtained for AlN films deposited with N_{2}/H_{2} plasma are less than the strain-free value indicating the biaxial compressive stress of AlN films (Table I) [22]. However, we find slight differences for A_{1}(LO) and E_{1}(LO) mode frequencies between AlN films presented in this study and the AlN relaxed layer. Frequency shifts of LO mode frequencies might be due to the existence of nitrogen vacancy point defects within AlN films. Strain-free frequencies of 558.8, 734, and 740 cm^{−1} are determined in the literature for GaN E_{1}(TO), A_{1}(LO), and E_{1}(LO) phonon modes, respectively [21]. E_{1}(TO) and A_{1}(LO) values appear slightly blue-shifted with respect to the strain-free GaN, which might be related to the presence of interface disorder or possible delocalization effects [23]. At the same time, the E_{1}(LO) mode remains at the same frequency as the bulk GaN phonon mode with the increasing H_{2} flow. In contrast to phonon modes of AlN and GaN, spectral features due to E_{1}(TO), A_{1}(LO) and E_{1}(LO) phonon modes of InN films are strongly damped and they almost vanish (see Fig. 6). Therefore, E_{1}(TO), A_{1}(LO), and E_{1}(LO) phonon mode parameters of InN films were obtained from the line-shape analysis. For strain-free InN films, frequency positions corresponding to E_{1}(TO), A_{1}(LO), and E_{1}(LO) phonon modes are reported at 476, 586, and 593 cm^{−1}, respectively [24]. Determined E_{1}(TO), A_{1}(LO) and E_{1}(LO) frequencies from the IRSE spectra of the InN films are shown in Table I, which are in good agreement with published works. InN films deposited using N_{2} (50 sccm) and N_{2}/H_{2} (50/50 sccm) plasma experience compressive strain, while InN film deposited with N_{2}/H_{2} (50/25 sccm) experiences tensile in-plane strain [25]. Here, we have related the shift of the E_{1}(TO) phonon frequency to the strain in the III-N layers. A_{1}(LO) phonon frequency shifts to lower frequencies as H_{2} flow is increased, which confirms the disorder in InN films deposited using N_{2}/H_{2} plasma. Furthermore, both A_{1}(LO) and E_{1}(LO) modes appear at slightly lower frequencies than those of bulk InN which is attributed to phonon confinement effect [26]. Phonon propagation is interrupted in an isolated grain at the boundaries and remain confined within the grain [26].
V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
GaN, AlN, and InN films were prepared utilizing HCPA-ALD at 200 °C using trimethyl metal precursors and N_{2}/H_{2} plasma. Three different values were used for the N_{2}/H_{2} plasma flow. Resulting (Ga, Al, and In)N films were evaluated as a function of hydrogen content in the N_{2}/H_{2} plasma gas. Observations can be summarized as follows:
(1) Amorphous GaN and AlN films were obtained with N_{2} flow of 50 sccm. However, phases of InN films changed from polycrystalline InN, to In+InN as H_{2} flow in the plasma was increased. Best crystalline InN films were obtained when pure nitrogen was used as the plasma gas. The behavior of InN films is different from GaN and AlN films. The use of N_{2} plasma yielded high concentration of O impurities in AlN and GaN films, whereas InN film deposited using N_{2} plasma includes low concentration of O impurities. Our results suggest that incorporation of O can easily occur in AlN and GaN at low temperature growth.
(2) In the case of InN films, the refractive index increases with decreasing hydrogen concentration in the plasma gas mixture, while in GaN and AlN films the refractive index increases with increasing H_{2} flow. Thicknesses of GaN and AlN films increased when N_{2} plasma was used. On the other hand, thicknesses of InN films decreased, but overall the thickness of InN structure increased including InN+In+voids matrix when N_{2}/H_{2} plasma was used. The analysis shows the coexistence of two types of materials when InN films were deposited using N_{2}/H_{2} plasma: InN and Indium. Amounts of active N species were not sufficient for the growth of InN using N_{2}/H_{2} plasma. Decreases in refractive indices and reduction in thicknesses could be explained with the higher C and O content and less densification in the films.
(3) Small sub-band gap absorption, present in GaN and AlN films, is effectively minimized due to increasing H_{2} flow in plasma. The optical band gap of InN films decrease with increasing H_{2} flow which might be due to the metallic indium and impurities in InN films.
(4) Frequency shifts of GaN, AlN, and InN phonon modes with respect to strain-free positions are analyzed in order to assess the strain in these films. AlN films exhibit biaxial stress and it increases as H_{2} concentration increases. Phonon frequencies change with changing H_{2} flow in the GaN films as a result of in-plane strain in the film. In contrast to GaN and AlN, there is no direct correlation between frequency shifts of E_{1}(TO) modes of InN films and H_{2} flow.
In conclusion, we showed that the AlN and GaN films deposited in the presence of H_{2} plasma contained few contamination of oxygen, whereas AlN and GaN films deposited using N_{2} plasma contained high concentration of O and C impurities. Therefore, for realization of GaN and AlN films by using plasma assisted ALD method, N_{2}/H_{2} plasma gas should be preferable and it should be at the optimal condition. On the other hand, InN films deposited in the presence of H_{2} in the plasma exhibited reduced crystalline quality and high concentrations of O and C impurities were incorporated in the deposited film. These results are key issues to understand and establish depositions of indium rich group III-nitride alloys at low temperatures using PA-ALD since the H_{2} concentration in the plasma gas is restricting the properties of InN films.
