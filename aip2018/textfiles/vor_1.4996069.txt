Preliminary study of a fast massive gas injection system for plasma disruption mitigation
In fusion experiments, and for future international thermonuclear experimental reactor-like fusion reactors, the mitigation of plasma disruptions is a key issue to reduce the severe damage that can be caused to the machine by high heat loads and runaway electrons. Pellet injection (PI) and massive gas injection (MGI) are present among the most promising candidate techniques to mitigate disruption effects. PI consists of injecting into the plasma solid cryogenic pellets, while MGI involves the injection of large amounts of different species of noble gases by means of a fast valve. In present day facilities, a suitable fast disruption mitigation valve (FDMV) typically must be able to deliver [Bozhenkov et_al, Rev. Sci. Instrum. 78, 033503 (2007)] about 10 bar × l of a noble gas in 10 ms (although this figure depends on the plasma stored energy). An almost unique know-how has been developed in the Special Technologies Laboratory, at ENEA Frascati, concerning high-speed cryogenic pellet injectors based on two-stage pneumatic light-gas guns [Frattolillo et_al, Rev. Sci. Instrum. 67, 1834 (1996).]. The possible use of the fast valve, integrated inside the first stage of the gun driver, as a FDMV, is proposed in this article. Preliminary laboratory tests, conducted using an existing device, demonstrate the considerable potential of this particular fast valve concept, which is actuated by a difference in pressure exerted on the opposite sides of the valve shutter. Although the equipment used in these preliminary laboratory tests was not specifically designed for this purpose, its performances (about 20 bar × l of He injected in the test volume in roughly 10.5 ms) are comparable with those of other FDMV concepts; moreover, it proved to be reliable, flexible, and repeatable, allowing an accurate control of the amount of gas released by the valve. The results of these exploratory experiments are reported and compared with other FDMV concepts.
I. INTRODUCTION
The occurrence of fast growing instabilities in tokamak plasmas can lead to disruptions. The plasmas can lose all their thermal and magnetic energies in a very short time during the thermal quench and current quench (CQ), respectively, causing severe damage to the vessel wall. These losses are a threat for the lifetime of the machine for three basic reasons:
(1) excessive localized thermal loads for the first wall (FW) to bear;
(2) large J × B force from halo currents that the FW and the vacuum vessel structures have to sustain; and
(3) runaway electrons that may be generated during CQ causing severe damage to the FW.
The above detrimental effects can be mitigated by redistributing the huge localized energy losses over a larger surface area by means of a massive fast injection of noble gases. Due to the very short time elapsing between the occurrence of a disruption event and the potential damage to the tokamak internal structures, strategies aimed at achieving an early prediction of the disruption events and a rapid decision process, as well as the fast injection of massive quantities of gas, need to be developed. Concerning the first two issues, experiments based on neural networks [1,2] have provided encouraging results, whereas, for the third one, many experiments have been conducted in the past few years on almost all large tokamaks, aimed at (1) developing and optimizing suitable technologies, (2) comparing the performance of different approaches, and (3) identifying the most appropriate species (or mixtures) to be injected.
Two methods have been suggested to rapidly inject matter into the disrupting plasma discharge, i.e., cryogenic pellet injection (PI) and fast massive gas injection (MGI). Experiments indicate that the injection of large “killer” pellets may contribute to the generation of runaway electrons [3], and therefore, “shattered pellet injection” (SPI) is preferred. MGI is also regarded as a promising method. As for the species to be injected, D_{2}, He, Ne, and Ar have been tested, either as pure gases or as mixtures (on Alcator C-Mod [4]). In present tokamaks, the amount of gas to be injected, in the characteristic time of 10 ms, is about 10 bar × l (∼2.4 × 10^{23} particles), and therefore, the development of fast disruption mitigation valves (FDMVs), capable of injecting such large quantities of gas in a very short time, is necessary.
For the international thermonuclear experimental reactor (ITER), both SPI and MGI have been proposed; for this purpose, a multiple barrel pellet injector and a FDMV, specifically designed to deliver up to 80 bar × l of gas, have been developed at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).
II. CONVENTIONAL DISRUPTION MITIGATION TECHNIQUES
A. Shattered pellet injection
Conventional SPI methods make use of pipe-gun type injectors, capable of freezing pellets, of several millimeters in size, and in situ (i.e., inside the gun barrel). Pellets are then injected into the reactor and enter the plasma soon after being shattered by the impact on a suitable target. The acceleration of the cryogenic projectiles is performed by conventional single-stage gas guns that allow launching pure D_{2} pellets at speeds up to about 900 m/s and Ne or mixed (D_{2}-Ne) pellets at velocities up to about 600 m/s. To fire pure high-Z pellets, the barrel needs to be warmed up to about the triple point of the gas species before opening the propellant valve, in order to reduce the break-away pressure. This however results in the build-up of high vapor pressure, which flows into the tokamak while the pellet is ready to be launched. To fire high-Z pellets at sufficiently cold temperatures and avoid this problem, mechanical pellet punch systems have been developed, driven by the propellant gas, that knocks and dislodges the pellet [5]. Another difficulty arises from the fact that pellet velocities are lower than the speed of sound in the propelling gas. Therefore, a significant quantity of propellant will bypass the pellet and reach the plasma first. This fact can trigger potentially deleterious magneto-hydrodynamic instabilities and is therefore highly undesirable. To prevent such an occurrence, an actively pumped gas removal system needs to be placed between the injector and the reactor port [5], increasing the distance that pellets have to travel before reaching the plasma.
B. Massive gas injection
Several models of FDMV have been developed so far and tested on many fusion devices. Most of them consist essentially of a fast valve actuated by an eddy current, allowed to flow in the valve solenoid by discharging an external capacitor bank. The J × B force so generated repels a piston rigidly connected to the valve stem, opening the valve and causing the gas, stored at a suitable pressure within a reservoir integrated in the valve body, to expand into the tokamak machine. The throughput of this particular valve design, currently in use on TEXTOR, JET, and other machines, can be enhanced by increasing the value of both voltage and capacitance of the external capacitor bank. The FDMV proposed by the ORNL team for ITER is based on a similar concept [6], using an external power supply unit, designed ad hoc to operate at voltages up to 3 kV and capacitances up to 800 μF. More recently, a FDMV concept has been tested on AUG, based on a piezoelectric stack actuator [7,8], which opens the valve when energized with a 120 VDC pulse from an external power supply.
III. INNOVATIVE APPROACHES FOR DISRUPTION MITIGATION
A. High-speed SPI
The development of high-speed cryogenic pellet injectors, based on two-stage pneumatic light-gas guns (TSGs), is being pursued at ENEA Frascati since 1984. This technique allows us to routinely launch D2 pellets at speeds in excess of 3000 m/s [9] and Ne pellets at speeds up to 1800 m/s [10], which are roughly three times the velocities achieved using a single-stage gun. Coupling a TSG with a pipe-gun cryostat of the type described in Sec. II, has the potential of getting rid of most of the problems outlined there. The propellant pressure pulses produced by even a small TSG can easily achieve values as high as several hundreds of bar (up to ∼1000 bar), with temperature peaks of several hundreds of Kelvin, and can indeed be expected to dislodge high-Z pellets with no need to prior warm up the barrel and no use of punch mechanisms as well. Moreover, the pellet speed becomes supersonic, thus preventing the propellant gas from traveling ahead of the projectile and arriving at the plasma first. Therefore, the use of a propellant gas removal system can be probably avoided, allowing the injector to be located much closer to the reactor and reducing the distance that the pellets have to travel to reach the plasma. Both the reduced path length and the injection speeds three times higher are expected to significantly reduce the time that the pellets need to reach the plasma. Experiments should be carried out to explore the effective potential of this technology, particularly in view of future large fusion devices such as ITER and DEMO. In recent disruption mitigation experiments on DIII-D [11], the SPI technique has demonstrated significant advantages compared to MGI. This letter might not work in large tokamaks with high energy density (like ITER) because the gas seems to be not able to penetrate the plasma on a short timescale. A shattered pellet injector will be soon implemented also on JET [12], with the aim of assessing the efficacy of SPI for ITER. Consequently, SPI is presently considered of primary interest for ITER and DEMO.
B. New FDMV concept
MGI may still represent, however, a simpler and cheaper alternative to SPI for present day fusion devices, which feature a significantly reduced size and energy density, compared to ITER and DEMO. Recently, the possibility of using the fast valve integrated within the first stage of a TSG driver, as a new FDMV concept, has been preliminarily investigated at ENEA Frascati.
This specific fast valve consists (Fig. 1) of a piston shutter that can slide back and forth inside its cylindrically shaped housing. With the electro-pneumatic firing valve YV102 closed, high pressure gas is injected through the inlet valve YV101. The tolerance between the diameters of the shutter and of its housing is sufficiently small to create a very high impedance under dynamic gas flow conditions, and therefore, the pressure of incoming gas, acting on the rear side of the shutter, pushes the latter in the forward direction; the shutter head is pressed against the valve seat placed downstream and closes the discharge orifice (having a diameter of about 1.42 cm). The incoming gas then flows through the narrow annular gap between the shutter and the housing and fills the whole reservoir V_{1} (∼0.325 l), until the desired filling pressure P_{1} is reached, and valve YV101 is closed. To open the fast valve, thus discharging downstream the gas stored in the reservoir V_{1}, a 24 VDC pulse of suitable length is applied to the solenoid of the firing valve YV102, which opens causing the small volume behind the shutter to be quickly discharged to the atmosphere, whereas the pressure in the reservoir V_{1} remains almost unchanged due to the tightness of the shutter inside its housing. The difference in the downstream and upstream pressures moves back the shutter, thus opening the fast valve. Neither external capacitor bank nor high-voltage power supply is needed to operate the valve.
IV. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
A preliminary experimental setup has been prepared in the ENEA laboratory, using an existing facility, with the aim of evaluating the feasibility of using this fast valve for disruption mitigation. Therefore, the objective was to check the ability of this valve to deliver 2.4 × 10^{23} particles in 10 ms.
The existing facility consists of an automated two-stage pneumatic light-gas gun, operated by means of a programmable logic controller (PLC), and a user friendly interface developed using labview. Figures 2 and 3 show the existing TSG hardware setup and a snapshot of the mimic on the screen of the personal computer used to run the labview interface, respectively. The latter allows setting all the input parameters, such as the filling pressures of both the pneumatic stages and the sequence time schedule (including the pulse length of the opening command of the firing valve YV102), as well as launching specific automated sequences or controlling the single components.
The experimental arrangement is also equipped with a piezoelectric pressure transducer PCB H113 (sensitivity, 5.5 pC/V; charge amplifier gain, 5 bar/V; and full scale, 10 V corresponding to 50 bar), located immediately downstream of the fast valve discharge orifice, and possibly used to detect the time t_{sr} at which the shutter starts moving (this transducer is to some extent sensitive to shocks and is not optimized for this purpose). A shock accelerometer (PCB 305A, full scale 10^{5} g), mounted on the rear wall of the first stage fast valve, is used to obtain the time t_{acc} at which the shutter hits the bottom of the housing, after completing its stroke (20 mm).
For these experiments, the second stage of the TSG driver has been replaced by a 25 mm id, 30 cm long, stainless steel tube (with a volume V_{T} of ∼0.15 l), connecting the first stage of the gun driver to an existing expansion volume V_{2} (∼24.5 l), already equipped with a rotary pump and a cut-off valve, as schematically shown in Fig. 4. Both the expansion volume and the connecting tube are evacuated before each shot; the pump is then excluded just before actuating the fast valve, by closing the cut-off valve. A pressure transducer (Haenni ED 510/424), placed at the downstream end of the expansion volume V_{2}, has been used to monitor the pressure rise following the fast valve operation. All signals are recorded using a four channel digital oscilloscope (Tektronix TDS5054B), triggered by the rising edge of the firing valve voltage pulse. All times are measured with respect to this trigger. The length of the firing valve pulse t_{fvd} is set on the labview user interface and monitored on the scope. Figure 5 shows a typical shot with He gas. Trace 4 represents the pressure measured in the final expansion volume as a function of time; it is initially zero until, at time t_{fp}, it starts to increase and reaches a stationary value P_{2} that provides a measure of the amount of gas delivered by the fast valve. The delay t_{fp} is referred to the instant at which the pressure in the expansion volume starts to increase. This point can indeed be more easily identified (Fig. 5) and provides an estimate of the time that the gas needs to reach the pressure transducer placed at the downstream end of the expansion volume (about 80 cm far from the fast valve orifice).
For each shot, the specific gas used (He or Ar), the filling pressure set point and the corresponding measured value P_{1}, the set point of the firing valve pulse length and its measured value t_{fvd}, the time t_{rs}, and the final steady state pressure P_{2} in the expansion volume (V_{2} + V_{T}) have been recorded. When available, also times t_{acc} and t_{fp} were measured. For each combination of setting parameters (filling gas and set points of both the filling pressure and the firing valve pulse length), a set of 25 consecutive shots have been performed, in order to gain sufficiently consolidated experimental results.
V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Initial tests with He gas
The first experiments have been carried out using He, with t_{fvd} set at 50 ms. In these initial tests, all the electro-pneumatic valves used to control the process, including the firing valve YV102, have been fed with N_{2} gas at 5 bar and energized using the 24 VDC supplied by the output board of the PLC, i.e., in the usual operational setting of the existing facility. The delay time t_{fp} has been observed to decrease with an almost logarithmic trend from a maximum of 19.4 ms with a filling pressure P_{1} of 10 bar down to 15.4 ms with a filling pressure P_{1} of 60 bar [Fig. 6(a)], with a gain of about 4 ms, indicating that it may be convenient to operate the fast valve at high pressure. A similar behavior is also observed for the shutter release delay t_{sr}, which is typically shorter than t_{fp} by less than 1 ms. The measured average delay ⟨t_{fp} − t_{sr}⟩ is indeed about 0.4 ms, while the measured average time ⟨t_{acc} – t_{sr}⟩ required in order for the shutter to complete its 20 mm stroke is about 0.9 ms. These data clearly indicate that the delay t_{sr} of the shutter release is largely responsible for the delay t_{fp} with which the He gas reaches the pressure transducer placed at the downstream end of the expansion volume. In Fig. 6(b), the measured steady state final pressure P_{2} is plotted versus the measured initial filling pressure P_{1}; as easily conceivable for an almost isothermal gas expansion (i.e., for a constant value of the product PV), the experimental points exhibit, within the investigated range, a linear behavior; the good quality of the linear fit indicates that, given the volume V_{1} of the fast valve reservoir, the amount of He delivered can be predetermined by suitably setting the filling pressure P_{1}. Finally, with a fixed He filling pressure of P_{1} = 60 bar, the length of the firing valve pulse t_{fvd} has been progressively reduced from 50 to 5 ms to investigate the effect on the amount of gas injected; Fig. 6(c) shows that for small values of t_{fvd}, the measured final pressure P_{2}, and therefore the amount of He injected, increases with the firing valve pulse length but tends to become roughly constant as t_{fvd} exceeds about 30 ms. This effect provides an additional tool to control the amount of gas delivered by the fast valve.
B. Initial tests with Ar gas
The same initial set of measurements have been repeated, after replacing He with Ar as the filling gas. With t_{fvd} set at 50 ms, the Ar filling pressure P_{1} was progressively increased from 10 up to 60 bar; a qualitatively similar behavior of t_{fp} is observed, which drops by about 4 ms with increasing P_{1}. However, for Ar, t_{fp} is about 7–8 ms larger than that in the case of He as shown in Fig. 7(a). The shutter release delay t_{sr} also seems to exhibit a trend to decrease with the filling pressure P_{1} (from about 14 ms at 30 bar, down to about 12 ms at 60 bar) although in the case of Ar, the signal provided by the PCB H113 pressure transducer is not as clearly intelligible as for He (for P_{1} ≤ 20 bar, it was not possible to estimate t_{sr} at all). This is probably due to the fact that the amplitude of the signal produced by the pressure rise following the shutter release is smaller (and perhaps slower) than that caused by mechanical shock noise. For Ar, the measured average values of ⟨t_{fp} − t_{sr}⟩ and ⟨t_{acc} – t_{sr}⟩ are about 10 and 60.5 ms, respectively, significantly longer than in the case of He. In any case, t_{sr} seems to be still responsible for more than 50% of the overall delay t_{fp}. These experimental outcomes are not so surprising, considering that argon is ten times heavier than helium. When the firing valve YV102 is opened, argon takes a much longer time than helium to be discharged to the atmosphere; the residual gas behind the shutter acts as a spring and may considerably slow down the backward movement of the shutter, which will require a much longer time to complete its stroke. Moreover, the propagation of the pressure front along the connecting tube and the expansion volume V_{2}, following the shutter release, are presumably slower in the case of Ar, due to its heavier mass. In Fig. 7(b), the measured steady state final pressure P_{2} is plotted versus the measured initial filling pressure P_{1}; as expected, the same linear behavior and the same slope of the linear fit are obtained, regardless of the gas used to fill the fast valve. Therefore, also in the case of Ar, the quantity of gas delivered by the fast valve can be controlled by suitably setting the initial filling pressure P_{1}. Finally, with a fixed Ar filling pressure of P_{1} = 60 bar, the length of the firing valve pulse t_{fvd} has been progressively reduced from 50 to 5 ms. As in the case of He, the final steady state argon pressure P_{2}, and hence the amount of gas delivered by the fast valve, increases with t_{fvd}, but this time with a more prominently logarithmic trend, which persists unchanged up to t_{fvd} = 50 ms. Therefore, also in the case of Ar, the length of the firing valve pulse can be used to control the amount of gas delivered by the fast valve, perhaps even better than that in the case of He. Figure 7(c) also shows that when Ar is used as filling gas instead of He, no shock signal is recorded by the accelerometer for t_{fvd} ≤ 8 ms, indicating that in these conditions, the shutter does no more complete its stroke and that for t_{fvd} = 5 ms, the fast valve may occasionally fail to open.
C. Attempts to improve the fast valve performance
The analysis of the above preliminary results suggests that particularly in the case of helium, the delay t_{sr} of the shutter release is responsible for a significantly large fraction of the delay t_{fp}, with which the gas is delivered by the fast valve. Consequently, all efforts have been focused on possible strategies aimed at significantly reducing t_{sr}. To anticipate the shutter release, it is necessary that the small volume behind the shutter is discharged to the atmosphere in as short time as possible, upon energizing the firing valve YV102. The latter is a normally closed electro-pneumatic valve, in which a spring loaded mechanism provides the closing force. A small single-effect pneumatic actuator fastened to the valve body and a small three-way solenoid valve placed in close proximity to the pneumatic actuator are used to open this valve. In usual operating conditions, a 24 VDC pulse is used to energize the solenoid valve; N_{2} gas at 5 bar is then injected into the cylinder of the pneumatic actuator, pushing upward a piston rigidly connected to the valve stem. When the force exerted by the N_{2} gas on the piston overcomes that exerted by the spring, the valve opens. Three simple stratagems have been identified, which contribute to increasing the rapidity with which the firing valve opens, namely:
(1) Increasing the voltage used to energize the valve solenoid;
(2) Increasing the pressure of the gas used to operate the pneumatic actuator;
(3) Feeding the pneumatic actuator with He instead of N_{2}.
To increase the voltage applied to the solenoid of the firing valve, a normally open reed relay (Meder BE24-1A74-M) has been used in combination with an external DC power supply providing an adjustable voltage up to 100 V. The 24 VDC pulse provided by the PLC output board has been used to energize the relay, which closes and delivers power to the firing valve solenoid from the external supply, preset at the desired voltage. The average delay introduced by the relay was measured to be ∼0.41 ms, which is consistent with the value declared by the manufacturer (≤0.5 ms).
The pressure of N_{2} used to feed the pneumatic actuator of the firing valve could only be raised up to 6 bar, due to limits inherent to the existing N_{2} distribution system. Replacing N_{2} with He was therefore expected to provide two main advantages: (1) helium is much lighter than N_{2}, and so, it is expected to take significantly less time to fill the actuator; (2) its pressure could be raised well above the limit of 6 bar, using a gas bottle equipped with a suitable pressure regulator.
A series of shots has been performed, with the fast valve always filled with He at 10 bar and using the relay and the external power supply to energize the solenoid of the firing valve YV102. The 24 VDC pulse length t_{fvd} was initially set at 50 ms, with the external power supply preset at 24 VDC, to retrieve the same setting of the preliminary tests with He described above. The average delay ⟨t_{fp}⟩ was measured to be about 20 ms, which is consistent with the previous result of 19.4 ms if the additional delay introduced by the relay is accounted for.
The voltage provided by the external power supply was then progressively increased up to 40 V, in steps of 4 V each. This resulted in a progressive reduction of ⟨t_{fp}⟩, down to an average value of about 17.3 ms, as shown in the upper part of Fig. 8. With all other settings unchanged, the N_{2} pressure was increased to 6 bar and a further reduction of ⟨t_{fp}⟩ by about 1 ms was observed.
At this point, N_{2} used to feed the actuator was replaced by He from a gas cylinder equipped with a pressure regulator, initially set to the same value of 6 bar, with the external power supply maintained at a preset voltage of 40 VDC. This operation resulted in a further reduction of ⟨t_{fp}⟩ by about 2.5 ms. The progressive increase of the pressure of He feeding the actuator up to 8 bar allowed us to reduce ⟨t_{fp}⟩ to about 12 ms.
Leaving these parameters unchanged, the He filling pressure of the fast valve was increased up to 60 bar, to check whether the decreasing trend of ⟨t_{fp}⟩ with the increasing filling pressure P_{1} observed in the previous experiments could be retrieved. The results are shown by the upper series of experimental points in Fig. 9; the delay t_{fp} actually decreases with the increasing filling pressure P_{1} and becomes less than 10 ms for P_{1} = 60 bar.
Increasing to 9 bar the pressure of the He feeding, the firing valve YV102, with the external power supply preset at 40 VDC, t_{fvd} = 50 ms, and the He filling pressure P_{1} set to 10 bar, allowed us to reduce ⟨t_{fp}⟩ to about 11 ms; attempts to further increase this pressure above 9 bar did not result in any significant improvement, and therefore, all successive shots have been carried out setting the He pressure feeding the firing valve at 9 bar.
Keeping all other parameters unchanged, the voltage of the external power supply was progressively increased, to explore whether there were additional margins to improve the fast valve performance. Increasing the voltage up to 60 VDC allowed us to gain about 0.5 ms, with an average delay ⟨t_{fp}⟩ of about 10.5 ms. Above this voltage, no significant variation was observed.
A final series of shots were performed with the actuator of the firing valve fed with He at 9 bar, the external power supply set at 60 VDC, and t_{fvd} = 50 ms, allowing the He fast valve filling pressure P_{1} to progressively increase from 10 bar up to 60 bar. Again, the average delay ⟨t_{fp}⟩ was observed to decrease with the increasing filling pressure P_{1}, falling from about 10.5 ms for a He filling pressure P_{1} of 10 bar down to about 8 ms for P_{1} = 60 bar. In these latest cases, a steady state final pressure P_{2} of about 625 mbar [corresponding to about 4.2 × 10^{23} particles (STP)] was established in the expansion volume V_{2}, within about 10.5 ms after the voltage pulse was applied to the firing valve YV102.
VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Laboratory tests, conducted using an existing device, demonstrated the considerable potential of a fast valve actuated by the difference in the pressure exerted on the opposite sides of the shutter, with no need of an external capacitor bank nor a high-voltage power supply. Although not specifically designed for this purpose, the fast valve used in these tests has shown the capability to deliver about 4.2 × 10^{23} He atoms within about 10.5 ms from the opening command, as measured using a pressure transducer placed 80 cm downstream of the fast valve orifice. Better performance could be presumably achieved by optimizing the design of such a device for this specific purpose. This fast valve concept also allows an accurate control of the amount of gas delivered, by suitably setting the initial filling pressure and/or selecting the length of the voltage pulse used to energize the firing valve. The best performance has been achieved by feeding the pneumatic actuator of the firing valve with He at 9 bar and energizing the coil of the corresponding three-way electrovalve with a 60 VDC pulse. The electrovalve and the pneumatic actuator are located as close to each other as possible to minimize the time required to open the firing valve. The position of the electrovalve, relative to the pneumatica actuator, is actually expected to play an important role in determining the performance of this FDMV concept. A possible concern is related to the effects that the strong variable magnetic fields near a tokamak may have on the solenoid type valves controlling the process. In particular, one could wonder what would be the effect on the overall time response of this device if the solenoid valve triggering the firing pneumatic valve should be moved at a relatively long distance away from the machine. An appropriate arrangement, with the coils surrounded by one or more μ-metal shields and rotated in such a way that their axes are orthogonal to the magnetic field lines (to minimize the magnetic flux across the coils), might however strongly reduce interference by the external magnetic field and get rid of this concern. Appropriate experiments should be carried out to address this issue. Preliminary tests using Ar instead of He as the filling gas indicate that the same amount of Ar can be delivered by this valve within a time about 7–8 ms longer than in the case of He. This result can be ascribed to the heavier mass of Ar, which takes a significantly longer time to be discharged to the atmosphere when the firing valve opens, resulting in a slower motion of the fast valve shutter. A different design of the fast valve, aimed at separating the volumes behind and in front of the shutter, thus allowing us to use different gases in these two separate chambers (i.e., He on the rear and Ar or any other gas on the front), could represent an appropriate solution to extend the performance obtained with He to other filling gas species.
