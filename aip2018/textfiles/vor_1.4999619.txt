NIMROD calculations of energetic particle driven toroidal Alfvén eigenmodes
Toroidal Alfvén eigenmodes (TAEs) are gap modes induced by the toroidicity of tokamak plasmas in the absence of continuum damping. They can be excited by energetic particles (EPs) when the EP drive exceeds other dampings, such as electron and ion Landau damping, and collisional and radiative damping. A TAE benchmark case, which was proposed by the International Tokamak Physics Activity group, is studied in this work. The numerical calculations of linear growth of TAEs driven by EPs in a circular-shaped, large aspect ratio tokamak have been performed using the Hybrid Kinetic-MHD (HK-MHD) model implemented in the NIMROD code. This HK-MHD model couples a δf particle-in-cell representation of EPs with the 3D MHD representation of the bulk plasma through moment closure for the momentum conservation equation. Both the excitation of TAEs and their transition to energetic particle modes (EPMs) have been observed. The influence of EP density, temperature, density gradient, and position of the maximum relative density gradient, on the frequency and the growth rate of TAEs are obtained, which are consistent with those from the eigen-analysis calculations, kinetic-MHD, and gyrokinetic simulations for an initial Maxwellian distribution of EPs. The relative pressure gradient of EP at the radial location of the TAE gap, which represents the drive strength of EPs, can strongly affect the growth rate of TAEs. It is demonstrated that the mode transition due to EP drive variation leads to not only the change of frequency but also the change of the mode structure. This mechanism can be helpful in understanding the nonlinear physics of TAE/EPM, such as frequency chirping.
I. INTRODUCTION
Eigenmodes of Alfvén waves can be excited by energetic particles (EPs) generated from neutral beam injection or other heating processes in tokamaks [1–4], as well as fusion produced alpha particles. In burning plasma devices [5] like ITER [6], the drive of EPs will become very strong because the velocity of alpha particle is close to be Alfvénic. In regions without strong continuum damping [7,8], Toroidal Alfvén Eigenmodes (TAEs) can be easily excited [9]. Meanwhile, the destabilized TAEs can induce the transport of EPs and degrade the confinement of burning plasmas. The interaction between TAEs and EPs in tokamak plasmas, especially the burning plasmas, has been a topic of primary interest in fusion research.
The linear theory of TAEs has been developed for various circumstances [4], including large [10,11] and small [12] aspect ratios, ideal [8] and nonideal [13,14] MHD models, and low-n [15,16] and high-n modes [8]. Here, n is the toroidal mode number. Cheng and Chance [15] solve the linear ideal MHD equations to study the low-n shear Alfvén spectra in axisymmetric plasmas and find that toroidicity can break up the continuous spectra and form a continuum gap, within which an AE can be excited. Fu and Dam [11] consider the kinetic effects of the alpha particle and the electron on TAEs in circular flux surface tokamak using the linear drift kinetic equation coupled with the ideal MHD equations. They find that the low-n TAEs can be destabilized by alpha particles. Rosenbluth and Rutherford [1] point out that the shear Alfvén wave can be destabilized by the energetic ion and develop asymptotic formulas [8] to calculate the continuum damping rate for high-n TAE in a low-beta, large-aspect-ratio, circular tokamak. Chen [10] studied the high-n TAE and KBM (Kinetic Ballooning Mode) using the ballooning mode representation of the eigenmode equation in large-aspect-ratio circular tokamak. With the nonperturbative EPs, both gap modes (TAE and KBM) and EP continuum mode (EPM) are found from the dispersion relation. Berk et_al [9] and Candy et_al [13,14] extend the TAE study to nonideal MHD regimes (finite ion Larmor radius, electron inertia, and collisions) for arbitrary mode numbers in large-aspect-ratio circular tokamaks.
The linear properties of shear Alfvén waves (SAWs), such as the excitation of TAEs, are relatively well understood [4], and the methods for identifying SAWs in experiment [17] are well developed. The competition between the energetic particle drive and different dampings [7,18–20], as well as the redistribution of EPs in phase space and the transport of EPs in real space, can cause complex behaviors of Alfvén eigenmodes [21]. More efforts are to be devoted to numerical simulations in order to understand the nonlinear effects of SAWs on bulk plasmas and the transport of energetic particles, especially the large-amplitude collective instabilities, leading to energetic particle redistributions in real and phase spaces [6].
To investigate the global and nonlinear features of TAEs driven by EPs, various numerical calculations and simulations have been performed [19,22–27]. Fu [19] investigates the kinetic damping of TAE in JET using the reduced kinetic equations and finds the continuum damping important in the edge plasma. LIGKA is a linear gyrokinetic code developed by Lauber et_al [22] to study the EP effect on MHD stability, as well as the drive and damping of TAEs. Todo et_al [23] develop and use MEGA to study TAE bursts in the plasma regimes of the TFTR tokamak. Using HMGC code, Briguglio et_al [24] study the large-amplitude, bursting Alfvén modes in JT-60U, especially the dynamics of EP in phase space. In addition, global gyrokinetic PIC codes, GTC and GYGLES, have been applied to the study of TAEs [25,26]. Besides those simulations in large aspect ratio and low β tokamak plasmas using reduced MHD models, other codes, such as M3D [28] and NIMROD [29], have been developed to study EP physics in realistic tokamak configurations based on full MHD models [30,31].
In this paper, we report on the kinetic MHD simulations of SAWs driven by fast particles in a tokamak using the hybrid kinetic-MHD (HK-MHD) model in the NIMROD code [30]. The kinetic effects of fast minority ions are included in the HK-MHD model through the addition of fast particle pressure to the momentum conservation equation, which is computed using a δf particle-in-cell (PIC) algorithm on a quadrilateral finite element grid [30,32–34]. In preparation for studying the nonlinear EP driven SAWs in realistic tokamak plasmas, we perform the linear calculations using NIMROD as the first step. This work contributes to the TAE benchmark activity proposed by the International Tokamak Physics Activity (ITPA) Energetic Particle Topical Group [35]. Both the excitation of TAEs and their transition to energetic particle modes (EPMs) have been obtained. The dependence of frequency and growth rate of TAEs on temperature and density of energetic particles is consistent with the calculations [35,36] from the eigenvalue code NOVA-K, as well as Kinetic-MHD code HMGC and the gyrokinetic code GYGLES. We also find that it is the relative EP pressure gradient at the radial location of TAE gap, which represents the drive strength of EPs, that strongly affects the growth rate of TAEs. From the calculations, the conditions for the transition of TAE to EPM are further identified.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II, we describe the HK-MHD model used in NIMROD calculations. We introduce the setup of calculations, as well as the Alfvén continuum and the energetic particles density profiles in Sec. III. In Sec. IV, the different effects of EPs on TAEs, including the temperature, density, density gradient, and position of maximum drive strength effects, are studied. The summary and discussion are given in Sec. V.
II. THE SIMULATION MODEL
The hybrid kinetic-MHD model implemented in the NIMROD code is used in our simulations. The background plasma and energetic ions are modeled using MHD equations and drift kinetic equations, respectively [30,32]. The resistive two-fluid MHD equations are solved as an initial-boundary value problem, which is discretized on a mesh of finite elements in the poloidal plane and with a finite Fourier series in the toroidal direction [29,37]. In this work, we use the following ideal MHD equations: 
where subscripts b, f denote bulk plasma and fast particles, ρ,V is fluid element density and velocity for the bulk plasma, neglecting the contribution of fast particles, p is the pressure of entire plasma, p_{b} is the pressure of bulk plasma, P_{f} is the pressure tensor of fast particles, and γ_{h} is ratio of specific heats. Other notations are all conventional.
In HK-MHD model, it is assumed that the density of fast species is much lower than that of bulk plasmas, but the fast species pressure is of the order of the bulk plasma pressure, i.e., n_{f}≪n_{b} and β_{f}∼β_{b}, and β≡2μ_{0}p/B^{2} is the ratio of thermal energy to magnetic energy. In this approximation, we neglect the contribution of energetic particles to the center of mass velocity. If we take the center of the mass velocity of energetic ions to be zero, P_{f} in the momentum equation [Eq. (2)] can be calculated from the distribution function and the velocity of energetic ions 
where m_{f}, r_{f}, and v_{f} are the mass, the spatial coordinate vector, and the velocity of fast ions.
The δf PIC method is used to solve the drift kinetic equation of energetic particles. In the limit of strong magnetic field, the drift kinetic approximation reduces the 6D phase space (r,v) to 4D (r,v_{∥},μ) with one adiabatic invariant (i.e., the first adiabatic invariant μ=12mv⊥2/B). If we substitute f_{f}=f_{f0}+δf_{f} into Eq. (7), where f_{f0} and δf_{f} are the equilibrium and the perturbed distribution function of fast particles, respectively, then P_{f} can be calculated as follows: 
where P_{f0} and δP_{f} are the equilibrium and the perturbed fast particle pressure tensor, respectively. The condition for the force balance in equilibrium is given by 
where the assumption is that the anisotropic components of fast particle pressure tensor in equilibrium are zero and the tensor P_{f0} is reduced to a scalar p_{f0}. Note that the steady state fields satisfy a scalar pressure force balance, which is based on the assumption that the form of equilibrium energetic particle distribution is isotropic in velocity space. With the solution for δf_{f}, we can calculate the pressure tensor. In the drift-kinetic approximation, the CGL-like pressure tensor can be used, δP_{f}=δp_{⊥}I+(δp_{∥}−δp_{⊥})bb, where δp_{⊥}=∫μBδf_{f}d^{3}v_{f},δp_{∥}=∫v∥2δf_{f}d^{3}v_{f}. In the implementation, I is the unit tensor, and b=B/B.
III. THE SIMULATION SETUP
In the ITPA benchmark case, the circular cross section tokamak with the major radius R_{0} = 10 m and the minor radius a = 1 m is considered [35,36]. The radial profile of safety factor is q = 1.71 + 0.16(r/a)^{4} [Fig. 1(a)], where r is the radial coordinate for flux surface. The background number densities of hydrogen ions and electrons are assumed to satisfy the quasi-neutral condition.
The uniform radial profiles for both density and temperature of the background plasma are used, where the ion density is n_{i}=2×10^{19}m^{−3}, electron and ion temperatures are T_{e}=T_{i}=1keV. The background plasma β=2μ_{0}(n_{i}T_{i}+n_{e}T_{e})/B^{2}≈0.184%. The normalized poloidal flux function ψ_{N}=ψ/ψ_{a}, where ψ_{a} is the value of poloidal flux ψ(r) at boundary r = a. The energetic particle distribution in velocity space is Maxwellian 
where m_{f}, v_{f}, and T_{f} are the mass, the velocity, and the temperature of fast ions, respectively.
A. Alfvén continuum
As shown in Fig. 1(b), the ideal MHD SAWs continuum can be obtained from the following dispersion relation [11], which is valid for the low β plasmas in the large aspect ratio limit: 
where k_{∥m}=(n−m/q)/R_{0} is the parallel wavenumber, R_{0} is the major radius, a is the minor radius, q is the safety factor, v_{A}=B/μ_{0}ρ is Alfvén velocity, ϵ=3a/2R_{0},x=r/a is the normalized radius, n is the toroidal mode number, and m is the poloidal mode number. For n = 6, toroidicity induces coupling of m = 10 and m = 11 modes, and a TAE gap is formed in the SAW spectrum at ψ_{N}=0.5 (or ψ_{N}=0.707).
B. Energetic particle density profile
The fast particle temperature T_{f} is uniform in space and the fast particle density n_{f} is given by 
where n_{0f} is the fast ion density at ψ_{N}=ψ_{N0}. The position of the maximal relative gradient |∇n_{f}|/n_{f} is chosen to be ψ_{N0}=0.5, the profile width Δ_{nf}=0.2 and the profile length L_{nf} = 0.3. As shown in Fig. 2, with the density parameter n_{0f}=7.5×10^{16}m^{−3}, the energetic particle density drops from the core to boundary. The maximum density gradient is located around the radial position ψ_{N}=0.44 (or ψ_{N}=0.66), and the maximum relative gradient |∇n_{f}|/n_{f} is located at the radial position ψ_{N} =0.5 (or ψ_{N}=0.707) where the TAE gap is formed [Fig. 1(b)].
IV. NIMROD SIMULATION RESULTS
A. Effects of energetic particle temperature
The contour plot of radial magnetic field B_{ψ} in Fig. 3(a) shows a typical TAE pattern for the base case with energetic particle density n_{0f}=7.5×10^{16}m^{−3} and temperature T_{f} = 400 keV. One can see that this structure corresponds to the coupling of m = 10 and m = 11 mode. The frequency (ω≈4.29×10^{5}rad/s) and radial location (ψ_{N}≈0.7) are located within the continuum gap predicted by the theory, as indicated in Fig. 1(b).
We vary the temperature of the energetic particle from 100 keV to 800 keV with fixed density (7.5×10^{16}m^{−3}), and calculate the frequency and growth rate of the excited unstable TAE (Fig. 4). The frequency is found to increases with temperature, whereas the growth rate increases first and then decreases. The frequencies are located in the TAE gap for all cases [Fig. 4(a)], suggesting the TAE nature of the excited modes. In Fig. 1(a) of the IAEA Fusion Energy Conference paper [36], there is ±15% range of variation around the mean value among the growth rates obtained from all codes involved in the benchmark calculations. The results from NOVA-K, HMGC, and GYGLES are located near the bottom and top of the gray area denoting the ±15% range of variation in growth rate. Thus, the results from these three codes are selected as representatives of all the benchmark calculation results spread in between. Besides, in terms of methodology, NOVA-K (an eigenvalue code) and GYGLES (a gyrokinetic PIC code) are representative of two totally different types of codes from NIMROD (Kinetic-MHD code). On the other hand, HMGC is a hybrid code, which is similar to NIMROD. The benchmark among those different codes can be more effective in identifying and verifying the same EP physics independent of models or methods.
From the GYGLES simulation results including the FLR (Finite-Larmor-Radius) effects, the TAE frequency first decreases and then increases with temperature, which is slightly different from our finding when the temperature of EPs is very low. When the EP temperature is higher, the variations of the frequency from the two codes are similar to each other. The growth rate from NIMROD simulations are consistent with the results from NOVA-K [36], GYGLES [35,36], and HMGC [36] [Fig. 4(b)], when the variations of results from different codes are considered.
The dependence of growth rate on EP temperature can be understood from the interaction between energetic particles and TAE. There is a resonant velocity of energetic particle at which the strongest interaction occurs between particles and wave because of the match between the EP and the wave phase velocities. For a fixed density of energetic particles, when the thermal velocity of EPs approaches the resonant velocity from below, the interaction becomes stronger, thus the growth rate increases. This corresponds to the initial increase of temperature of energetic particles, which is equivalent to the increase in EP pressure because of the fixed EP density. When the EP temperature, hence the EP pressure further increases, the thermal velocity of EPs surpasses the resonant velocity and the resonant interaction becomes weaker, which leads to the decrease in growth rate. For this reason, the growth rate first increases and then decreases with the EP pressure, as shown in simulation results [Fig. 4(b)].
We further investigate the effect of EP temperature with the EP pressure, hence β_{f} is fixed. For the base case, the EP density n_{0f}=7.5×10^{16}m^{−3} and temperature T_{f}=400keV,β_{f}=0.134%, and the background plasma β_{0} = 0.18%. Keeping β_{f} constant, it can be found that in Fig. 5, with the increase in EP temperature, the frequency increases first and then decreases. When the temperature is relatively small, and the density is relatively big, the mode frequency is below the gap and it is EPM. As the temperature increases and the density decreases, the frequency increases to be located in the gap and the mode changes from EPM to TAE. That is, there is a threshold (1.5 × 10^{17} m^{−3}) for EP density, above which EPM can be excited even though the EP temperature is relatively small. Except when the EP temperature is close to zero, the variations of frequencies from NIMROD and GYGLES simulations are similar. The growth rate increases first and then decreases, and around T_{f}=200keV it reaches the maximum. The dispersion relation in tokamak with inhomogeneous magnetic field can be approximated as ω(r)=k_{∥}(r)V_{A}(r), which shows that the shear Alfvén waves with a radial extent are dispersive due to different phase velocities. Considering the magnetic curvature, the dispersion relation can be revised to ω(r)−k_{∥}(r)v_{∥}(r)−k_{⊥}(r)V_{di}(r)=0, where V_{di} is the ion magnetic drift velocity [1]. The drift velocity term reduces effectively the eigenmode frequency so that the EP particles are able to resonate at the speed v = V_{A}/3. As the Alfvén velocity V_{A} (B/μ_{0}ρ) at the radial location of the gap (≈10.7 m) is 1.369 × 10^{7} m/s, the corresponding resonant temperature of the energetic particle is 217 keV, which is consistent with the location of maximum growth rate.
B. Effects of energetic particle density
As shown in Fig. 6, for the fixed temperature of the energetic particle, both the frequency and the growth rate increase with density. Comparing the simulation results from the NIMROD code with ZLR effect and the GYGLES code with FLR effects, one finds that the FLR effect only weakly enhances the frequency and suppresses the growth rate of the EP-driven TAE. When the density is relatively small, the frequency is located in the TAE gap, but when the density increases to a certain value (1.0 × 10^{17} m^{−3}), the frequency becomes higher above the upper value of gap so that TAE will transform into EPM. For the energetic particle density n_{0f}=1.0×10^{16}m^{−3} and the temperature T_{f}=200keV, the β ratio of energetic particles to bulk plasma β_{f}/β_{0} is 0.1. As the EP density increases to 1.0×10^{17}m^{−3}, β_{f} approaches β_{0}. This is the threshold value of the energetic particle density above which the TAE-EPM transition occurs. If the energetic particle density continues to increase, the mode frequency increases further beyond the gap to an even larger value. That suggests the EPM can be excited when the energetic particle β_{f} becomes larger than the bulk plasma β.
The TAE-EPM transition can be also observed from the changes in the dominant mode structure in poloidal plane (Fig. 3). When the EP density is 7.5×10^{16}m^{−3}, the TAE is located at a relatively narrow region around ψ_{N}=0.707 between ψ_{N}=0.6 and ψ_{N}=0.8 [Fig. 3(a)]. When the EP density increases to 8.0×10^{17}m^{−3}, the EPM mode structure expands to a wider region around ψ_{N}=0.707 from ψ_{N}=0.45 to ψ_{N}=0.85 [Fig. 3(b)].
C. Effects of energetic particle density gradient
In order to investigate the effect of energetic particle density gradient, we vary the parameter L_{nf} used to specify the EP density profile in Eq. (13). In the base case, EP density parameter n_{0f}=1.5×10^{17}m^{−3} and temperature T_{f}=200 keV are selected where the growth rate is relatively large (Fig. 5). Simulations indicate that the growth rate is nearly proportional to the absolute value of relative density gradient |∇n_{f}|/n_{f} at the location of TAE gap ψ_{N}=0.5 [Fig. 7(b)]. The frequency first decreases and then increases with the density gradient and it remains located within the TAE gap for most cases [Fig. 7(a)]. Meanwhile, the growth rate increases monotonically. In contrast, the increase of the energetic particle density gradient does not affect the dominant mode feature, even as the mode nature transits from TAE towards EPM.
D. Radial location of maximum EP drive
The strength of the energetic particle drive depends on the radial location of the maximum relative pressure gradient [38]. In order to investigate the effect of the energetic particle density gradient, we vary the parameter ψ_{N}_{0} in the EP density profile function in Eq. (13), which represents the location of the maximum relative pressure gradient. The EP density parameter n_{0f}=7.5×10^{16}m^{−3} and the temperature T_{f} = 400 keV are fixed. Both the frequency and the growth rate first increase and then decrease with ψ_{N}_{0}, and they reach the maximums at ψ_{N}_{0} = 0.5 (Fig. 8). One can see that the absolute value of relative density gradient |∇n_{f}|/n_{f} at the location of TAE gap ψ_{N} = 0.5 has a positive correlation to the growth rate and reaches the maximum value at ψ_{N}_{0} = 0.5 too [Fig. 8(b)]. In the case ψ_{N}_{0} = 0.5, the maximum relative density gradient collocates with the location where the n = 10 and n = 11 modes interact to form the TAE gap. That is, for the uniform temperature, when the radial location of the maximum relative density and the TAE gap overlap with each other, the EP drive becomes maximal. This result is consistent with the conclusion from the previous GTC simulation studies on the DIII-D tokamak [38] that the TAE appears in the radial location where the relative pressure gradient of EPs is the strongest.
V. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
NIMROD simulations of the SAWs excited by the energetic particles in a circularly shaped tokamak have been presented. The dependence of both the frequency and the growth rate on the energetic particle parameters are studied, and the NIMROD results are consistent with those from NOVA-K [36], HMGC [36], and GYGLES [35,36]. In addition to the contribution of NIMROD code to the ITPA-EP TAE benchmark case, we also report on the following new physics insights.
We confirm the dependence of TAE growth rate on the relative pressure gradient of EP based on our NIMROD calculations. For the resonant thermal velocity (v_{A}/3) of energetic particles, the interaction between SAWs and EPs is the strongest. The density gradient at the radial location of TAE gap can strongly affect the growth rate of TAE, though not its frequency. The EP drive becomes the strongest when the maximum relative pressure gradient of EP is located at the radial position of TAE gap. The previous study shows that the TAE tends to locate radially around the region where the EP pressure gradient is maximum (see Ref [38], for example) based on DIIID experiment and gyrokinetic PIC simulation, which is one of the critical issues related to the EP physics. Based on the kinetic-MHD model in NIMROD, which is quite different from the previous gyrokinetic PIC simulation in terms of methodology, our simulation results reported in this manuscript further confirm the direct relation between EP pressure gradient and TAE growth rate (Figs. 7 and 8).
When the β value of the energetic particles (i.e., β_{f}) becomes larger than that of the bulk plasma (i.e., β_{0}), or when the EP density exceeds a certain threshold with a relatively lower temperature, the TAEs can transit to EPMs. We find that the increase of the EP drive alone can directly change the mode frequency and structure of TAE to those of EPM. It is demonstrated that the mode transition due to the EP drive variation leads to not only the change of frequency [Fig. 1(b)] but also the change of mode structure (Fig. 3). This mechanism can be helpful in understanding the nonlinear physics of TAE/EPM, such as frequency chirping.
So far, the FLR effect is not considered in our simulation. In the future, the FLR and FOW (Finite-Orbit-Width) effects can be included and examined. In addition, for tokamak experiments, the strong interaction of EPs with background plasma may better be modeled with the slowing-down distribution function. To study the EP driven TAEs and EPMs in realistic tokamak experiments, the slowing-down distribution function or the distributions obtained directly from experiments for EPs will be considered in our future simulation work.
