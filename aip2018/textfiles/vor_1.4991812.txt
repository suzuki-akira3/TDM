Low temperature fabrication of Cu_{x}O thin-film transistors and investigation on the origin of low field effect mobility
Cuprous (Cu_{2}O) and cupric (CuO) oxide thin films have been deposited by radio frequency magnetron sputtering with two different oxygen partial pressures. The as-deposited copper oxide films were subjected to post-annealing at 300 °C for 30 min to improve the microstructural, morphological, and optical properties of thin films. Optical absorption studies revealed the existence of a large number of subgap states inside CuO films than Cu_{2}O films. Cu_{2}O and CuO thin film transistors (TFTs) were fabricated in an inverted staggered structure by using a post-annealed channel layer. The field effect mobility values of Cu_{2}O and CuO TFTs were 5.20 × 10^{−4} cm^{2} V^{−1 }s^{−1} and 2.33 × 10^{−4} cm^{2} V^{−1 }s^{−1}, respectively. The poor values of subthreshold swing, threshold voltage, and field effect mobility of the TFTs were due to the charge trap density at the copper oxide/dielectric interface as well as defect induced trap states originated from the oxygen vacancies inside the bulk copper oxide. In order to study the distribution of the trap states in the Cu_{2}O and CuO active layer, the temperature dependent transfer characteristics of transistors in the temperature range between 310 K and 340 K were studied. The observed subgap states were found to be decreasing exponentially inside the bandgap, with CuO TFT showing higher subgap states than Cu_{2}O TFT. The high-density hole trap states in the CuO channel are one of the plausible reasons for the lower mobility in CuO TFT than in Cu_{2}O TFT. The origin of these subgap states was attributed to the impurities or oxygen vacancies present in the CuO channel layer.
I. INTRODUCTION
Recently, oxide semiconductor thin-film transistors (TFTs) gained considerable interest due to their excellent electrical performance, environmental stability, and high optical transparency in the visible range [1]. High-performance p-type oxides TFTs have the potential to realize low power-consumption electronic circuits such as complementary circuits [2,3]. Nevertheless, only a few studies have reported on good performance p-type TFTs compared to high performance n-type TFTs [4]. The most promising candidates to work as channel materials for p-type oxide TFTs are Cu_{2}O, CuO, and SnO [5]. Among them, Cu_{2}O and CuO are well-known p-type semiconductors, and they have direct bandgaps of 2.1 eV–2.6 eV and 1.3 eV–2.1 eV, respectively [6]. The hall mobilities of all reported copper oxide films were found to be higher than field effect mobility derived from the TFT measurements. Defects and impurities present in copper oxide channel layers create a large number of hole traps, and consequently, the field effect mobility decreases [7]. In this work, we investigate the origin of the low field effect mobility by estimating the defect induced subgap density of states (DOS) in fabricated copper oxide TFTs based on the optical absorption studies and temperature dependence of the drain currents. Electronic trap states in copper oxide semiconductors rigorously affect the performance of such devices; therefore, the understanding of such defect states is important to enhance the device parameters. For instance, in TFT, the key device parameters, such as field effect mobility, threshold voltage, subthreshold swing, and electrical and environmental stabilities, are significantly affected by trap states inside the semiconductor. Analysing the nature of the trap states inside novel materials can help in the better and accurate prediction of their optical and electrical properties.
II. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
Copper oxide thin films having 200 nm thicknesses were deposited by the radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering technique. Thicknesses of the films were controlled by adjusting the deposition time, and depending on the oxygen partial pressure inside the deposition chamber, Cu_{2}O and CuO thin films were obtained. The electrical and optical properties of copper oxide thin films were found to be strongly affected by even the slight variations in the deposition conditions, and hence, post-annealing was observed to be very important for optimizing the film properties [8]. All the as-deposited copper oxide films were subjected to post-annealing at 300 °C for 30 min to improve the microstructural, optical, and electrical parameters. After optimization of the growth conditions of Cu_{2}O and CuO thin films, TFTs were fabricated in an inverted staggered structure, where a heavily doped n-type silicon wafer was used as the substrate and the gate electrode. A 100 nm thermally grown silicon dioxide layer served as the gate insulator. Active layers of Cu_{2}O and CuO thin films having a thickness of 15 nm were deposited over the gate insulator. A base pressure of 7 × 10^{−6} mbar and a working pressure of 5 × 10^{−3} mbar were maintained for all the depositions. The RF power applied to the metallic copper target of 2 in. diameter (99.99% pure) was 50 W, and the substrate was kept at room temperature during deposition. The controlled atmosphere of oxygen and argon in the deposition chamber favoured the formation of Cu_{2}O and CuO phases. A gas (Ar + O_{2}) mixing ratio of Ar/O_{2} = 20/1.3 (sccm/sccm) and Ar/O_{2} = 20/3 (sccm/sccm) was used for preparing Cu_{2}O and CuO thin films, respectively. Using shadow mask, Au (100 nm) source-drain contacts were deposited on a channel layer which has the channel length and width of 65 and 1000 μm, respectively.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Characterisation of copper oxide thin films
Figure 1(a) shows the x-ray diffraction patterns of as-deposited Cu_{2}O and CuO thin films (RT Cu_{2}O and RT CuO). Thin films deposited at O_{2} = 1.3 sccm and O_{2} = 3 sccm showed XRD peaks corresponding to Cu_{2}O with orientation along (111) and (200) and CuO with orientation along (002) planes, respectively. This indicates that at lower oxygen partial pressure, copper was in the Cu^{1+} oxidation state (Cu_{2}O), and on increasing the oxygen partial pressure, Cu^{1+} was oxidised to Cu^{2+} (CuO). Further, as-deposited copper oxide films were post-annealed at 300 °C in air for 30 min, to improve the crystallinity. Figure 1(b) shows the x-ray diffraction patterns of 300 °C annealed Cu_{2}O and CuO thin films (300 Cu_{2}O and 300 CuO). The average crystallite size of the films was calculated using the Scherrer equation. The average crystallite sizes of RT CuO, RT Cu_{2}O, 300 CuO, and 300 Cu_{2}O films were found to be 8, 9, 10, and 11 nm, respectively. The observed XRD peak intensities are moderately higher than those of as-deposited films, which confirms the improvement in crystallinity due to post-annealing. Even though the crystal quality of the copper oxide films was improved, the crystal phase was not affected by the post-annealing. Apart from the improvement in the crystallinity, mobility and transparency of the copper oxide films, which are crucial parameters for TFT performance, were also increased on post-annealing treatment. The fabrication processes of thin film transistors are nowadays focused on low temperature annealing because of the recent developments in flexible electronics. So, we limit the annealing temperature to a comparatively low processing temperature.
The phase purity of Cu_{2}O and CuO films was confirmed using Raman spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Raman spectroscopy is a sensitive probe for the identification of different oxides by utilising the local atomic arrangement and their vibrations in oxide materials. The room temperature Raman scattering measurements on copper oxide thin films also provide the information about the presence of even lower content of undesired phases in the samples [9]. Raman spectra of as-deposited and 300 °C post-annealed films deposited at O_{2} = 1.3 sccm and O_{2} = 3 sccm (Fig. 2) show the presence of prominent Raman peaks of Cu_{2}O and CuO films, respectively. In the case of Cu_{2}O films, the strongest peak at 219 cm^{−1} was attributed to the second order overtones 2Γ_{12}. The other two weaker peaks at 150 cm^{−1} and 628 cm^{−1} correspond to Γ_{15} oxygen vacancies (LO), and the red-allowed mode Γ_{15}^{(2)} (TO) corresponds to the phonon vibrations of Cu_{2}O [10]. The Raman spectrum of CuO thin films also shows the characteristic peaks of CuO. The Raman peak was found around 292 cm^{−1} (A_{g} mode), which is consistent with an earlier report on Raman spectra of CuO [11]. A broad peak observed in CuO samples around 590 cm^{−1} can be attributed to the convolution of the B_{2g} peak of CuO (631 cm^{−1}) with an undesired phase of Cu(OH)_{2} [12].
In order to further investigate the presence of any undesired phases, an XPS study was conducted for post-annealed samples. The XPS core level spectra of 300 °C post-annealed copper oxide thin films grown at two different oxygen pressures [Ar/O_{2} = 20/1.3 (sccm/sccm) and Ar/O_{2} = 20/3 (sccm/sccm)] are shown in Fig. 3. It can be seen that at a lower oxygen partial pressure, copper was in a Cu^{1+} oxidation state (Cu_{2}O) having 932.92 eV as the binding energy of Cu 2p_{3/2}. Upon increasing the oxygen partial pressure, the binding energy of Cu 2p_{3/2} in the films increased from 932.92 to 933.05 eV due to the oxidation of Cu^{1+} to Cu^{2+} [Fig. 3(a)]. The binding energies of O1s were observed to be 530.92 eV for the Cu_{2}O films and 529.34 eV for CuO films [Fig. 3(c)].
On de-convolution, an additional peak at 934.65 eV was observed in the XPS spectra of the post-annealed CuO thin films due to the presence of the copper hydroxide (Cu(OH)_{2}) phases on the surface of thin films [Fig. 3(b)]. These results indicated that in the post-annealed Cu_{2}O films, only one main peak of Cu^{1+} is present, but in CuO films, both Cu^{2+} and copper hydroxide (Cu(OH)_{2}) phases are observed. The adsorbed hydroxide phase present in the CuO film is a surface species, and it will affect the surface properties of the annealed sample.
The surface morphology and roughness of the thin films were examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Figure 4 illustrates two dimensional AFM images of the as-deposited and 300 °C annealed copper oxide thin films. The as-deposited thin films were composed of very fine grains and showed a very smooth surface with RMS roughnesses of 5.17 nm and 3.07 nm for Cu_{2}O and CuO thin films, respectively. The average grain size and roughness were found to increase on post-deposition annealing. The post-annealed thin films showed increased RMS roughnesses of 13.4 nm and 6.09 nm for Cu_{2}O and CuO thin films, respectively. This indicates an improvement in the crystallinity of the films, and a significant increase in the roughness suggests a decrease in the surface smoothness [13,14].
From Fig. 5(a), it can be seen that the average transmittance of all the as-deposited films is >50%, and on post-annealing, the value increased due to the improvement in the crystallinity of thin films. The bandgap values of as-deposited Cu_{2}O and CuO thin films were 2.36 eV and 1.55 eV, respectively. After post-annealing of Cu_{2}O and CuO thin films, the bandgap values were increased to 2.43 eV and 1.74 eV, respectively [Fig. 5(b)]. To gain a deeper insight into the subgap states near the bandedge, we followed Urbach's Rule wherein the optical absorption edge exhibits an exponential behavior such as ∝hv=∝_{0}exphv−E_{0}/E_{u}, especially for semiconducting and alkali halides, where E_{u} is called the Urbach energy and ∝_{0} and E_{0} are the material parameters. Generally, subgap absorption can be estimated using optical absorption techniques with a higher resolution such as Photothermal Deflection Spectroscopy (PDS) or Constant Photocurrent Method (CPM) [15]. The spectra of subgap absorption are mainly divided into two, band to tail and band to deep defect states. The latter can be estimated only using a higher resolution technique such as PDS because the photon energy involved and the absorption coefficient values are very small. But we have focused on the former, the band-tail structure, which involves a higher value of absorption coefficient, and its dependence on the deviation from the ideal crystal stoichiometry can be estimated using simple absorption/transmission spectroscopy. The plot of log α vs. hν [Fig. 5(c)] reveals the existence of subband absorption below the bandedge (tail state absorption) in the copper oxide thin films [16]. The tail states extending in the band gap are termed the Urbach tail, and the energy associated with the tail is called the Urbach energy. The smaller slope of the Urbach tail is a measure of the large amount of localized trap states available in the optical bandgap. The slopes obtained for the CuO films are smaller than those obtained for Cu_{2}O films, and this confirms the higher number of localized trap states existing in the CuO films than in the Cu_{2}O films. The tail states act as trap states for the charge carriers in thin films, obstructing the charge transport in thin films. The considerable absorptions in the subgap region of Cu_{2}O (i.e., E_{g} < 2.43 eV) and CuO (i.e., E_{g} < 1.74 eV) thin films confirm the presence of high-density subgap defect states. The subgap defect absorption is reduced on post-annealing for both Cu_{2}O and CuO films. Moreover, the overall tail state absorption of Cu_{2}O films is less than that of CuO films, which suggests the higher value of mobility in the case of Cu_{2}O thin films.
The Hall effect measurements at room temperature show that all the copper oxide thin films are p-type and the hall mobility of copper oxide films was increased on post-annealing. The electrical parameters of as-deposited and post-annealed copper oxide films are listed in Table I. The lower values of Hall mobility, observed in the present study, can be attributed to the large amount of subgap states present in the films as seen in the absorption spectra. The mobility values of the thin films were increased slightly after post-deposition annealing, and it was a direct evidence for the reduction in the subgap states [17].
B. Fabrication of a copper oxide thin film transistor
The p-type Cu_{2}O and CuO TFTs were fabricated in the inverted-staggered (top contact) structure (Fig. 6). A heavily doped n-type silicon wafer was used as the gate electrode, with 100 nm thick thermally grown silicon dioxide serving as the gate dielectric. By using a shadow mask, a patterned channel layer having a thickness of 15 nm was deposited on the silicon dioxide layer. After deposition, the channel layer was annealed at 300 °C for 30 min under ambient conditions. A shadow mask was used to deposit Au (100 nm) source-drain contacts, thereby having the channel length and width of 65 and 1000 μm, respectively.
Figure 7 shows the output characteristics of the fabricated Cu_{2}O and CuO TFTs, which display predictable electrical characteristics of p-channel thin film transistors. The hole mobilities of p-type semiconductors are generally low when compared with the electron mobilities of n-type semiconductors [8]. Because of the large number of trap states present in the channel and interface regions, the reports on high performance copper oxide TFTs are only a few [5]. The mobility values of Cu_{2}O and CuO TFTs in the present work are 5.20 × 10^{−4} cm^{2} V^{−1 }s^{−1} and 2.33 × 10^{−4} cm^{2} V^{−1 }s^{−1}, respectively. The maximum value of drain current of Cu_{2}O TFT is one order higher than that of CuO TFT at fixed gate-source and drain-source voltages. This observation in current values is in agreement with the higher mobility value of Cu_{2}O TFT than that of CuO TFT. This is due to the higher crystalline nature of Cu_{2}O films than CuO films. Also, it is evident from the AFM images that post-annealing substantially increases the roughness value of the film. The Cu_{2}O samples have a higher roughness value, indicating the improved crystallinity of Cu_{2}O films compared to CuO films. The threshold voltages for both TFTs are around 26 V, and the high value of threshold voltage suggests a larger number of trap states in the channel layer [18]. The subthreshold swings of Cu_{2}O and CuO TFTs are 4.2 and 8 V/dec, respectively. When compared to Cu_{2}O thin films, there exist a large number of subgap states in the CuO thin films as observed in the absorption spectra [Fig. 5(c)]. It could be the reason for the poor performance of CuO TFT, which leads to the large value of subthreshold swing of CuO TFT. Also, from the XPS spectra of CuO thin films, the presence of the surface states in the post-annealed samples is observed, which can also affect the overall performance of CuO TFT.
The poor value of subthreshold swing, threshold voltage, and field effect mobility of the TFT measured can be attributed to the charge trap density at the copper oxide/dielectric interface as well as traps inside the bulk copper oxide. The interfacial trap density at the semiconductor/dielectric interface N_{SS} can be calculated using the following equation [19]:
where q is the electronic charge, SS is the subthreshold swing, in V/decade, k is Boltzmann's constant, and C_{i} is the capacitance/area of the gate dielectric.
Table II shows the parameters of Cu_{2}O and CuO thin film transistors. The obtained N_{SS} values of Cu_{2}O and CuO are 1.50 × 10^{13} and 2.87 × 10^{13} cm^{−2 }eV^{−1}, respectively, and in effect, they are much higher than that observed in amorphous silicon TFTs, which is around 10^{12} cm^{−2 }eV^{−1} [19].
C. Analysis of density of states
The estimation of subgap DOS is very important and essential since it strongly affects the electrical properties of thin film transistors (TFTs). A thorough knowledge about the origin and density of these subgap levels is therefore imperative in order to put into action the preventative measures during both fabrication and operation of the device to result in an improved performance. The fundamental principles of device physics can be used for the easy determination of subgap DOS [20,21].
In this particular work, the value of DOS in the bandgap of Cu_{2}O and CuO channel layers was calculated by analyzing the temperature dependent transfer characteristics of TFTs [Figs. 8(a) and 8(b)]. The measurements were carried out in the temperature range between 310 K and 340 K. A thermally activated Arrhenius-like behavior was observed where the drain currents increased with an increase in temperature.
The current follows the relation
where σ is the conductivity of the channel, E_{A} is the activation energy, k is the Boltzmann constant, and A is a constant.
The observed positive shift of transfer characteristics with increasing temperature was due to the release of trapped carriers from the defect induced traps. The value of E_{A}, which is the energy difference between the Fermi level and the transport band edge, can be found for each gate voltage. The Arrhenius plot for each gate voltage drawn between ln I_{D} and 1000/T enables the determination of activation energy. The equation connecting E_{A} and I_{D} is
The slope of the Arrhenius plot gives the value of E_{A} for each gate voltage, and it can be plotted as a function of gate voltage [Fig. 9(a)]. In multiple trapping and the thermal release model (MTR), E_{A} is defined as the energy required to release a trapped carrier from the trap inside the semiconductor to the conduction band [22]. By this model, the density of defect induced traps can be found from the derivative of the activation energy with respect to gate voltage. A slow variation in E_{A} with gate voltage indicates a large value of DOS, whereas a fast change indicates a low value of DOS in the bandgap region of the channel material of the TFT [23,24]. For Cu_{2}O and CuO TFTs, an exponential decay of E_{A} with gate voltage was observed, which indicates a low value of DOS. The DOS [N(E)] inside the bandgap of the active layer can be written as [21]
where E is the energy measured from the valence band edge, C_{i} the capacity of the insulator per unit area, and q the elementary charge. In this work, a channel thickness (t) of 15 nm has been considered for the calculation of DOS.
Figure 9(a) shows the variation in E_{A} with gate bias voltages of Cu_{2}O and CuO TFTs. The exponential decrease in the activation energy with gate voltage was a clear indication of the quick movement of the Fermi level toward the band edge. From Fig. 9(b), the exponential region of the DOS can be assumed as a band tail of localised states induced by oxygen vacancies in the materials. As shown in Fig. 9(b), the DOS distributions of both Cu_{2}O and CuO have a value of 5 × 10^{19} cm^{−3 }eV^{−1} near the bandedge. It was observed that the subgap states exponentially decrease inside the bandgap and CuO TFT shows higher subgap states than Cu_{2}O TFT. The high-density hole trap state in the CuO channel is one of the plausible reasons for the lower mobility in CuO TFT than in Cu_{2}O TFT. A possible origin of these subgap states is the CuO impurities or oxygen vacancies present in the CuO channel layer.
IV. CONCLUSION
Transparent p-type semiconducting Cu_{2}O and CuO thin films were deposited using RF sputtering for the fabrication of thin film transistors. The phase purity of Cu_{2}O and CuO films was confirmed using XRD, Raman, and XPS data. The optical absorption studies revealed the existence of a large number of subgap states inside CuO films than in Cu_{2}O films. The post-annealed films at 300 °C for 30 min showed better properties. Hence, these films were chosen for the fabrication of TFTs. The mobility values of bottom gate structured Cu_{2}O and CuO TFTs were 5.20 × 10^{−4} cm^{2} V^{−1 }s^{−1} and 2.33 × 10^{−4} cm^{2} V^{−1 }s^{−1}, respectively. The poor values of subthreshold swing, threshold voltage, and field effect mobility of the TFTs were due to the charge trap density at the copper oxide/dielectric interface as well as defect induced trap states originated from the oxygen vacancies inside the bulk copper oxide. The obtained interfacial trap density values of Cu_{2}O and CuO are 1.50 × 10^{13} and 2.87 × 10^{13}, respectively, and in effect, they are much higher than those observed in the amorphous silicon TFTs. The defect induced subgap DOS in the fabricated copper oxide TFTs was investigated using the temperature dependence of the drain currents. The high-density hole trap states in the CuO channel were figured to be the possible reason for the lower mobility in CuO TFT than in Cu_{2}O TFT.
