Carbon footprints for the supply of electricity to a heat pump: Solar energy vs. electric grid
The carbon footprint is one of the most commonly employed environmental indicators used to evaluate the environmental impacts associated with a process or a product. The energy sector is responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than any other sector. This has raised concerns about the consequences of the high consumption of non-renewable resources and increased the search for renewable energy sources. Renewable energy sources, such as photovoltaic solar energy, enable diversification of the global energy system. In this study, a comparative environmental analysis was performed for a heat pump utilized for dehumidification and heating purposes. The carbon footprints associated with two different scenarios for the supply of electricity to a heat pump were calculated. The first scenario used electricity from the national electric grid (Brazilian electricity mix), and the second scenario used electricity from a photovoltaic solar energy system connected to the grid. Photovoltaic solar energy presented a considerable environmental advantage in comparison to the direct use of electricity from the grid, with a reduction of approximately −207.88 kg CO_{2}-eq/year. The use of cleaner energy sources, such as photovoltaic solar energy, significantly contributes to a reduction of the carbon footprint, and herein a significant potential for the mitigation of climate change was demonstrated.
I. INTRODUCTION
The scarcity of non-renewable resources and the continuous increase in the price of these fuels are broadly discussed subjects in Brazil and around the world [1]. The importance of these subjects increases as a growth in population from 7.4 to 9 billion, and a rise in energy needs of 30% is expected between 2017 and 2040 [2]. According to the Brazilian National Energy Balance for 2015, approximately 60% of the internal energy supply in Brazil consists of non-renewable energy sources, such as petroleum, natural gas, and charcoal [3]. This scenario has raised concerns about the environment and motivated efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The increase in the concentration of these gases in the atmosphere can increase the temperature of the planet, with negative consequences [4].
The concept of sustainable development was strengthened by establishing a global initiative for the preservation of natural resources. The creation of this concept, together with environmental movements, gave rise to environmental management laws and methodologies to measure the environmental impacts associated with the use of non-renewable resources [5]. In 2009, Brazil made a voluntary international commitment to reduce GHG emissions by at least 36.1% or by approximately 1.2Gt of CO_{2}-eq [4]. The measures adopted by Brazil to mitigate GHG emissions have reduced the carbon footprint in recent years, according to the Ministry of Culture, Technology and Innovation [6].
Energy conversion processes and the inefficient use of secondary energy are among the primary factors responsible for excessive GHG emissions. The use of renewable energy sources in the global energy system has been suggested to mitigate GHG emissions. For example, the use of solar energy represents 1.4% of the Brazilian power grid, a growth of 97% compared to the previous year [3]. Photovoltaic solar energy systems are one of the most promising solutions for the future and show various advantages when compared to traditional energy sources.
In a photovoltaic solar system, solar energy is converted into electricity through the effect of solar radiation on semiconductors. In Brazil, the electricity generated can be exported into the electric grid and converted into monthly credits according to resolution 482/2012 of the Brazilian Electrical Energy Regulatory Agency (ANEEL) [7].
Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is widely accepted as a validated methodology for the quantification of environmental impacts [8,9]. LCA has been applied progressively to energy systems, including photovoltaic solar systems in the Philippines [10], France [11], Korea [12], China [13], Nevada's desert USA [14], Spain [15,16], Switzerland [17], Italy [18], the Netherlands [19], and Austria [20]. However, many scientific publications do not consider LCA in the calculation of emissions associated with electricity consumption in Brazil [21].
The objective of this study was to calculate the carbon footprint associated with the electricity supplied to a heat pump utilized for dehumidification and heating purposes, by applying the LCA methodology. Two scenarios were considered herein: the first scenario uses electricity from the national electric grid (Brazilian electricity mix), and the second scenario uses a grid-tied photovoltaic solar energy system to produce electricity.
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
A. Life cycle assessment
Environmental management laws have emerged from the environmental movements and societal awareness regarding environmental preservation. In Brazil, in the mid-1980s, environmental impact evaluation instruments began to be used by companies to select the best alternative from environmental, economic, and ethical points of view. An environmental impact evaluation tracks every action from the beginning of a process, enabling identification, prediction, interpretation, and prevention of environmental impacts by people [8,9,22,23].
There are several environmental impact evaluation methods available, enabling collection, analysis, evaluation, comparison, and organization of quantitative and qualitative information for a specific action that can impact the environment [24]. One of the most-used methods, and the one that was chosen for this study, is LCA, internationally standardized by the ISO 14040 [25] and ISO 14044 [26] series and translated into Brazilian Portuguese by the Brazilian Association of Technical Standards [27,28]. LCA is directed toward interpretation of environmental data in all phases of the supply chain, which involves everything from the extraction of natural resources to production, use, and final disposal [8,9,22,23].
Four basic components are defined in the LCA methodology [25,26]: definition of the scope and objective, inventory analysis, evaluation of the impact, and interpretation. This encompasses everything from process construction, where the materials and wastes are detailed, to process assembly, which includes the entire operation such as the transport and energy until arriving at the LCA that joins waste treatment to assembly, enabling the determination and evaluation of causes of environmental impacts associated with the studied process.
The definition of the scope and objective is the stage that defines and describes the process or product, establishing the context in which the evaluation will be performed and identifying the limits and environmental effects to be reviewed for the evaluation. The inventory analysis identifies and quantifies the inputs and outputs of the system. The impact evaluation analyzes the human and ecological effects of the use of energy, water, materials, and environmental discharges identified in the inventory analysis. Finally, the interpretation stage evaluates the results from the inventory analysis. From the results of this stage, conclusions and recommendations can be made by decision makers.
The software used was SimaPro 8.2.0.0 [29], which is a highly specialized professional tool used to collect, analyze, and monitor the environmental performance of products, processes, and services. SimaPro enables modeling and analysis of the most complex and simplest LCA, according to ISO 14040 [25] and ISO 14044 [26]. The database selected to create the inventory was Ecoinvent [30], which contains data regarding the production of energy, transport, construction materials, the production of chemical products, and the production of metals, fruits, and legumes. The database consists of more than 10 000 interconnected datasets.
There are different available impact assessment methods that utilize different environmental criteria and therefore evaluate and assess different environmental aspects [24]. According to Matthews et_al [31], there is considerable evidence suggesting that manmade emissions of GHG lead to global warming or climate change. The majority of such GHG emissions come from burning fossil fuels. While there is already a pressing social demand concerning the use of energy, caring more specifically about how energy sources may affect climate change is an additional impact to consider [31]. Although GHG emissions are part of the development process of countries, the increasing current environmental conscience demands that environmental impacts are at least diminished (since they cannot be completely eliminated) [32]. GHGs are global pollutants, as increasing concentrations in the atmosphere lead to global impacts, not just in the region or specific local area where emissions occurred. The Global Warming Potential (GWP) expresses how much heat a GHG traps compared to an equivalent amount of CO_{2} within a specific time period. The Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change of the United Nations (IPCC) publishes periodic, updated assessment reports with the GWP factors used to convert GHG emissions into carbon dioxide equivalents (CO_{2–}eq) for a specific system or activity [33,34]. The method selected to calculate the carbon footprint was IPCC 2013 GWP 100y [34], which utilizes the most recent IPCC report conversion factors, over a time horizon of 100 years (default for the Kyoto protocol and for carbon footprint studies).
B. Electricity supply scenarios
According to the ISO 14040 [25] and ISO 14044 [26] recommendations, for the first stage, the definition of the objective and scope, two distinct scenarios were defined for the supply of electricity to a heat pump. The first scenario utilized electricity from the national electric grid (Brazilian electricity mix), while the second scenario employed photovoltaic solar energy. The electricity supply scenarios are depicted in Fig. 1.
Herein, the operation of the heat pump was considered to be 8 h per day, operating during 22 days per month, resulting in 2112 h per year. The power of the heat pump was 1.25 kW, with an estimated consumption of 2640 kWh/year.
Following the definition of the scenarios, the inventory was assembled using data from the Ecoinvent library [30] available in the Simapro software [29].
1. Brazilian electricity mix
The Ecoinvent database [30] contains several processes for electricity, based on different energy sources and available technologies, for different countries. The process available for the Brazilian electricity mix utilizes data from 2008. However, because of changes in the electricity mix over time, the results of Delgado and Carvalho [21] were utilized herein, which implemented adaptations in the existing database to reflect the most recent time, energy, and technological changes in the Brazilian electricity mix. The process used herein includes generation, distribution, and transformation. The power generation system considered in 2015 followed the guidelines of the Brazilian National Agency of Electrical Energy Agency [3] and is the most recent data at the moment of writing (June/2017). The percentages for electricity generation by sources in Brazil in 2015 are shown in Table I, according to public domain data published by the Brazilian Ministry of Mines and Energy [3]. These percentages include imports from Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Venezuela.
2. Photovoltaic solar energy
This scenario considered the assembly of a photovoltaic system, accounting for the quantity of material necessary for system installation. Hourly solar radiation data were obtained from the Climaticus database (meteorological institute of Brazil database) [35], where annual solar radiation was 2605.8 kWh/m^{2} for João Pessoa. The required area to satisfy the electricity demands is calculated by the following equation: 
whereE_{dem} is the estimation for annual electricity consumption (kWh), G is the estimation for annual solar radiation (kWh/m^{2}), and η_{fv} is the nominal efficiency of the photovoltaic panel.
Axitec AC-260P/156-60S solar photovoltaic panels were considered, with an efficiency conversion rate of 16%, a nominal power of 260 Wp, and an area of 1.63 m^{2} [36]. The power generated by the system (P) was calculated by the following equation: 
where NPI is the number of panels installed, A is the area of one panel, eff is the efficiency of the solar photovoltaic panel, G(t) is the solar irradiance (W/m^{2}), and f_{temp} is a loss factor due to the operational temperature of the PV panels. f_{temp} was defined in accordance with Notton et_al [37] as follows: 
where θ_{cell} is the operational temperature of the cell (°C), θ_{cell,ref} is the standard test condition temperature (°C), γ is the solar irradiance coefficient, β′ is the temperature power coefficient (°C^{−1}), G_{β} is the solar irradiance on the operating PV panels (W/m^{2}), and G_{β,ref} is the solar irradiance of standard test conditions (W/m^{2}). γ = 0.12 was defined in agreement with Evans [38], and β′ = 0.0042 °C^{−1}, as recommended by the manufacturer, along with θ_{cell,ref} = 25 °C and G_{β,ref} = 800 W/m^{2}. The operational cell temperature can be estimated as follows [39]:
where θ_{a} is the ambient temperature (°C) and NOTC is the nominal operational cell temperature (°C), defined by the manufacturer as 45 °C.
A photovoltaic system can be connected to the electric grid, being referred to as grid-tied. According to the Brazilian Electrical Energy Regulatory Agency, resolution ANEEL 482/2012 [7], self-generated electricity can be exported into the electric grid and then compensated through credits. This net metering system formalizes and grants access to the public grid for the first time. Small electricity generation systems (e.g., solar PV) can be installed in residential or commercial units, and self-generated electricity is exported into the grid. Credits are issued to the solar energy system owners for the electricity exported to the grid. More details can be found in the study by Del Carpio-Huayllas et_al [40] and BSW-Solar eclareon GmbH [41].
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Brazilian electric grid
According to Delgado and Carvalho [21], the carbon footprint associated with the consumption of an electricity of 1 kWh from the Brazilian electricity grid was 0.299 kg CO_{2}-eq. The annual carbon footprint associated with the operation of the heat pump (2640 kWh) using only grid electricity is 789.36 kg CO_{2}-eq/year.
The carbon footprint associated with the consumption of grid electricity showed a different value from that presented in the Brazilian National Energy Balance for 2015, which was 0.1396 kg CO_{2}-eq/kWh [3]. These published emissions are associated only with direct emissions; therefore, they do not include the distribution, transformation, transmission, or import contributions. There is a considerable variation in the results for GHG associated with electricity [21]. The lack of the standardized application of the same methodology in the modeling of each inventory and the choice of the environmental impact evaluation method can be cited as sources of this variation. Within the latter, sometimes the IPCC recommendations are followed to the letter, while sometimes CO_{2} from renewable sources are included or even additional criteria for inclusion or exclusion of GHG cause differences in the results.
B. Photovoltaic system
1. Definition
The required area to satisfy the energy demands was calculated using Eq. (1), which resulted in 11.39 m^{2}. Considering the available PV panels, seven units were necessary, totaling 1.82 kWp. In consultation with a renewable energy company, data were obtained for the equipment and material required for the photovoltaic solar installation (Table II).
2. Carbon footprint
For scenario 2, in which the photovoltaic solar panels provide the electricity for the pump, there are two contributions associated with the carbon footprint: system construction and operation. System construction includes all the equipment and maintenance necessary over its useful life, e.g., replacement of the inverter every 10 years. The carbon footprint associated with system operation considers that surplus electricity (what is not consumed/required for the heat pump) is exported to the electric grid. In this case, there is a “carbon footprint avoided” term since the electricity produced by the photovoltaic solar system will help to compensate for the carbon footprint associated with electricity consumption from the conventional electrical grid (mix). Table III shows the carbon footprint associated with the installed photovoltaic solar system.
Assuming a useful system life of 25 years, the environmental impacts associated with the photovoltaic system are 151.24 kg CO_{2}-eq/year.
The largest contribution to the environmental impact of the system is associated with the photovoltaic panels (extraction of the raw material, processing, fabrication, transportation, and final disposal). Table IV shows the percentage composition of the seven greatest contributors to the carbon footprint associated with the photovoltaic panels only.
The fabrication of the photovoltaic cell (multi-Si wafer) contributes with 75.10% of the final carbon footprint associated with the photovoltaic panels. Of this value, 60% is associated with acquisition of silicon, which corroborates the values found by Hou et_al [13], where 84% of the GHG associated with photovoltaic systems were associated with the fabrication process.
Based on the solar radiation profile and corrected conversion efficiency, and considering peak hours between 17 h and 20 h, it was possible to estimate the monthly generation of electricity by the PV system (Table V).
Accounting for the electricity produced annually by the system (3841 kWh/year), a value of 0.03937 kg CO_{2}-eq/kWh is obtained (151.24 kg CO_{2}-eq/year – 3841 kWh/year).
The photovoltaic system can produce 3841 kWh/year, but the heat pump only needs 2640 kWh. Therefore, 1201 kWh/year will be exported to the electric grid. The carbon footprint associated with operation of the heat pump by the photovoltaic system is 2640*0.03937= 103.94 kg CO_{2}-eq/year, which must be added to the avoided carbon footprint associated with exporting self-generated electricity into the electric grid.
The “carbon footprint avoided” term accounts for solar electricity exports into the electric grid, substituting for electricity consumption from the grid: 1201 (0.03937 − 0.299) = −311.82 kg CO_{2}-eq/year. The annual carbon footprint associated with the use of the photovoltaic solar system is thus 103.94 + (−311.82) = −207.88 kg CO_{2}-eq/year. Table VI compares the annual carbon footprints associated with each scenario.
From a strictly environmental point of view, when evaluating the carbon footprints associated with each energy supply scenario for the heat pump, there is a clear environmental advantage in using photovoltaic solar energy. This advantage increases even further since the photovoltaic system is grid-tied and enables exports of self-generated electricity into the electric grid.
The value obtained herein for the PV system (3781.03 kg CO_{2}-eq) is equivalent to 39.38 gCO_{2}-eq/kWh and is in accordance with existing publications: Kim et_al [12] carried out an LCA of photovoltaic systems in Korea and obtained 41.8 gCO_{2}-eq/kWh and 31.5 gCO_{2}-eq/kWh for monocrystalline and polycrystalline systems, respectively. Fthenakis et_al [10] performed an LCA of high efficiency panels (efficiency = 20.1%), compiling a detailed inventory and obtaining 138 g CO_{2}-eq/kWh for these high efficiency panels. Beylot et_al [11] performed an environmental performance analysis of large-scale photovoltaic systems, evaluating the influence of the panel support structure, and observed emissions that varied from 37.5 to 53.5 g CO_{2}-eq/kWh. Hou et_al [13] used LCA in photovoltaic systems connected to the Chinese power grid, with emissions varying from 60.1 to 87.3 g CO_{2}-eq/kWh depending on the installation method. Perez-Gallardo et_al [42] used the IMPACT 2002+ method within the SimaPro software and Ecoinvent database to show that the copper indium selenide (CIS) photovoltaic technology was the best with respect to GHG emissions.
The environmental loads calculated herein will be incorporated into an optimization model (based on Mixed Integer Linear programming), aimed at the obtainment of the optimal configuration and operation of an energy conversion and supply system, minimizing the total environmental loads. Therefore, it is very important to select an objective function that appropriately considers the key aspects related to which the system is going to be optimized. The environmental analysis carried out in this work is based on specific environmental criteria. Other Life Cycle Assessment methods focus on different environmental aspects and very likely would provide a different result.
IV. FINAL COMMENTS
In this study, the Life Cycle Assessment methodology was applied to the supply of electricity to a heat pump used to heat and dehumidify air (food drying). Two operation modes for the heat pump were analyzed: the use of electricity from the electric grid and the use of a photovoltaic solar system. With the operation scenarios established, the carbon footprint was calculated using the IPCC 2013 GWP 100y method, within software SimaPro and the Ecoinvent database.
The incorporation of photovoltaic solar panels revealed a clear potential to mitigate climate changes, with negative emissions of −207.88 kg CO_{2}-eq/year, compared to 789.36 kg CO_{2}-eq/year associated with utilization of electricity from the Brazilian electric grid.
