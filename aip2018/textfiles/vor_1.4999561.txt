Hydrogen passivation of silicon/silicon oxide interface by atomic layer deposited hafnium oxide and impact of silicon oxide underlayer
HfO_{2} synthesized by atomic layer deposition (ALD) can be used as a passivation material for photodetectors. This paper shows a significant reduction of density of interface traps at the Si/SiO_{2} interface using ALD HfO_{2}. This is explained by a chemical passivation effect due to presence of hydrogen from water used in the ALD process. Furthermore, ALD HfO_{2} layers appear negatively charged which generate an additional field effect passivation. The impact of the SiO_{2} underlayer is also discussed by comparing a chemical silicon oxide to a standard thermal silicon oxide. It is shown that chemical silicon oxide can act as a reservoir of hydrogen atoms which helps to reduce the density of defects close to the Si/SiO_{2} interface. This result demonstrates the importance of the surface preparation before the ALD of HfO_{2} in the passivation scheme. Finally, this work shows the correlation between negatively charged defects and Si–O–Hf bonds at the SiO_{2}/HfO_{2} interface. A passivation stack composed of chemical oxide permits to reach both a low density of interface traps (∼1.0 × 10^{11} cm^{−2} eV^{−1}) and a negative charge density (∼−1.0 × 10^{11} cm^{−2}). This stack provides both chemical and field effect passivation of the silicon surface.
I. INTRODUCTION
Since the end of the 2000s, back side illuminated (BSI) CMOS image sensors compete with standard sensors, i.e., front side illuminated (FSI). As in CMOS technologies, the trend is to reduce the pixel dimensions in the plane in order to increase the number of pixels per sensor. In the FSI architecture, where the photodiode is on the surface, the miniaturization increases the complexity of the optical system and reduces the number of photogenerated electrons. The BSI architecture responds to this problem by allowing a simpler optical system and above all by increasing the amount of photogenerated electrons, thanks to a bulk photodiode. This architecture requires an antireflective coating layer (ARC) at the backside interface to increase the number of absorbed photons into the photodiode. Moreover, this ARC acts as a passivation layer to reduce the dark current of electrons thermally generated at the backside of the Si/SiO_{2} interface. Thermal generation is unlikely at room temperature, but defects at the Si/SiO_{2} interface introduce energy levels into the silicon band gap and then assist the promotion of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band. These energy levels are commonly called interface traps (D_{it}) and distributed throughout the silicon band gap.
The passivation of the Si/SiO_{2} interface becomes also a key issue in other fields such as photonics devices and solar cells where interface defects act as recombination centers which limit the short-circuit current and open circuit voltage [1]. Nowadays, atomic layer deposition (ALD) appears as a promising technique for the deposition of a passivation layer. In photonic devices, the Ge/SiGe surface passivation using HfO_{2} ALD layers permits to achieve a D_{it} as low as 3 × 10^{11} eV^{−1} cm^{−2} [2]. In photovoltaics, solar cells passivated with ALD Al_{2}O_{3} permits to reach a surface recombination velocity as low as 5 cm s^{−1} on p type silicon [2]. In the last years, previous work showed that HfO_{2} ALD exhibits moderate level of surface passivation. Dingemans and Kessels reported that HfO_{2} ALD led to surface recombination velocities <30 cm s^{−1} after annealing on n-type silicon [3]. Wang et_al demonstrated interface recombination velocity as low as 76 cm s^{−1} on n-type silicon for as-grown ALD HfO_{2}, thanks to high positive charges (3.1 × 10^{12} cm^{−2}) and low D_{it} (9 × 10^{10} eV^{−1} cm^{−2}) [4]. Lin et_al found an effective surface recombination velocity (S_{eff}) of 55 cm s^{−1} on p-type silicon, thanks to high negative charges (∼10^{12} cm^{−2}) and low D_{it} (∼10^{11} eV^{−1} cm^{−2}) [5]. Recently, Cui et_al demonstrated the possibility to get high level of surface passivation using HfO_{2} deposited by ALD by obtaining surface recombination velocity as low as 9.9 cm s^{−1} after annealing on p-type silicon [6]. Finally, Cheng et_al studied different process parameters of ALD of HfO_{2} and pointed out the importance of the precleaning before the ALD step. They obtained a lifetime of 1.94 ms after annealing on sample subjected to Radio Corporation of America (RCA)1 + fluoridic acid (FA) dip + RCA2. Their work demonstrate that OH terminated surface is beneficial for surface passivation by HfO_{2} ALD [7]. In the same way, Zhang et_al reported for remote plasma-ALD HfO_{2} that O_{2} plasma pretreatment of the Si substrate effectively reduced the trap density at the Si/HfO_{2} interface, yielding a highest lifetime of 67 μs after annealing [8].
The ARC is a multilayer stack composed of SiO_{2}/HfO_{2}/Ta_{2}O_{5}. SiO_{2} is the better material to reach a low D_{it} at the Si/dielectric interface. The HfO_{2} layer is deposited using ALD and brings positive [4,8] or negative [5] charges in the stack depending on process conditions. Thanks to its transparency and a refractive index about 2, the Ta_{2}O_{5} layer can be used to reduce reflectivity. In this study we focus on the surface passivation by HfO_{2} ALD. To reduce the generation rate G_{s} at the Si/SiO_{2} interface, we use chemical and/or field effect passivation. Chemical passivation reduces the density of interface traps while field effect passivation works by introducing positive or negative charges in the ARC. In the case of n-type pixels, it is favorable to use negative charges in the passivation layer. Band bending induced by accumulation improve the collection of photo-generated electrons by the photodiode. Moreover, accumulation at the Si/SiO_{2} interface allows emptying interface traps and thus limits the electron generation. Thereby, ALD appears as a promising passivation technique for backside illuminated CMOS image sensors where low temperature processes are required due to integration's flow specification.
In the first part of this paper, we study the hydrogen passivation induced by ALD of HfO_{2} which permits to reduce the density of interface traps (D_{it}) at the Si/SiO_{2} interface. The formation of Si–H bonds is demonstrated from multiple internal reflection (MIR) measurements. In the second part, we will discuss the impact of different silicon oxide underlayer in the stack by comparing thermal silicon oxide and chemical silicon oxide. attenuated total reflection (ATR) measurements will highlight the modification of the chemical oxide induced by HfO_{2} deposition.
II. EXPERIMENT
A. Sample preparation
In this work, all samples were fabricated on whole p-type silicon 300 mm wafers (775 μm thick) of (100) orientation, doped using boron at ∼1.0 × 10^{15} cm^{−3}. Two different SiO_{2}/HfO_{2} stacks are studied. For all stacks, HfO_{2} is deposited using thermal ALD, in an ASM pulsar reactor. Precursors are HfCl_{4} and water vapor, with a deposition temperature of 300 °C. N_{2} is used as carrier and purge gas. In the first stack, the SiO_{2} layer is a 4.4 nm thick thermal silicon oxide obtained using a rapid thermal oxidation (RTO) at 1100 °C in pure oxygen ambient. In the second stack, SiO_{2} is obtained using a liquid phase HF/standard clean 1 (HFSC1). The HF permits the native oxide removal. SC1 is a mixture of ammonia (NH_{4}OH), oxygen peroxide (H_{2}O_{2}), and water at 65 °C which allows the formation of a thin (0.8 nm) and reproducible SiO_{x}H_{y} layer commonly called chemical silicon oxide.
B. Defects and charge measurements method
Since the 1980s, the Si/SiO_{2} interface has been widely studied. Several authors have discussed the origins of the D_{it} distribution in the silicon band gap. It consists of a U-shaped density of interface traps with two D_{it} peaks located roughly at 0.3 eV above the valence band and 0.25 eV below the conduction band. The continuous background D_{it} can arise from the presence of quantitative and/or topological disorder in a thin interfacial layer. Indeed, experimental studies indicate the presence of a narrow (∼2 atomic layers) disordered Si layer at the Si/SiO_{2} interface [9,10]. Johnson et_al [11] and Poindexter et_al [12] ascribe the two D_{it} peaks to dangling bonds for (111) silicon. Later, Gerardi et_al [13] find similar results on (100) silicon, leading to the conclusion that the dangling bonds are identified as the major source of D_{it.}
In this work, the density of interface traps, D_{it}, and total charge, Q_{tot}, are measured using corona oxide characterization of semiconductor (COCOS) [14–17]. Measurements are performed on 300 mm whole wafers using a FAaST™ 230 from Semiconductor Diagnostics Incorporation. The approach uses the sequential application of corona charge on an area of about 1 cm^{2} of the wafer surface followed by contact potential difference (CPD) measurements via a Kelvin probe. After every deposition of corona charge, the contact potential difference is measured in the dark and under illumination, VCPDdark and VCPDlight, respectively. Under illumination, the contact potential should be independent of the surface potential due to the generated excess charge carriers leading to flatband condition (V_{SB} = 0) independent of the deposited corona charge density. Thus, a subtraction of the contact potential under illumination from the contact potential in the dark gives the potential of the surface barrier V_{SB} as a function of the deposited corona charges. Figure 1(a) shows the potentials, VCPDdark and VCPDlight, as a function of corona charge, Q_{C}. V_{init} corresponds to the initial potential of the sample at the beginning of the COCOS measurement. V_{FB} corresponds to the flat band condition, i.e., V_{SB} = 0. The corona charge needed for the V_{SB} to reach zero (flat band condition) from its initial value represents the total charge contained in the sample, Q_{tot}. With the charge of the space charge region Q_{SC} found from the dependence of the standard space charge function (F_{S}) on V_{SB} and the charge–charge relation, the charges trapped in the interface traps Q_{it} can be obtained for every surface barrier potential. Thus, the D_{it} can be calculated as a function of the surface barrier potential V_{SB} by the following relation:
where ΔV_{SB} is the change in the surface barrier and ΔQc the change in the charges trapped in the interface traps caused by a quanta of corona charge ΔQc.
D_{it} is plotted in Fig. 1(b) as a function of V_{SB} by calculating D_{it} for the range of V_{SB} values, starting from the flat-band condition, up to weak inversion. In this paper we use the minimum of the distribution called D_{it min} to compare the different sample. The values of D_{it min} and Q_{tot} reported in this study are the average of ten measurements per sample. The error margins correspond to the minimum and maximum values obtain from this ten measurements.
C. ATR and MIR set up
To characterize Si–O and Si–H chemical bonds, both ATR (Refs [18–20]) and multiple internal reflection are used (see Fig. 2). In ATR, infrared absorption spectra are acquired between 600 and 4500 cm^{−1}. In this configuration, sample spectrum is referenced to the spectrum obtain when no sample is coupled to the prism. The sensitivity of ATR is due to the enhancement of the E_{pz} electric field component, orthogonal to the sample surface. Nevertheless, when the effective cross-section of the absorption vibrations is too low, as for Si-H, ATR is not sensitive enough to characterize a 10 nm-thin HfO_{2} layers. In this case, we use MIR setup shown in Fig. 2(b) [18,19]. The sensitivity of MIR is due to the multiple interaction of light with the sample surface (∼120 reflections in our case). Spectra are acquired in the IR transparency spectral range of the set up (1800 and 4500 cm^{−1}). A reference sample is needed to eliminate the optical bench contribution to the MIR spectrum. For this purpose, we use RTO SiO_{2} sample as it has a very low Si–H chemical bonds concentration at the Si/SiO_{2} interface and in SiO_{2} layer.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In the first part, we will study the passivation induced by HfO_{2}. We will bring out the role of hydrogen atoms from the H_{2}O used for the ALD deposition process. Moreover, we will discuss the role of SiO_{2}/HfO_{2} interface on field effect passivation. In the second part, we will discuss the impact of silicon oxide underlayer on passivation property. For this, we will compare thermal silicon oxide and chemical silicon oxide.
A. Hydrogen passivation
The first stack studied consists of a thermal silicon oxide (RTO) and a layer of HfO_{2} deposited by ALD. The impact of HfO_{2} thickness on the passivation properties is studied by measuring D_{it min} for different numbers of ALD cycles. The experimental results are plotted in Fig. 3. In this figure, the full squares indicate the initial D_{it min} values measured for each thermal oxide samples before HfO_{2} deposition. The full dots are showing the evolution of the D_{it min} values after HfO_{2} deposition.
The SiO_{2} (RTO) samples exhibit high D_{it min} values, roughly 1.3 × 10^{12} cm^{−2} eV^{−1}. This is due to the absence of annealing after the RTO process. Indeed, during the manufacturing of integrated circuits, one or more annealing in hydrogen ambient (called forming gas) allow to reduce the defect density at the Si/SiO_{2} interface. Note that after HfO_{2} deposition, error margins are better for 40 ALD cycles because the process is optimized to achieve the best uniformity within this thickness range. From Fig. 3, it is clear that HfO_{2} deposition on thermal silicon oxide induces a decrease of the D_{it min} value. This may be due to a chemical passivation effect. An hydrogenation passivation mechanism could explain this evolution. In the case of passivation by ALD of Al_{2}O_{3}, it has been reported that the hydrogen content of the deposited film is very important for the chemical passivation of c-Si for solar cells [1]. But the only hydrogen-based precursor in the ALD process is water. Therefore, in order to verify the role of water on a hydrogenation passivation mechanism, additional SiO_{2} (RTO) samples have been submitted to water pulses only from the HfO_{2} ALD process. Moreover, in order to keep constant process time and thermal budget, the HfCl_{4} pulse time has been shifted in the N_{2} purge time.
The results are plotted in Fig. 4 for two different numbers of ALD cycles. Once again, full square dots indicate the initial (reference) D_{it min} value measured for each thermal oxide. From Fig. 4, it appears that water is even more efficient than HfO_{2} for decreasing D_{it min} values (empty triangles). This decrease can originate from a chemical hydrogenation passivation mechanism involving hydrogen from water and the passivation of defects closed to the Si/SiO_{2} interface such as dangling bonds [11–13] or oxygen vacancies [21,22]. When HfCl_{4} is added to water for HfO_{2} ALD on SiO_{2} (RTO), the passivation becomes less efficient. This may be explained by a barrier/diffusion mechanism: hydrogen from water must diffuse through HfO_{2} to reach the Si/SiO_{2} interface. Thicker is the HfO_{2} layer, lower is the hydrogen flux reaching this interface. This may explain the evolution of D_{it min} values with the ALD number of cycles in Fig. 3. For very thin HfO_{2} layers, from very first cycles to approximately 60 ALD cycles, hydrogen is easily transported through the oxide and can reach the interface. The diffusion is probably not limited, and the final degree of passivation depends on the hydrogen dose, i.e., the number of ALD cycles. For thicker HfO_{2} layers, beyond 80 ALD cycles, D_{it min} value appears to saturate probably due to the presence of a thick HfO_{2} layer which limits hydrogen diffusion.
Hydrogenation mechanism can be evidenced, thanks to IR measurements. Hydrogenation of dangling bonds at the interface should indeed create Si–H bonds. Thus, samples passivated by only HfO_{2} and water are characterized using the MIR set-up described in Sec. II C. Figure 5(a) shows MIR measurements of two SiO_{2} (RTO)/HfO_{2} stacks with two HfO_{2} thicknesses (4.5 and 6.7 nm). Figure 5(b) shows MIR measurements of two SiO_{2} (RTO) samples submitted only to the number of H_{2}O pulses corresponding to 4.5 and 6.7 nm of HfO_{2}. The MIR spectra are normalized to the SiO_{2} (RTO) sample; thus, only modifications induced by the HfO_{2} deposition or H_{2}O pulses are monitored here. These measurements show the presence of Si–H bonds after HfO_{2} deposition and after H_{2}O pulses. The stretching band of Si–H bond in three different chemical environments (Si_{3}Si-H, Si_{2}Si-H_{2}, and SiSi-H_{3}) is ranging from 2080 to 2110 cm^{−1} [23,24]. This is in good agreement with a chemical passivation of dangling bonds by hydrogen atoms from H_{2}O vapor. Moreover, the lower D_{it min} value measured in the case of H_{2}O passivation only is well correlated to higher Si-H bands intensity. Several authors [25,26] propose an extended Si/SiO_{2} interface of several angstroms, up to 1 nm, which consists of a suboxide, SiO_{2-x}, x ranging from 0 to 1. This interfacial layer is known to contain defects, highlighted using electron spin resonance (ESR) measurement, called E′ centers. These defects are due to the presence of oxygen vacancies. Therefore, the stretching band of Si–H bond in the chemical environment O_{3}Si-H ranging from 2245 to 2270 cm^{−1} [23,24], could bring out the passivation of oxygen vacancies into the first angströms of the silicon oxide layer.
In Fig. 6, full dots show the evolution of the Q_{tot} values after HfO_{2} deposition as a function of ALD cycles and full square dots gives the initial Q_{tot} measured (reference) for each thermal oxide. HfO_{2} deposition on thermal silicon oxide reduces the value of Q_{tot}. However, Q_{tot} value increases slightly as a function of HfO_{2} thickness. To explain this trend, we can suggest that, during ALD process, SiO_{2}-interfacial layer (IL) scavenging explained by V_{O} diffusion across the HfO_{2}/SiO_{2} interface implies the formation of V_{O} in the SiO_{2} underlayer [27–29]. As described in Ref [30], oxygen vacancies into SiO_{2} can be positively charged. So, we can expect that the density of positively charged V_{O} in SiO_{2} increases as a function of ALD cycles.
We can keep the same approach than previously for D_{it min} and try to study the impact of water pulses on Q_{tot} values. The measured Q_{tot} values after HfO_{2} deposition (full dots) and after H_{2}O vapor pulses (empty triangles) for two numbers of ALD cycles are plotted in Fig. 7. The initial Q_{tot} values measured on thermal oxide are given as a reference for each samples (full square dots). A slight decrease in Q_{tot} values is observed when the thermal oxide is submitted to H_{2}O vapor. As mentioned earlier, a suboxide at the Si/SiO_{2} interface [26,27] contains defects (E′ centers) related to the existence of oxygen vacancies. Moreover, as described in Ref [30], oxygen vacancies into SiO_{2} can be positively charged. Therefore, we believe that the Q_{tot} values decrease observed after H_{2}O vapor pulses is due to the chemical passivation of positively charged oxygen vacancies close to the Si/SiO_{2} interface. This is supported by the presence of a Si-H stretching band in the O_{3}Si-H chemical environment ranging from 2245 to 2270 cm^{−1} [24,25], as observed Fig. 5(b). In Fig. 7, full dots show that Q_{tot} decreases more after HfO_{2} deposition than after H_{2}O vapor pulses. This indicates that the origin of Q_{tot} values modification is not limited to the chemical passivation of positively charged defects close to the Si/SiO_{2} interface. HfO_{2} deposition may also add negative charges probably localized at the SiO_{2}/HfO_{2} interface.
Similar results have been obtained from Dingemans and Kessels with Al_{2}O_{3} [1]. They also reported the presence of negative charges added by the ALD oxide deposition. Interstitial oxygen or/and aluminum vacancies can both add negative charges [1,31]. In the same way, we can propose the existence of hafnium vacancies in HfO_{2} layer close to the SiO_{2}/HfO_{2} interface. The possibility to find hafnium vacancies in HfO_{2} was already demonstrated using ESR measurements [32].
Table I shows the main results and hypothesis of the first part.
B. Chemical silicon oxide impact
The impact of SiO_{2} quality is now studied. For this purpose, two different SiO_{2}/HfO_{2} stacks are compared: one with a thermal silicon oxide (RTO) and the other with a chemical silicon oxide (HFSC1).
The chemical silicon oxide surface is composed of a large amount of hydroxyl groups, known to be favorable to the nucleation of HfO_{2} layer. After HfO_{2} deposition, lower D_{it min} values are obtained in the case of chemical silicon oxide for every HfO_{2} thickness as shown in Fig. 8. The lower D_{it min} values seem to indicate that the chemical oxide presents a better chemical passivation property than the thermal one, i.e., number of defects is probably lower in the chemical oxide. This is probably due to the large amount of hydrogen groups provided by the liquid SC1 step, which passivate dangling bonds at the Si/SiO_{2} interface, reducing the density of interface traps. In the same way, Lin et_al reported that chemical oxide is beneficial for surface passivation by HfO_{2} ALD [5].
Negative values for Q_{tot} (about −1 × 10^{11} cm^{−2}) are observed in Fig. 9 with a chemical silicon oxide, for every HfO_{2} thickness. This is probably due to different causes. First, hydrogen groups can passivate positively charged oxygen vacancies close to the Si/SiO_{2} interface. Second, the chemical silicon oxide thickness can impact the density of positively charged defects [25,26]. Therefore, the chemical silicon oxide contains probably less positively charged oxygen vacancies than the thermal silicon oxide. This helps to obtain negative values of Q_{tot} and then to improve the field effect passivation property of the stack.
The MIR spectra of a chemical silicon oxide (noted HFSC1) wafer before any passivation is displayed in Fig. 10(a). The MIR spectra of SiO_{2}/HfO_{2} stacks composed of chemical and thermal silicon oxides (noted RTO) are shown in Fig. 10(b). As we can see in Fig. 10(a), the number of Si-H bonds is higher with the chemical silicon oxide than the thermal silicon oxide (which is used as a reference here). This agrees with the assumption of a better chemical passivation of dangling bonds by hydrogen using chemical oxide, thanks to liquid SC1 step, which contains a large amount of hydrogen groups compared to the thermal oxidation wherein only O_{2} is used as an oxidant. In the same way, as shown in Fig. 10(b), samples with HfO_{2} deposited on chemical silicon oxide present much more Si–H bonds than samples with HfO_{2} deposited on thermal silicon oxide. This indicates that a large part of hydrogen species provided by the liquid SC1 step remain close to the Si/SiO_{2} interface. This result is in agreement with a better chemical passivation of dangling bonds when using a chemical silicon oxide in the SiO_{2}/HfO_{2} stacks.
Figure 11 displays ATR spectra of a chemical silicon oxide (HFSC1) and ATR spectra of SiO_{2}/HfO_{2} stacks composed of chemical silicon oxide (HFSC1) with different HfO_{2} thicknesses (2.5 to 10 nm). The intensity of Si–O bonds does not vary when increasing the number of ALD cycles. In addition, a shift toward lower wave numbers of the Si–O peak position is observed and the intensity increases between ∼1000 and ∼1125 cm^{−1} after the HfO_{2} deposition. The shift of the Si–O bond contribution can come from a degradation of SiO_{2} underlayer quality due to scavenging, i.e., the migration of oxygen atoms from SiO_{2} layer to HfO_{2} layer during the HfO_{2} deposition process [28]. The increase of the peak intensity between ∼1000 and ∼1125 cm^{−1}observed in Fig. 11, can be attributed to the formation of Hf–Si–O bonds at the SiO_{2}/HfO_{2} interface. Indeed, a broad band (1200–800 cm^{−1}) composed of multiple contributions is attributed to the amorphous Hf-O-Si structure [33]. The intensity of this broad band does not change as a function of HfO_{2} thickness. In the same way, the negative total charges do not change as a function of HfO_{2} thickness (Fig. 8). Therefore, the presence of Hf–Si–O bonds can be correlated to a structural transition region between SiO_{2} and HfO_{2} where the formation of negatively charged defects, like interstitials oxygen or hafnium vacancies, can occur.
Finally, it is important to note that chemical silicon oxide process is a low temperature process (65 °C) which is perfectly adapted for back-end process, wherein process' temperatures are limited to 400 °C. Table II outlines the main results concerning the comparison of chemical and thermal silicon oxide.
IV. SUMMARY
To conclude, HfO_{2} deposited by ALD on a chemical silicon oxide is a good candidate as a passivation layer. As hydrogen can saturate the interface dangling bonds, we observe a significant impact of hydrogen on defect density at the Si/SiO_{2} interface. We have shown that hydrogen is provided both by H_{2}O from HfO_{2} ALD cycles and by the chemical oxide. Chemical passivation by hydrogen has been demonstrated using MIR measurements showing the absorbance of Si–H bonds. Therefore, HfO_{2} deposited using ALD on a chemical silicon oxide provides an excellent chemical passivation of the silicon surface. ALD HfO_{2} adds negative charges located at the SiO_{2}/HfO_{2} interface and correlated to Si–O–Hf bonds. Moreover, hydrogen seems to passivate positively charged defects in the SiO_{2} underlayer. Finally, the increasing of the negative charge strengthens the chemical passivation due to the hydrogen by a field effect passivation.
