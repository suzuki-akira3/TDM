Sb-induced strain fluctuations in a strained layer superlattice of InAs/InAsSb
We show that Sb substitution for As in a MBE grown InAs/InAsSb strained layer superlattice (SLS) is accompanied by significant strain fluctuations. The SLS was observed using scanning transmission electron microscopy along the [100] zone axis where the cation and anion atomic columns are separately resolved. Strain analysis based on atomic column positions reveals asymmetrical transitions in the strain profile across the SLS interfaces. The averaged strain profile is quantitatively fitted to the segregation model, which yields a distribution of Sb in agreement with the scanning tunneling microscopy result. The subtraction of the calculated strain reveals an increase in strain fluctuations with the Sb concentration, as well as isolated regions with large strain deviations extending spatially over ∼1 nm, which suggest the presence of point defects.
I. INTRODUCTION
Epitaxially grown InAs/InAsSb strained layer superlattice (SLS) have attracted significant interest because of their type-II band alignment. The electronic properties of type-II superlattices (T2SLs) are favorable for mid-wavelength (MW) and long-wavelength (LW) infrared (IR) detector applications [1–4]. Recent studies have demonstrated significant improvements in the minority carrier lifetime and dark current density for the MWIR and LWIR photodetectors based on the InAs/InAsSb T2SLs [5–7], compared with the Ga-containing InAs/GaInSb T2SLs [8,9]. The short minority carrier lifetime in the Ga-containing T2SLs, which limits the photodetector device performances [10–12], has been attributed to point defects that act as Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination centers [13]. A crucial parameter in the design of T2SLs is lattice strain and its balance. Unbalanced strain leads to the formation of extended defects, such as dislocations, in the T2SL thin films [14]. Information about lattice strain in general is required to calculate the SLS bandgap and band edge positions for accurate modeling of the superlattice miniband structure and the device design optimization [15]. Another important, but less studied, parameter is strain uniformity; deviations from the average strain profile impact local electronic structures, while large strain deviations suggest the presence of defects.
The strain in the InAs/InAsSb T2SLs is related to the Sb composition. During MBE growth, the Sb distribution is determined by surface segregation and exchange reaction between anions at high temperatures [16], which can only be determined experimentally. In case of the InAs/InAsSb T2SLs, it has been shown that a small variation in Sb content significantly affects the photoluminescence (PL) transition energies that are related to the photodetector cut-off wavelength [4]. Thus, the determination of strain and Sb composition is essential for understanding the electronic properties of the InAs/InAsSb T2SLs.
The composition of an MBE grown InAs/InAsSb T2SL was previously measured by atomic-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) on a monolayer-by-monolayer basis following wafer cleavage in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) [17]. The isovalent replacement of As with Sb atoms on the cleaved surface was identified by the resulted change in the filled-state densities under a negative sample bias. By breaking the chemical bonds, the measured surface structure, e.g., the position of surface atoms, is different from the bulk structure due to surface relaxation. However, the structural change does not affect the chemical identification [18,19]. Strain in principle can be measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD); however, only the average strain can be obtained from the diffraction profile through model fitting [20].
To access local strain information, we performed an atomic resolution strain analysis of the same MBE grown InAs/InAsSb T2SL studied by STM [17]. Our analysis uses high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) imaging in an aberration corrected scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) [21]. The images were recorded along the crystallographic [100] zone axis and analyzed using the template matching (TeMA) method to calculate the lattice strain [22]. The improvement in the spatial resolution achieved by TeMA over the popular geometric phase analysis (GPA) algorithm [23–25] allows us to probe strain, and the related Sb composition, in the InAs/InAsSb T2SLs.
II. EXPERIMENTAL
The InAs/InAsSb T2SL studied here was grown on a GaSb substrate by solid-source molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) at Sandia National Laboratories. The constituent layers were deposited on a (001)-oriented GaSb substrate under an anion overpressure of ∼1.5:1 and growth rate of 0.9 monolayers/s (ML/s). The substrate was held at approximately 420 °C and rotated continuously throughout deposition. The T2SL consists of 100 periods of 4.6 nm thick InAs and 1.7 nm thick InAs_{1-x}Sb_{x} with the targeted composition of x = 33.3%. A separate layer of GaSb (buffer layer) was grown between the T2SL and the GaSb substrate. The cross-sectional TEM sample used for HAADF imaging was prepared by mechanical wedge polishing, which was followed by ion milling using 3.0 kV and 1.0 kV Ar ions at the glancing angle of 6°. During ion milling, the sample was kept at the liquid nitrogen temperature to minimize the ion-induced surface damage [26]. Atomic resolution HAADF imaging was performed using a Nion UltraSTEM (Kirkland, WA), which is equipped with a cold field emission gun and a probe aberration corrector. The microscope was operated at the accelerating voltage of 100 kV to minimize the structural damage caused by the high-energy electron knock-on effect (under the imaging conditions used in this work, no visible structural damage was observed). The convergence semi-angle (α) for the incident electron probe and the HAADF detector cutoff angles were set to 31 mrad and 86–200 mrad, respectively. The depth of focus (DoF ≈1.772λ/α^{2}) [27] for our STEM observation is about 6.8 nm. During HAADF imaging, the electron probe was scanned parallel to the film growth direction, so the out-of-plane direction strain measurement is not affected by the so-called “fly-back” error, which introduces a systematic error in the measurement of strain normal to the scan direction [21,22,28]. Using the recorded HAADF images, strain was measured by TeMA at atomic resolution [22]. High-resolution XRD (HRXRD) spectra were separately acquired using a PANalytical Materials Research Diffractometer system with a radiation wavelength of 1.5406 Å (Cu K_{α1}). Figure 1 shows the ω-2θ X-ray scan data for the (004) reflection of the T2SL and calculated spectrum using the composition-correlated strain model (CCSM) [29]. This model assumes that the atomic distance between neighboring atomic layers are related to the local composition, which can be directly calculated using the Vegard's law. The average out-of-lattice constant (d) and the modulation period (Λ) of the InAs/InAsSb T2SL were measured at 6.0966 Å and 6.28 nm, respectively, which are close to the original design of d = 6.0959 Å and Λ = 6.30 nm. Details of the determination procedure are presented elsewhere [29].
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Strain and composition in the InAs/InAsSb T2SL
For HAADF imaging, the TEM samples were prepared along the crystallographic direction of [100]. Figures 2(a) and 2(b) show a schematic of the atomic structure viewed along the [100] zone axis and a recorded HAADF image of GaSb, respectively. Most TEM observations of III-V semiconductors have been performed along the ⟨110⟩ zone axes, which gives the well separated dumbbells formed by a pair of anion and cation atomic columns [30]. When observed along [100], on the other hand, the projected unit cell consists of one atomic column (Ga or In) at the center and another atomic column (Sb or As) at the corner; those atomic columns are equally spaced from each other. Because of this, the intensity overlap between neighboring atomic columns along the [100] projection is minimized. Figure 3 shows the simulated images of GaSb at different sample thicknesses using the multislice algorithm [21]. From the simulated images, the position of each atomic column was determined by TeMA and the nearest atomic distances (Δ) between Ga and Sb columns were measured at 215.54, 215.53, and 215.55 pm for the 10, 30, and 50 nm thick samples, respectively, while the nominal atomic column distance for GaSb along [100] is 215.53 pm. The similar values of Δ at different sample thicknesses indicate that the multiple scattering effects on the determination of atomic column positions are minimal along the [100] projection [31,32].
Figure 2(c) displays an atomic resolution HAADF image of the InAs/InAsSb T2SL from a sample region near the GaSb buffer layer. The image shows the excellent crystallinity of the T2SL with no visible structural defects. Since the atomic number of Sb (Z = 51) is larger than that of As (Z = 33), the InAsSb layers appear brighter than the InAs layers, resulting in alternating bright and dark contrast. For strain mapping, each atomic column provides a sampling point. The unit distance for strain calculation is a/4 as denoted in Fig. 2(a).
Figure 4(a) shows the strain map along the growth direction (out-of-plane) obtained from the HAADF image in Fig. 2(c). The strain value measured here is based on the out-of-plane lattice constant difference between the GaSb buffer layer and the film (ε^{⊥}=(af⊥−a_{GaSb})/a_{GaSb} with af⊥ for the out-of-plane lattice constant in the film). This is different from the mismatch strain (ε_{m}=(a_{f}−a_{GaSb})/a_{GaSb}, where a_{f} is the lattice constant of the film). The mismatch strain arises from the lattice constant difference in bulk crystals, which is typically used in the field of material mechanics [33]. The GaSb buffer layer, where the lattice mismatch with the GaSb substrate is minimal, is used to measure a_{GaSb}.
The InAs and InAsSb layers in the T2SL are clearly distinguished in the strain map due to their lattice constant difference. The nominal composition of Sb in InAsSb is 33.3% and 0% in InAs, which leads to a_{InAsSb} = 6.199 Å and a_{InAs} = 6.0583, respectively, according to the Vegard's law, while the lattice constant of stoichiometric GaSb is 6.0959 Å [34]. In the T2SL, the InAs layer is under tensile in-plane strain and thus the out-of-plane strain has a negative value, while the InAsSb layer is under compressive in-plane strain and the out-of-plane strain has a positive value in the strain map. Using the Poisson's ratios of 0.35 and 0.31 for InAs and GaSb, respectively [34], the epitaxially grown InAs on GaSb should have an ε^{⊥} of −1.28% and ε_{m} of −0.62%. Similarly, the ε^{⊥} of InAs_{0.67}Sb_{0.33} on GaSb is calculated at 3.52%. Figure 4(b) plots the measured ε^{⊥} in the InAs/InAsSb T2SL along the growth direction. The positive and negative strain modulation is clearly seen in the profile across the four periods of alternating InAs and InAsSb layers. The measured ε^{⊥} ranges from −1% in the nominal InAs to +3% in the nominal InAsSb layer.
Figure 5 displays the averaged ε^{⊥} across a single superlattice period of 20 monolayers and the calculated Sb contents. The averaging was performed over 7 periods from a sample area of 98.47 nm^{2}. The strain profile at the InAs-on-InAsSb interface is more extended than that at the InAsSb-on-InAs interface. This finding is consistent with the previously reported STM and TEM studies [17,24]. The asymmetric anion segregation at the interfaces was previously attributed to the surfactant nature of Sb, which has a tendency to segregate to the growth front [35,36]. Segregation of atomic species during film growth is a common feature in the synthesis of heterojunctions [36]. To further evaluate chemical intermixing at the interfaces between the InAs and InAsSb layers, we utilized the phenomenological segregation model first suggested by Muraki et_al [37] According to this model, a fraction of atoms (R) in the topmost layer segregate to the next layer while the remaining fraction of atoms (1-R) is incorporated into the underneath bulk lattice. The fraction R is dictated by the atomic exchange reactions occurring during the film growth. As a result, the Sb fraction in nth layer in an InAs/InAsSb T2SL can be described as follows: 
where x_{o}, x_{b}, and N are the nominal Sb composition, the background Sb composition, and the thickness of the InAsSb layer, respectively. Using the least squares fitting (black solid line in Fig. 5) of the average strain profile by the calculated strain based on the composition profile of the Muraki's model, we obtained the coefficients x_{o}, R and x_{b} at 0.316± 0.028, 0.746 ± 0.024, and 0.035 ± 0.006, respectively. We also compared the Sb composition profile obtained from the STM measurement (Fig. 5) [17]. Good agreement was observed for the anion intermixing at both InAs-on-InAsSb and InAsSb-on-InAs interfaces, while the measured Sb concentration in the nominal InAs is somewhat higher than the STM result.
A major concern in the TEM based strain analysis is that the thin-film stress can be significantly relaxed near the surfaces of the prepared TEM sample [38]. Lattice plane bending near the specimen surfaces can cause significant change in the measured atomic peak positions and yield surface strain rather than the representative bulk strain. In a superlattice of period Λ, the strain can be analyzed based on the spatial frequency mΛ and its Fourier components. Treacy and Gibson showed that the superlattice tends to exhibit bulk behavior at the interface, with the relaxation of each Fourier component being confined to a shallow depth ∼Λ/m from the surfaces, even in thin specimens [38]. Away from the interface, where the low frequency Fourier components dominate, the relaxation penetrates deeper and will behave as a relaxed thin film if t ≤ Λ where t is the sample thickness. The thin-film relaxation effect was examined in our previous study of strain and composition in an InAs/GaSb superlattice strain based on a comparison with the X-ray diffraction results [29]. The finding is similar to the agreement we observed here with the STM measurement. The difference between the HAADF imaging and STM results is in the magnitude of Sb concentration in the middle of the nominal InAs layer, which could be impacted by the strain relaxation effect for t ≫ Λ [38].
B. Strain fluctuations and identification of strain defects
The strain map in Fig. 4(a) shows significant strain fluctuations. To further investigate the fluctuations, we compared the experimentally measured strain with the strain calculated using the Muraki's model and Vegard's law. Figure 6 plots the squared strain deviation (SSD), which is calculated by (Strain_{STEM} − Strain_{Muraki}) [2]. The SSD is averaged over each monolayer and plotted as a function of the monolayer-averaged Sb content measured from the strain map. The increase in the SSD with Sb content indicates that the substitution of As with Sb in the InAsSb induces larger strain fluctuations in the InAsSb layers. Figure 7 identifies the two-dimensional (2 D) distribution of the strain fluctuations. Figures 7(a) and 7(b) show the strain map of two superlattice periods taken from the white dotted box region in Fig. 4(a) and the calculated strain map based on the Muraki's model and Vegard's law. The difference between the two, i.e., Strain_{STEM} − Strain_{Muraki}, serves as a measure of strain fluctuation [Figs. 7(c)]. Local strain fluctuations with a spatial extent on the order of ∼1 nm are seen in the difference map. For example, in Fig. 7(c), a large positive difference value of 3.7% is found at location I, while a large negative SSD value of −3.9% is found at location II. The large difference values in the nominal InAsSb layer can be attributed to the local high and low concentrations of Sb in the anion atomic columns, i.e., Sb and As segregations.
Figure 7(c) also identifies several locations (as indicated by the white arrows) with the unexpectedly small or large strain values. The strain values at these locations deviate from the Muraki's model by an amount of equal to, or greater than, 3σ. Here, the σ represents the standard deviation of strain values in the monolayer. The measured σ in the GaSb substrate is 0.86%, corresponding to a change in distance of 1.3 pm (see supplementary material). The location III in Fig. 7(c) is an example where a difference of −4.2% is observed in the strain value, while the Muraki's model predicts a strain value of −0.71% for the located monolayer. The σ of the monolayer is 1.39%. The anion atomic column marked by the arrow in the magnified image in Fig. 7(d) is associated with an observable displacement at the location III, with respect to the average atomic plane position (the dashed line). The spatial extent of strain fluctuation (∼1 nm) rules out the presence of extended defects and suggests a point defect, or point defect(s), at this location. According to reported theoretical studies, vacancy-type defects in III-V semiconductors induce an inward relaxation of the nearest atoms by 10%–20%, depending on the chemical species and charge states, which is largest among point defects [39,40]. Previously, the measurement of atomic column positions in the HAADF images was successfully used to detect point defects in oxide thin films [41]. The atomic relaxation around a vacancy defect could explain the large local strain fluctuation observed here; it would be of further interest to verify this hypothesis with modeling. Especially, point defects such as vacancies and antisite defects are important in the T2SLs since the minority carrier lifetime is mainly limited by SRH recombination [42,43].
With the above method, we identified 8 locations in the 15 × 15 nm^{2} area of the T2SL where the strain values deviate beyond 3σ, leading to the defect density of ∼5 × 10^{18} cm^{−3} by taking the depth of focus into account. The smaller strain fluctuations (<3σ) are correlated with the Sb contents. The significance of local strain fluctuations can be estimated based on the impact on the deformation potentials. The deformation potentials for InAs and InSb are a_{c}= −5.08 eV, −6.94 eV, a_{v}= 1 eV, 0.36 eV and b = −1.8 eV and −2 eV, corresponding to the shift in conduction and valence band energies and the split of hole energy, respectively [34]. On average, the amount of strain variations inside the InAsSb layer is about 1.35%, which amounts to the change in the deformation potentials from ∼5 to 94 meV with the largest impact on the conduction band energy shift. Additionally, the variation in local compositions also introduces a change in the energy gap, which can be estimated using E_{g(InAsSb)}=(1−x)E_{g(InAs)}+xE_{g(InSb)}−x(1−x)C with C = 0.67 eV [44]. The 1.35% change in strain amounts to 9.46% change in anion compositions (x) and 50 meV change in the energy gap.
Overall, our strain mapping technique demonstrates a sensitive way to measure local strain and probe local strain fluctuations. By correlating atomic scale strain measurement with theoretical studies that consider point defect induced atomic relaxations and their impact on the HAADF image contrast in future, further insights about atomic configurations around a point defect and impacts on the electronic structure could be obtained.
IV. CONCLUSION
In summary, we performed strain measurement for a Ga-free (InAs/InAsSb) T2SL using atomic resolution HAADF imaging. The results revealed asymmetric interfacial anion segregation. The average strain profile obtained from the HAADF images can be quantitatively fitted to the Muraki's segregation model using the calculated Sb composition by the Vegard's law, and the results are in quantitative agreement with the STM composition measurements. By subtracting the average strain profile from the experimental strain maps, we are able to go beyond the composition determination by further examining local strain fluctuations and demonstrating the correlation between local strain fluctuations and Sb contents. The same method also enables us to identify strain defects, where local strain deviated significantly from the average strain.
