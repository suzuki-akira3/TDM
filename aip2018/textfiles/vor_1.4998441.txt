Controlling defects in fine-grained sputtered nickel catalyst for graphene growth
Sputter-prepared nickel (Ni) films can lose more than half their starting thickness due to evaporation in hydrogen (H_{2}) annealing environments. The loss rate of the sputtered Ni films during the chemical vapor deposition growth of graphene has not been reported earlier. The evaporation rate of sputtered Ni film with the amorphous, mixed, preferred ⟨111⟩ texture was experimentally determined to be 20, 11, and 6 nm/m, respectively. An increase of argon mixture in H_{2} was found to reduce pitting defects in the films during annealing. The quality of grown graphene on top of the Ni improved when the growth temperature was raised from 900 to 1000 °C, as monitored by Raman spectroscopy. More importantly, loss in the starting Ni film thickness can inhibit the growth of graphene layers. By maintaining the growth of the graphene to two layers or less, a high optical transparency of 95% or better can be achieved.
I. INTRODUCTION
Graphene is a 2D material composed of one to several layers of atomically arranged hexagonal carbon atoms that can be grown on metals that act as catalysts. For electronic applications, graphene has a high predicted electric carrier mobility, good mechanical flexibility, and high optical transmittance [1–3]. These properties are advantageous as components in devices such as field effect transistors [4], solar cells [5], and gas and chemical sensors [6,7]. The advancement of graphene-based electronics is hampered by difficulties in controlling the number of graphene layers, the uniformity of coverage over large areas, and the stacking order of the layers. It should be mentioned that although single-layer graphene has been grown successfully, it is not single crystalline, meaning that the perfect hexagonal arrangements of carbon atoms are interrupted by defects and grain boundaries of the metal.
Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has been developed for graphene growth directly on top of metal surfaces, including copper (Cu) [8], nickel (Ni) [9,10], ruthenium (Ru) [11], platinum (Pt) [12], and iridium (Ir) [13] for these purposes, and among those Cu and Ni are among the most promising for large area graphene at a relatively low cost. CVD-grown graphene on Ni in the form of cold-rolled foil [14] tends to produce in a disordered and randomly rotated fashion, resulting in suboptimum electronic properties [10,15]. Higher purity Ni, controlled texture [16] with (111) texture that matches the graphene lattice very well [17,18] can be deposited in the form of thin films by evaporation and sputtering methods. During the initial nucleation stage, graphene has been observed well-aligned along the (111) plane of the Ni metal catalyst surface [19,20].
Graphene growth by atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD) on the Ni catalyst surface is typically divided into three stages: annealing and metal grain growth, carbon source diffusion, and a fast or slow furnace temperature ramp down rate to control the precipitation of carbon to the metal catalyst surface for the growth of graphene. A variety of argon (Ar), nitrogen (N_{2}), methane (CH_{4}), and hydrogen (H_{2}) gas flows can be used. H_{2} use is critical in the APCVD process to prevent oxidation of the Ni catalyst and to aid in the process during growth of few-layer graphene (FLG). CH_{4} is the most popular precursor source gas for carbon due to its low pyrolysis rate, although acetylene (C_{2}H_{2}) and ethylene (C_{2}H_{4}) have been reported with higher pyrolysis rates [21]. The typical temperature for graphene growth using CH_{4} precursor is in the range of 900 to 1025 °C. The growth of FLG has been reported for CH_{4} concentrations ranging from 2 to 16 vol. % [22–25], and in some cases even at levels less than 2 vol. % [15,26,27].
Hydrogen use is especially critical in APCVD to prevent the oxidation of the Ni catalyst surface at high temperatures. Although it is known that H_{2} aids in the formation of active species for the production of good quality graphene, it also etches away unwanted weak carbon–carbon bonds [28]. Thiele et_al [29] initially investigated sputtered Ni films with preferential (111) texture, but the H_{2} requirements, the surface pitting, and the effects of different graphene growth temperatures were not fully investigated. In this report, we prepared Ni samples ranging in textures from amorphous to highly crystalline films by the sputtering method. We studied the different textured Ni films during annealing under different H_{2}/Ar ratios to determine pitting defects, and the effects of prepared films on the crystallinity disorder of grown graphene in CH_{4} gas at 900, 950, and 1000 °C.
II. EXPERIMENT
Three types of Ni film textures were prepared to a thickness of 300 nm by magnetron sputtering at 2 mT pressure using a CVC-601 system equipped with an in situ quartz heating lamp at substrate temperatures of 25, 100, and 250 °C for samples S1, S2, and S3, respectively. All Ni films were coated on a 280-nm layer of SiO_{2}/Si substrates. The starting Si substrates are commercial polished quality, 100 mm in diameter, 500 μm thickness, (100) orientation, and n-doped with phosphorous. The three individual sets of samples were then loaded into an APCVD furnace for 10 min annealing, one at 900 °C, and second at 950 °C, and third at 1000 °C. The H_{2} flow varied between 200 and 700 sccm and a balance of Ar was used to maintain a total gas flow of 1000 sccm in the furnace at all times. Next, the graphene growth was accomplished by the addition of CH_{4} gas source 0.5 vol. % for 10 min. The cool down step was controlled to a slow rate of 5 °C/min, while maintaining the same flow rates of CH_{4}, H_{2}, and Ar. After cooling to a temperature of 500 °C, the furnace cover was opened to allow a faster cooling rate of approximately 100 °C/min to room temperature. The gases were turned off when the furnace reached room temperature, and the substrates were removed. To determine the loss in Ni film, duplicate samples were prepared and run separately in the APCVD process without the CH_{4} step. A physical step on these films was prepared by mask patterning technique using traditional photolithography followed by etching of the Ni in FeCl_{3} solution. After the mask removal step, a step height measurement of the remaining Ni film for S1–S3 was taken using a Tencor model P-15 scanning stylus measurement system.
The morphology of the as-deposited and annealed samples was analyzed by atomic force microscope (AFM) model Veeco NanoScope V in the contact mode. The Ni texture was determined by the Powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) method using Rigaku Ultima III with the Bragg-Brentano focusing method using CuKα1 and λ = 1.5406 Å. The grown graphene films were characterized by Raman spectroscopy using a WITec Alpha 300RA system under high-intensity, low-noise settings of the CCD. Spectra were measured in the backscattering configuration using the 532-nm line of a frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser as the excitation source (∼1.5 mW at sample), with a 100× numerical aperture of 0.95 objective and 600 grooves/mm grating with 0.5 s integration time.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
A. Morphology
The morphology of the Ni film was controlled by substrate heating during the sputter deposition process. S1 that was sputter coated at room temperature (∼25 °C) produced very fine grain size of 35 nm with a surface roughness of 5.2 nm. Sputter coating of thin films at room temperature typically results in small grain sizes due to a high rate of nucleation [30]. S2 sputter-coated Ni at 100 °C resulted in grain size of approximately 90 nm with a surface roughness of 9.3 nm. A further increase in the substrate sputtering temperature to 250 °C for S3 produced noticeably larger grain size of approximately 600 nm with proportionally higher surface roughness of 27 nm. Films generally prepared by sputtering are polycrystalline in the as-deposited condition. There was an increase in the grain size with substrate heating during the sputtering process.
The sputter-deposited films were then annealed for grain growth for 10 min at 1000 °C with H_{2} and Ar flow rates at 0.3 and 0.7 vol. %, respectively. Annealed films can grow more than ten times larger from as-deposited conditions. Figure 1 shows images of the grains from as-deposited and postannealing conditions. Generally speaking, normal grain growth rarely occurs in thin films. Grain growth in films follows a well understood process of normal grain growth stage followed by an abnormal grain growth stage during which grains with (111) surface grow at the expense of others due to the low surface energy of (111) facets [31]. An important distinction of abnormal grain growth is that the resulting average grain size exceeds the film thickness after the annealing. It appears from initial observations that our annealed film grains, particularly as shown in Figs. 1(b) and 1(c), grew beyond ten times their as-deposited condition, which was achieved by abnormal grain growth [11].
The calculated average grain sizes after annealing for S1, S2, and S3 are 0.26, 2.83, and 5.14 μm, respectively. The average grain size for each of the images in Fig. 1 was calculated by dividing the image length by the number of grains intersecting along a chosen linear path. These values represent fine grains for thin films compared to coarse grains found in bulk Ni foils. The grain sizes varied greatly according to the sputter preparation conditions. S3 sputtered at 250 °C has the largest average grain size of 5.14 μm, consisting of approximately 80% large and 20% small grains, depicted in Fig. 1(c). The large grains have flat terraces that are essential for uniform graphene growth. S2 sputtered at 100 °C produced approximately 50% medium and 50% small sized grains, as depicted in Fig. 1(b). S1 sputtered at 25 °C produced equilaterally distributed small grains, depicted in Fig. 1(a). Our experimental observations show that Ni films prepared by sputtering at 250 °C produced grains containing flat terraces. An alternative method for producing large grains can be achieved by extending the annealing time during the APCVD process, but excessive Ni film loss occurs as we explain in Sec. III C.
B. Texture
We analyzed the texture of the annealed Ni films by powder XRD method. Texture is an important feature of any thin film as defined by the distribution of crystallographic orientations. The type of texture is denoted as hkl in this study. Commercially available Ni foils generally exhibit multiple XRD planes including (111), (200), and (220) with 2θ peaks corresponding to 44.4°, 51.8°, and 76.4°, respectively. We observed two of the major intensity peaks in arbitrary units for our samples shown in Fig. 2. The S1 intensity peak for (200) is less than half of the (111) peak. There was an increase in the (111) intensity peak and decrease in the (200) peak for S2 when the substrate temperature was raised from 25 at 100 °C during sputtering. The (111) peak reached maximum, and the (200) peak became null in S3 when the substrate temperature was raised to 250 °C. The sputter substrate temperature has a significant impact on the morphology of the Ni film. The complete transformation to a preferred (111) orientation is nearly 200 °C lower than previously reported by Thiele et_al [29] but the grains here are smaller in size. The films conversely had good adhesion and did not peel from the substrate after the annealing.
C. Thickness
A great amount of loss from the original Ni film thickness occurred during the APCVD annealing process, which varied according to texture and morphology of the films. All our prepared sputtered films had a starting thickness of 300 nm. S3, which had been prepared with the highest substrate temperature during sputtering, had the least loss of 60 nm while S1 with the lowest substrate temperature had the greatest loss of 200 nm after the annealing shown in Fig. 3.
S1 achieved the highest calculated Ni film loss rate of 20 nm/min. The corresponding XRD data from this sample also showed a relatively broad width-to-peak ratio representing low quality crystalline or amorphous film. The calculated rate of loss for S3, however, is greatly reduced to 6 nm/min when the film is of fully crystalline state according to the narrow width and high intensity (111) peak in Fig. 2. Surprisingly, the loss rate of Ni film in the present results is almost as fast as Cu in vacuum, even though the present experiments were conducted in atmospheric pressure. The sublimation of Cu in vacuum is estimated to be 66 nm/m [32]. The sublimation of our Ni should be at least a magnitude smaller than the Cu due to its lower vapor pressure [33]. Ni film prepared by the sputtering method is unique in that it has Ar inclusions that can drastically alter the cohesion and residual stress properties of the deposited film, unlike the evaporation method, and this may explain the unusually high sublimation rate.
Based on these associations, we are encouraged that Ni films prepared by sputtering with a preferred (111) texture can provide minimum loss rates while allowing for much longer annealing times necessary for achieving large flat plateau grains.
D. Pitting
When an excessive amount of H_{2} flow was introduced during the annealing step, blistering or pitting defects increased immensely across the substrate surface shown in Fig. 4(a). Pitting, in the form of holes on the surface measuring from 0.1 to 1 μm in diameter, was randomly dispersed across the surface. We established the number of pits across a surface area of 4500 μm^{2} for S1, S2, and S3 and plotted them against the H_{2} flow as shown in Fig. 4(b). The number of pits was found to be higher with an increase in the H_{2} flow. Pitting was minimized when the H_{2} flow rate was lowered to 30 vol. % and the Ar flow was raised to 70 vol. %. It appears from the plot that S3, with the highest sputtering substrate temperature of 250 °C, has the lowest pitting count. One explanation is that sputtered films prepared at higher substrate temperatures are denser and have a higher order crystalline texture that precludes the inclusion of internal H_{2} pockets. Interestingly, when we reduced the annealing temperature from 1000 to 900 °C, the pitting defects completely disappeared from the surface of the Ni. Mun and Cho [34] suggests holes or pitting can be avoided altogether by also increasing the film thickness beyond 300 nm.
E. Graphene growth qualities
The introduction of precursor CH_{4} gas 0.5 vol. % at 900, 950, and 1000 °C for 10 min produced growth of graphene on the surface of the Ni catalyst. The amount of CH_{4} precursor flow, temperature, and cooling rate has a strong effect on the number of grown graphene layers [22]. Dark patches on the surface of Ni are associated with few-layer graphene. As the graphene growth temperature increased the dark patches became darker in shade, representing greater graphene layers (shown in Fig. 5).
The growth of graphene on Ni occurs by carbon segregation method. During the graphene growth cycle, nucleation sites grow outward by the addition of carbon atoms to their edges to form islands and large domains [35]. The growth parameters of temperature, pressure, gas flow, and time are precisely mixed to let the graphene domains grow until they coalesce to form a continuous film [36]. However, carbon atoms segregating do not arrange themselves uniformly on Ni surface [37,38]. Instead, they segregate into sites with high surface energy, such as rough surface areas in the grain boundaries. Ni grain boundaries can degrade the physical and chemical properties of the grown graphene layers that result in poor electrical mobility [39]. Using a single-crystalline substrate [40,41] as a way to eliminate the catalyst grain boundaries and improve the grown graphene domain size has been proposed, but the added complexities and costs are not attractive for high-volume manufacturing. The optical properties of graphene film degrade with the addition of layers. The optical transparency of a single-layer graphene can be as high as 97%, and as high as 95% for bilayer graphene (BLG) in the visible light source corresponding to the wavelengths from 400 to 800 nm [3]. The typical transparency of few-layer graphene is in the 50%–80% range.
A single-point analysis of the graphene on S1, S2, and S3 at the growth temperatures of 900, 950, and 1000 °C has been investigated by Raman spectroscopy method. Of the three prepared conditions in Fig. 6, only S2 and S3 produced the typical spectra 1580 cm^{−1} (G-peak), 2650 cm^{−1} (G′-peak), and 1350 cm^{−1} (D-peak) that identify with graphene. Since the surface of Ni acts as a catalyst and S1 did not produce a highly crystalline texture according to our XRD data, then it is reasonable not to expect graphene growth in S1.
The disorder in the crystalline structure of graphene can be estimated by the D-band to the G-band intensity ratio (I_{D}/I_{G}) in the Raman spectra. The D-band is an indication of symmetry-breaking disorder in graphene. Generally speaking, higher I_{D}/I_{G} ratios mean greater disorder in graphene structure. Values less than 0.1 are usually indicative of well-ordered or good quality grown graphene. Large surface scanning 50 × 50 μm for S2 and S3 was initiated to study the shifts in the Raman intensity ratios with growth temperatures. A Raman histogram plot in Fig. 7 shows graphene disorder intensity ratio (I_{D}/I_{G}) in dark and is superimposed by the intensity ratio (I_{G′}/I_{G}) in light, which represents the number of graphene layers. The S1 is not plotted since it failed to produce signal peaks identifying the graphene spectra.
The Raman histograms for S2 with graphene growth at 900, 950, and 1000 °C are shown in Figs. 7(a)–7(c), respectively. When graphene was grown using S2 at 900 °C in Fig. 7(a), the disorder (dark curves) had high-intensity values near a ratio of 0.9, but when grown at a higher temperature of 1000 °C in Fig. 7(c), the intensity peaks shifted toward lower ratio values averaging 0.3. When graphene was grown using S3 at 900 °C in Fig. 7(d), the disorder (dark curves) had high-intensity values averaging 0.3 but this shifted toward zero when exposed to a higher temperature of 1000 °C in Fig. 7(f). The disappearance of the dark curves means no graphene disorder exists for S3 that was initially prepared at the higher Ni sputtering temperature 250 °C. This suggests that the disorder in graphene can be nullified when both the Ni sputtering and graphene growth temperatures are high values as represented in Fig. 7(f), which coincides with the disappearance of the dark curves. These results show that an increase in the Ni sputtering temperature of only 150 °C during the sample preparation step can drastically reduce the disorder during the growth of graphene. A plot summarizing the reduction in graphene disorder (I_{D}/I_{G}) ratio in association with increased graphene growth temperature is illustrated in Fig. 8(a). We propose the improvement in graphene quality is a result of the higher ordered crystalline quality of the starting Ni catalyst when it was sputter prepared at 250 °C, which aids in the add-atom carbon arrangement during nucleation and growth of the graphene domains. These results concur with molecular dynamics modeling from Meng et_al [42]
The number of graphene layers (light curves) can be estimated by the G′-band to the G-band intensity ratio (I_{G′}/I_{G}). This ratio can be an indication of the number of graphene layers because that number decreases by the addition of layers. In general terms, a ratio of 2 or greater represents single-layer graphene (SLG), 1 to 2 is BLG, and less than 1 is FLG [30,31]. When S3 was grown at 900 °C, the light curves in Fig. 7(d) had noticeably high ratio peaks at 1.5 (BLG) and 0.3 (FLG) but averaging near 0.8, which is closer to the saddle point of the plot. When the growth temperature was increased to 1000 °C the light curves in Fig. 7(f) shifted toward lower ratio values near 0.3 (FLG). A similar shift is observed in Figs. 7(a)–7(c) for S2 with increasing growth temperature. The increase in the number of graphene layers for both sets of samples S2 and S3 is consistent with the increased solubility of carbon in Ni at higher temperatures in accordance with the Ni-C phase diagram [43]. The solubility of carbon in Ni is approximately 0.9 at. % at 900 °C but increases to 1.0 at. % at 1000 °C. There is an important distinction in the amount of graphene layers produced between S2 and S3. When comparing the same growth temperatures as summarized in Fig. 8(b), S2 has consistently higher ratio values, meaning fewer graphene layers. S2 also had a greater loss than S3 in the starting Ni film. A loss in the Ni film during annealing has been shown here to reduce and inhibit the growth of graphene layers. Graphene should have grown on S1 with a Ni layer of 100 nm. A Ni film thickness of 100 nm should have allowed C atoms to dissolve 1–2 layers graphene at the growth temperature, and then precipitate from the Ni during the cooling according to Ref [44]. It is possible the finer grains found in S1 compared to S2 and S3 interacted with the bottom SiO_{2} to create a Ni silicide that interfered with the graphene growth [45]. S1 also shows a larger variation in the film uniformity and roughness compared to S2 and S3 according to Fig. 3. Ozceri and Selamet [46] mentions that Ni films thinner than 230 nm have increased surface roughness after annealing. The authors suggest that growth of high quality, large area, 1- or 2-layer graphene on polycrystalline Ni thin film can be optimized by the addition of Al_{2}O_{3} and/or Cr buffer layer to reduce the Ni surface roughness, and groove depth while controlling grain size and texturing in (111) orientation by annealing at 900 °C. Marchena et_al [47] cautions that ultrathin films of sputtered Ni below 50 nm can partially dewet at 900 °C, but under certain conditions, a graphene layer can still grow. More peculiar is that patches of graphene growth as large in area as 2 μm^{2} were found suspended between regions of dewetted Ni. All of our samples had a Ni layer equal or above 100 nm and showed no signs dewetting.
It is evident from our experimental results in Fig. 8 that the process can be optimized to minimize the defects, maximize the stacking order, and improve the growth of bilayer graphene. By maintaining growth of the graphene to two layers or less, its optical transparency can be equal to or greater than 95%.
IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Fine-grained Ni films are prone to degradation during annealing between the temperatures of 900 and 1000 °C in H_{2} annealing environments. Considerable film loss occurred when the initially prepared Ni films had an amorphous texture, but drastic improvement was observed when they were in a preferred (111) texture according to our XRD analysis. In order to minimize pitting defects on the Ni surface, we avoided H_{2} flow in excess of 30 vol. % by adding a balance of Ar flow. The amount of disorder in the crystallinity of the graphene was significantly reduced when the growth temperature increased from 900 to 1000 °C. Finally, a loss in the Ni film during annealing has been shown to reduce and inhibit the growth of graphene layers. By maintaining the growth of the graphene to two layers or less, a high optical transparency of 95% or better can be achieved.
