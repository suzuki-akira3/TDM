Gauss-Bonnet for matrix conformally rescaled Dirac
We derive an explicit formula for the scalar curvature over a two-torus with a Dirac operator conformally rescaled by a globally diagonalizable matrix. We show that the Gauss-Bonnet theorem holds and extends the result to all Riemann surfaces with Dirac operators modified in the same way.
I. INTRODUCTION
In this paper, we consider a new class of noncommutative algebras that lend themselves to spectral and geometric analysis. In noncommutative geometry, the metric structure on a noncommutative space A is encoded in a spectral triple on A and under suitable conditions, and using the spectral data, one can formulate a notion of the scalar and Ricci curvature for A [4,15]. In recent years, much progress has been made in understanding and computing the curvature invariants of curved noncommutative tori using the spectral properties of the Dirac operator [3–7,9–13,15,20]. In this paper, we consider a different class of noncommutative algebras, namely, algebras of matrix valued functions on a classical 2-dimensional Riemannian manifold, and prove a Gauss-Bonnet theorem for them.
Let M be a two-dimensional Riemannian manifold which we assume to be closed, connected, and oriented with a fixed spin structure. Let D: L^{2}(S) → L^{2}(S) denote the Dirac operator of M acting on the space of spinors. Consider the algebra A=C^{∞}(M)⊗M_{n}(C) of smooth matrix valued functions on M and its diagonal representation on H=L^{2}(S)⊗C^{n}. Taking the diagonal action of the Dirac operator, we obtain a spectral triple on A. Let h∈A be a positive element. We use h to perturb the spectral triple of A in the following way. Consider the operator D_{h} = hDh as a conformally rescaled Dirac operator. Although D_{h} does not have bounded commutators with the elements of A, we might still consider the resulting geometry as a twisted spectral triple [14] or a pass to h in the commutant of A [2]. In either case, the perturbation is of the same type. We would like to address the question: does the Gauss-Bonnet theorem hold for D_{h}? We provide a positive answer to this question.
Recall that the Gauss-Bonnet theorem for two-dimensional manifolds can be stated in terms of spectral zeta functions. For n = 1, that is, A=C^{∞}(M), where one deals with a commutative algebra, the spectral zeta function ζ_{D}(s) associated with the Dirac Laplacian D^{*}D is defined by
where the summation is over non-zero eigenvalues of D^{*}D. The zeta function is absolutely convergent and holomorphic for Re(s)>1 and has a meromorphic continuation to C with a unique (simple) pole at s = 1. In particular, ζ(0) is defined and it is well known that it is a topological invariant. For example, in the special case, where D=∂¯ is the Cauchy-Riemann operator of the complex structure defined by the conformal class of the metric, we have
where R is the scalar curvature and χ(M) is the Euler-Poincaré characteristic. Thus ζ_{D}(0) is a topological invariant, and, in particular, it remains invariant under the conformal perturbation g → e^{f}g of the metric [5].
For technical reasons, we assume that there is a unitary element U∈A such that h = UHU^{*}, where H is a diagonal matrix. Then
Therefore the spectrum of D_{h} is the same as the spectrum of D_{A,H} = H(D + A)H, where A is a matrix valued one-form.
In this paper, we show that the Gauss-Bonnet theorem holds for the family of conformally rescaled Dirac operators with possible fluctuations D_{A,H} = H(D + A)H where the rescaling is a diagonalizable matrix, and we compute the local expressions for the scalar curvature. The main point of using the diagonal matrix H as the conformal rescaling is that H commutes then with all its derivatives thus making the computations feasible.
In the computations, we use the matrix valued pseudodifferential operators over the manifold, as opposed to the methods used in Ref [18]. The results demonstrate that unlike in the case of higher residues there, the expressions for the value of the ζ function at 0 are complicated also in the matrix case.
Among other examples of curvature computations for noncommutative manifolds, we should mention the Moyal sphere [8], where the algebraic approach of Ref [26] was applied, and the differential geometry based construction for the 4-sphere [1], as well as the toric noncommutative manifolds [22].
II. COMPUTATIONS FOR THE TORUS
Consider the canonical spectral triple for a flat two torus M=R^{2}/Z^{2}. Its spin structure is defined by the Pauli spin matrices σ^{1}, σ^{2}, and its Dirac operator is
Here δ_{1}, δ_{2} are the partial derivatives 1i∂∂x and 1i∂∂y.
To compute the resolvent kernel, we work in the algebra of matrix valued pseudodifferential operators obtained by tensoring the algebra Ψ of pseudodifferential operators on a smooth manifold M by the algebra of n by n matrices. Let h = UHU^{*} be a conformal factor, where H is a diagonal matrix-valued function and U is a unitary matrix-valued function on a torus.
A. Computing the resolvent
We have the form of the symbol of the operator DA,H2=H(D+A)H^{2}(D+A)H,
where
Then the first symbols of (DH,a){−2}=b_{0}+b_{1}+b_{2}+⋯ are
Here
and in the above formulas, we have used that H commutes with δ_{i}(H).
The computations of b_{2} yield four parts, which we treat separately: independent of A, linear in A, quadratic in A, and terms depending on the derivative of A.
III. CURVATURE
Apart from the computations of the Gauss-Bonnet term, it is interesting to obtain an explicit formula for the local curvature term (or more accurately for the curvature modified by the local measure). We use the noncommutative geometry setup to compute the scalar curvature functional in the sense defined below.
A matrix-valued function R:T^{2}→M_{n}(C) we shall call a local curvature functional if for any f from the algebra of matrix valued functions on the torus the following holds:
where
Note that since we are working with the operator that is defined on the flat torus, the integral is with respect to the standard flat metric, and hence the matrix valued function R contains both the scalar curvature as well as the volume form arising from the metric defined by the Dirac operator D.
Using our assumptions and notation, for the Dirac operator, which has been conformally modified by a globally diagonalizable function, we obtain four contributions to the curvature functional term. In all computations below, we use the fact that H, δ_{i}(H), and b_{0} commute with each other.
A. Terms not depending on A
First term, which is independent of A and contains only functions of H and its derivatives δ_{i}(H), is therefore identical with the classical contribution,
Integrating out over the ξ space and using
we obtain
In the subsequent computation, we use Lesch rearrangement lemma [21] and denote by Δ conjugation by H^{4},
B. Terms linear in A
Linear terms do arise in b_{2} from the following terms (using local coordinates in a given chart):
Where by a_{1}(A), a_{0}(A), we denote the terms containing linear A in a(DH,A2), respectively.
First of all, observe that the expression is much simpler as it involves only (at most) first-order derivatives. As to compute the density, we can use any coordinate system; let us choose the normal coordinates around x ∈ M with respect to the metric g. First, the terms without derivatives reduce easily to the torus case (at point x). The only difficulty arises from terms with derivatives with respect to normal coordinates, that is, ∂kx(a2H) and ∂kx(a_{1}(A)).
However, since a2H=H^{4}g_{ij}ξ^{i}ξ^{j}, then we can use the fact that for the normal coordinates the first derivatives of the metric vanish at the point x and therefore the only remaining term would be the derivative of H^{4}. Therefore, the term that contains the derivative of a2H would be reduced to the term linear in A from the torus case (a point x and with the derivatives taken with respect to the normal coordinates).
Similar argument works also for the other term, a_{1}(A), which reads
and because in the term ∂kξ(b_{0})∂kx(a_{1}(A))b_{0} there are no further σ matrices, we can compute first the trace over the Clifford algebra and rephrase it as
obtaining again the metric. Hence, in normal coordinates at point x, the expression is again identical (in the sense of the dependence on A and H) to the one for the flat torus.
C. Terms linear in δ_{i}(A_{i})
In this case, we have
and again explicit integration over ξ gives
where
Again, it is not difficult to check that F(1) = 0, and the expression vanishes after we take the trace of it, so
D. Quadratic terms in A_{i}
We have
Integrating over ξ, we obtain
where
To compute the trace, we first take t = 1,
and observe that due to the trace property
But
and therefore,
so the quadratic term vanishes as well.
IV. THE GAUSS-BONNET THEOREM
The term which does not depend on A is a total derivative term
Since the trace is closed on the torus, this contribution to the Gauss-Bonnet term vanishes. For the linear terms as well as for the quadratic, we have already demonstrated that taking the trace gives 0, similarly as for the term depending on the derivative of A. Hence the conclusion,
Proposition 4.1. For the matrix conformally rescaled Dirac operator on the two-dimensional toru, D_{h} = hDh, where h is a globally diagonalizable positive matrix, the Gauss-Bonnet theorem holds
V. MATRIX GAUSS-BONNET FOR AN ARBITRARY TWO-DIMENSIONAL MANIFOLD
Let M be a closed, connected, two-dimensional Riemannian manifold and D be a Dirac operator for a fixed metric g on M. Consider the operator
for H being a diagonal matrix valued function on M and A being a matrix-valued one-form (identified here with their Clifford image).
We again aim to compute the value of ζ_{DH,A2}(0) using again the methods of pseudodifferential calculus. Of course, using the pseudodifferential calculus on a compact Riemannian manifold requires some care, as the formulation depends on local coordinates and requires patching together local data (see Ref [24] for a recent review and literature) using the partition of unity.
In particular, for a curved manifold, the expressions for the product of the symbols that were used in (2.2) become complicated (even using local charts and local coordinates) as the metric tensor depends on them. An example of the complexity for the products in the pseudodifferential calculus that uses normal symbols (based on the normal coordinates) is given in Ref [25]. In our case, however, we are interested only in the contributions that contain the term A, and therefore we can easily use the local arguments. Moreover, due to the seminal results of Guillemin and Wodzicki [17,27], the trace of the integral over the cotangent space of a classical symbol of order −2 provides a local density on a 2-dimensional manifold, and thus our computations are indeed coordinate independent.
Let us denote the (local) symbols of DH2 as
and the symbols of D^{2} alone as
Similarly, like in the case of the torus, we split the computation into the case of terms not depending on A, linear in A, and quadratic in A.
A. Terms independent of A
As the matrix H is diagonal, we can treat the case as H were a scalar function. Thus the problem is reduced to the problem of a usual conformal rescaling of the classical Dirac operator.
It is well known that for any conformal rescaling of the metric, the Gauss-Bonnet theorem holds, and therefore the contribution of the part of b_{2} that does not contain A guarantees that the value of the zeta function will remain unchanged provided that all contributions depending on A shall vanish. We examine the linear and quadratic contributions at each point x ∈ M of the manifolds using normal coordinates.
C. Quadratic terms
Now, let us concentrate on quadratic terms in A in the formula for b_{2}. They can arise only from two terms and are
where a_{1}(A) denotes the part of this symbol a_{1} which contains a term linear in A and a_{0}(A^{2}) similarly denotes the part of the a_{0} symbol containing the quadratic term. Note that this case is even simpler as there are no derivates, and it is easy to see that when written in normal coordinates the expression becomes
and
which again is naturally the same as in the case of torus.
D. The local density and the Gauss-Bonnet
As we have pointed out earlier, the symbol that we compute is of order −2 and integrated over the variables ξ contributes to a local density, so we can compute the value at each point in any coordinate system. Using the normal coordinate system, we have shown that at each point x using the local normal coordinate systems, the dependence on the A term is given through identical expressions as in the case of the flat torus. Therefore, using the arguments from Sec. III, we see that at each point x ∈ M, the linear and quadratic terms in A give no contributions to the local density and hence to the value of the zeta function of DH2. We note in passing that the use of normal coordinates in similar problems related to the computations of the density of Wodzicki residue was used, for example, in Ref [19].
On the other hand, since the matrix-valued function H is assumed to be diagonal, the H dependent terms can be treated in the same way as the scalar modification of the Dirac operator, that is, a case where H is just a function on M. The latter case, however, obviously does not change the Gauss-Bonnet term, and hence as a consequence, combining these two results, we conclude that the Gauss-Bonnet theorem holds for the arbitrary conformal rescaling of the Dirac operator over a two-dimensional Riemann surface if the rescaling matrix is diagonalizable. We shall briefly discuss in Sec. VI when such a situation is possible.
VI. DIAGONALIZABILITY OF MATRIX FUNCTIONS
Having demonstrated that for the special case of the globally diagonalizable matrix, the Gauss-Bonnet theorem holds and a natural question arises as to what extent the diagonalizability condition h = UHU^{*} is general. Is it always possible to find the unitary U? In what follows, we analyze the question in more detail.
Let X be a compact Hausdorff space and let H:X→M_{n}(C) be a continuous map with values in positive definite matrices. We also assume that for all x ∈ X, H(x) has a simple spectrum. A natural question is, if H can be continuously diagonalized? That is, if there is a decomposition h = UHU^{*} with h being the diagonal, U being the unitary, and both h and U being continuous. A similar question has been studied for normal and selfadjoint maps in Ref [16] where obstructions to continuous diagonalizability are identified. In our case of positive definite matrices, these obstructions are much easier to identify and the necessity of their vanishing is directly proved in this section.
We give now the complete obstruction for diagonalizability of H in terms of first Chern classes. Given a map H:X→M_{n}(C) as above, let λ_{1}(x) < λ_{2}(x) < … < λ_{n}(x), x ∈ X denote the eigenvalues of H(x). Since H is continuous and has a simple real spectrum, λi′s are continuous functions on X. Let E_{i}(x) denote the corresponding eigenspaces. We obtain complex line bundles L_{i} on X,
It is clear that H is continuously diagonalizable if and only if the line bundles L_{i} are trivial for all i. The obstruction for the triviality of complex line bundle L is therefore given by its first Chern class: L is trivial if and only if c_{1}(L) = 0. Thus the obstruction to diagonalizability of H lies in ⊕i=1nH^{2}(X,Z) so that H is diagonalizable if and only if
In particular, we get the following:
Proposition 6.1. Let X be a compact connected Hausdorff space such thatH^{2}(X,Z)=0.Then any continuous mapH:X→M_{n}(C)with values in positive definite matrices with a simple spectrum is continuously diagonalizable.It should be noted that if X is a smooth manifold and H is smooth as well, then the roots λ_{i}(x) will be smooth functions on X. It follows that the line bundles L_{i} will be smooth and in that case H will be smoothly diagonalizable, provided of course H^{2}(X,Z)=0.On the other hand, it is not difficult to give examples to show that continuous diagonalizability is not always possible. The simplest example is a sphere with the function
where σ_{1}, σ_{2}, σ_{3} are the Pauli spin matrices. They are selfadjoint and satisfy the relations σ_{i}σ_{j} + σ_{j}σ_{i} = 2δ_{ij}. Then F^{2}(x) = 1, the identity matrix, for all x ∈ S^{2} and therefore p=1+F2 is a projection in M_{2}(C(S^{2})). We have
Thus p has rank 1 and hence defines a complex line bundle over S^{2}. This line bundle is non-trivial in the sense that it admits no nowhere zero section, and hence p cannot be continuously diagonalized. In fact, it can be shown that this line bundle is the line bundle associated with the Hopf fibration
which has no nowhere zero section and hence cannot be a trivial line bundle. Alternatively, the first Chern class of this bundle can be explicitly computed as
which is a multiple of the volume form of the round sphere. In particular, ∫_{S^{2}}c_{1}(p)=−1. Now to get a non-diagonalizable positive definite map, let H = 1 + p. It has a simple spectrum for all x ∈ S^{2} and is a positive definite. Since p is not continuously diagonalizable, it follows that H is not continuously diagonalizable either.In fact, one can extend the result to all compact Riemann surfaces.
Proposition 6.2. If X is a compact Riemann surface, then there exists a non-diagonalizable smooth positive 2 × 2 matrix.
Proof. To show that we shall find a hermitian projection p that has a nontrivial Chern class and therefore cannot be diagonalized globally. Then, similarly as above, 1 + p is the desired positive non-diagonalizable matrix. The construction below extends the method of finding an explicit nontrivial projection on the torus, as shown in Ref [23].Let us take a product S^{1} × (0, 1) and define the following matrix valued function:
where 0 < t < 1 parameterizes the interval and 0 ≤ s < 1 parameterizes the circle. The matrix p(t, s) is a projection iff
The first Chern class of p could be explicitly computed as
Now, choose the functions g, h in such a way so that the support of g is in (ϵ,12) and the support of h in (12,1−ϵ) and they vary between 0 and 1. Furthermore, taking f to be increasing on the support of g from 0 to 1 and decreasing on the support of h, we can check the integral of the above form is
so that the projection p is nontrivial.Take now an arbitrary Riemann surface and find a circle and its tubular neighborhood. Then, as this tubular neighborhood is diffeomorphic with (0, 1) × S^{1}, we can use that diffeomorphism to define a matrix value map on it, which arises from the projection p. However, note that the projection p(t, s) is constant,
for t < ϵ and t > 1 − ϵ and so is its image. Therefore we can extend it in a smooth way to a matrix valued map on the entire Riemann surface. As the Chern number of the projection does not change, it defines a nontrivial line bundle. Taking 1 + p, we obtain a positive matrix (with constant eigenvalues 1 and 2) so that both eigenspaces are nontrivial line bundles.The above result does not generalize in a natural way to higher-dimensional manifolds, and we can formulate a question as follows. For a compact manifold X of dimension bigger than 2, if H^{2}(X,Z) is non-trivial, can one always find a positive matrix-valued H, which is not diagonalizable? If so, what is the minimal size of such a matrix? Another interesting problem is of a different type: having a smooth matrix valued function H on a manifold X, is there a Chern-Weil type description of obstructions to diagonalizability [which are obviously related to classes c_{1}(L_{i})] in terms of differential forms obtained from H?Finally, let us mention that although for the 2-dimensional manifolds the action remains purely topological, the study of the matrix-conformal rescaling in the higher-dimensional case leads to a question of the minima of the corresponding Einstein-Hilbert functional and the corresponding equations of motion.
