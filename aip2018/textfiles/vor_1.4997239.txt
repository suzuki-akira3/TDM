High current density and low emission field of carbon nanotube array microbundle
Field electron emission from carbon nanotubes shows promising application potential in devices. Low adhesive bonding strength between the carbon nanotubes and the substrate presents a practical challenge in environments such as high field emission current density. In this paper, we report on the performance of a carbon nanotube microbundle attached to a tungsten needle by a uniform glue layer. The device is easily fabricated without complex fixture and possesses a complete array structure. After curing the glue in air, the adhesive strength between the carbon nanotubes and the needle is over 2000 N/cm^{2}. Field emission measurements demonstrate that the maximum current density of the emitters is over 20 A/cm^{2} under a low applied field (<0.4 V/μm). The emitter with high current density, low emission field, and good stability has a wide range of applications in flat displays, X-ray tubes, and lamps.
Since their discovery, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have shown themselves to be promising candidates for use in field emission (FE) cathode materials due to their small tip radius, high aspect ratio, and excellent electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties. Previously, the FE current density of an individual pristine CNT with a diameter of 14 nm was reported to be ∼10^{3} A/cm^{2}. The turn-on electrical field of CNTs with different diameters range from 0.1 to 2 V/μm [1,2]. An individual CNT does not meet the requirements of uniform plane devices in many applications, such as FE flat plane displays and X-ray sources. Thus, CNT-based assemblies instead of individual CNTs are designed as FE cathodes, including arrays, films, and yarns. Vertical CNT arrays with appropriate orientation can supply dense and uniform emission sites. Low adhesive strength between the array and the substrate hinders performance, and hence application, of the CNT arrays in FE devices due to their inability to withdraw the Maxwell stress caused by the local electrical field [3], which causes the CNT array to separate from the substrate, resulting in the failure of the cathode.
The adhesive strength enhancement between the CNTs and the substrates is a direct method enabling the CNT cathode to work at higher FE current density. High temperature annealing can enhance the bonding of CNTs with the substrate [4,5], improve the graphitization of CNTs [6], and remove the amorphous carbon to purify the CNTs. Deng et_al [7,8] increased adhesive strength between the CNT array and the substrate by ion implantation before catalyst deposition. Another method is the use of a metal buffer layer, which simultaneously enhances the bonding between CNTs and the substrate and leads to improve the interfacial barrier simultaneously [4,9]. Similarly, lowering of the work electric field of the FE cathode enables CNT-based cathodes operate with higher FE current density under the same applied field. Fan et_al [3,10] modified the emitting sites of CNTs with low work function materials to lower the work electric field of the FE cathode. Likewise, grafted few-layer graphenes can lower the work function of the CNT tips [7,11,12]. Meanwhile, abundant graphene edges provide more emitting sites, resulting in improved FE stability [13].
In this work, the emitter is prepared by transferring the as-grown CNT array to the tungsten needle, in which they are bonded by a uniform glue layer. The adhesive strength increases after the curing of the glue in air. The FE test shows that the emitters have large FE current density (>20 A/cm^{2}) under a low applied field (<0.4 V/μm) and good stability at different FE current densities. Such improved FE properties have important applications in cold FE cathodes.
The fabrication process of the emitter is schematically depicted in Fig. 1(a). (S1 contains a detailed description.) The glue (JL15CSN2, Beijing JianLong Electronic Chemical Co. Ltd., China) consists of conductive carbon powder, modified resin, curing agents, and diluents. By controlling the rotation speed of the tip, a uniform glue layer is coated on the tungsten needle. Subsequently, the coated tungsten tip is rapidly moved onto the surface of the as-grown CNT array. A bundle of CNT arrays is attached and transferred on the needle, when the needle leaves the as-grown array. Further heating-curing of glue increases adhesive strength between the CNTs and the substrate. As shown in Fig. 1(b), a bundle of CNT arrays with a height of ∼200 μm is attached on the tungsten tip. The loose structure of the array is maintained during the whole preparation process [the inset in Fig. 1(b)]. This weakens the screening effect in emitting sites, which improves the FE properties of the emitter. The filling factor of the array is calculated to be 10 ± 2% using the liquid-induced compaction method [14].
Figure 1(d) presents a SEM image of the tungsten tip after adhesive strength measurements with the fracture position located at the interface between the bottom of the CNT bundle and the glue layer. The fracture morphology indicates that the adhesive strength between the CNTs and the glue is larger than that between the glue layer and the tungsten tip. The adhesive strength between the as-grown CNT array and its growth substrate is only 6.28 ± 0.92 N/cm^{2}. For the emitter bonded by the glue, the adhesive strength is 2.44 ± 0.42 × 10^{3} N/cm^{2} with the rotation speed of 2000 min^{−1}. When the rotation speed is faster than 2000 min^{−1}, the adhesive strength is almost unchanged. As the rotation speed is slower than 2000 min^{−1}, the adhesive strength decreases slightly [Fig. 2(a)]. This may be due to the slower rotation speed (S2 in the supplementary material) causing the non-uniform glue layer. However, compared to the as-grown CNT arrays, the glue-bonding method greatly increases the adhesive strength between the CNTs and the tungsten tip.
The FE properties are measured using a diode setup at room temperature. The emitters (1–4) are prepared with rotation speeds of 500, 1000, 2000, and 3000 min^{−1}, respectively. Figure 2(b) shows the plots of the FE current density of the bare tungsten tip and emitters as a function of the applied field. It is noted that all J-E curves are obtained immediately after a 5 h stability test, which is helpful for removing any adsorbates on the CNT tips. The cyclic J-E test indicates good repeatability for a sample after the stability test (S4), Table I. We define the applied fields corresponding to the FE current densities of 10 μA/cm^{2} and 10 mA/cm^{2} as the turn-on field E_{on} and the threshold field E_{th}, respectively. The minimum measurable current is 0.01 μA, which indicates that the exact applied field of the emitters is not obtained when the emitting area is smaller than 10^{−3} cm^{2}.
For the bare tungsten tip, the FE current density is zero below an applied field of 0.4 V/μm, pointing to the CNTs being the main contribution of the FE current in the emitters. For example, in the case of emitter 4, while the work field is from 0.15 to 0.3 V/μm, Fig. 2(a), the threshold field is only 0.16 V/μm and the maximum FE current density is 57.07 A/cm^{2}. Other emitters also exhibit good FE performance. The maximum FE current densities are 26.04 A/cm^{2} under 0.40 V/μm for emitter 1, 23.37 A/cm^{2} under 0.39 V/μm for emitter 2, and 17.55 A/cm^{2} under 0.33 V/μm for emitter 3. They are greater than that of the as-grown CNT array, 4.52 mA/cm^{2} under 2.83 V/μm.
Replotting the data as ln(J/E^{2}) versus 1/E, namely, the F-N plots, Fig. 2(b), shows typical F-N type FE behavior of the emitters. According to the previous results [15,16], CNTs with a diameter larger than 1 nm have a work function value of 4.55 eV. The field enhancement factor, β, of emitter 4 is 25 964. The difference in the field enhancement factors between different emitters may be related to the non-uniformity of the emitting area [3,17,18]. However, their field enhancement factors are over 10 000 larger than 2916 of the as-grown array.
Figure 1(c) shows the morphology of an emitter after discharge. The CNT microbundle is completely torn away by the electric field, which results in device failure due to discharge [3]. The fracture position is located at the joint between the CNTs and the tungsten tip. According to the adhesive strength measurement, the adhesive strength of emitters prepared under the rotation speed of 3000 min^{−1} is 2.35 ± 0.26 × 10^{3} N/cm^{2}, which is the achievable strength against tearing behavior. The maximum load of emitter 4 induced by the local electric field can be calculated from Maxwell stress σ⇀{s}=12ε_{0}Elocal2n⇀, where σ⇀{s} is the stress on a conductor, ε_{0} the dielectric constant of vacuum, E_{local} the local electric field, and n⇀ the surface's unit normal vector [3]. The load on an individual CNT is 2.29 × 10^{4} N/cm^{2}. Considering the filling factor of the array, the maximum stress on the array of emitter 4 before discharge is 2.29 ± 0.05 × 10^{3} N/cm^{2}, which is consistent with the measured adhesive strength. The similar measured adhesive strength and the maximum stress indicate that the higher adhesive strength between the CNTs and the tungsten tip is the key to enhancing the load bearing capacity and hence improving the FE performance of emitters. The measured adhesive strength and the calculated maximum stress of other emitters are also listed in Table I. They are approximately equal to each other likewise.
The stability of FE devices is another important factor in applications. Figure 3(a) shows the cyclic stability curves of emitters 1 and 4 at high FE current density. For example, in the case of emitter 1, significant aging can be observed in the initial hour of measurements during the 1st stability test [Fig. 3(a)]. The drop in the FE current density is 7.90 A/cm^{2}. The calculation of the temperature effect shows that the Joule heat at this current density is not enough to destroy the active emission sites in the emitters [2,19–21]. We speculate that the degradation may be caused by structural evolution of the CNTs or desorption of the adsorbates. After the aging, the average FE current density is 17.27 A/cm^{2} under 0.355 V/μm, with a fluctuation of only 0.20 A/cm^{2} (∼1.16%). Apart from that observed during the 1st stability test, there is no obvious degradation in the 2nd stability test in which the FE current density remains fixed at 16.90 ± 0.23 A/cm^{2} (∼1.36%). Similarly, the degradation of the FE current density is observed in the stability test of emitter 4. When the applied field is 0.275 V/μm, the drop in the FE current density in the 1st stability test is 6.35 A/cm^{2}. The average FE current density is 45.92 ± 0.54 A/cm^{2} in the stable emission stage of the 1st stability test and 45.38 ± 0.48 A/cm^{2} in the 2nd stability test.
Figure 3(b) shows the stability curves of emitter 1 under different applied fields, performed after the aging treatment. The average FE current density varies from 0.28 ± 0.07 to 19.38 ± 0.25 A/cm^{2}, when the applied field increases from 0.135 to 0.38 V/μm. There is a small increase in the deviation of the observed FE current density with a maximum fluctuation of only 1.29% for 19.38 A/cm^{2}. This small fluctuation meets the requirements in many applications.
In conclusion, we demonstrate the preparation of the emitters by following a process that includes spin-coating of glue on the tungsten needle and transferring of the CNT microbundle. The effect of the glue bonding remarkably increases the adhesive strength between the CNTs and the tungsten tip to over 2 × 10^{3} N/cm^{2} while maintaining in the emitter the loose and well-ordered structure of the array. The J-E test shows that the FE current density of the emitters can change from 10 mA/cm^{2} to 20 A/cm^{2} by controlling the applied field in the range of 0.1–0.4 V/μm, and a field enhancement factor of larger than 10,000 can be achieved. After the aging treatment, the fluctuation of FE current density is shown to be less than 1.5% at a FE current density of larger than 15 A/cm^{2}. The high FE current density, long-lasting stability of FE current density, low applied field, and facile fabrication process render CNT arrays suitable for use in applications such as X-ray tubes, lamps, and FE electron guns.
