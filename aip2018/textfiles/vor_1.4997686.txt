Nanoscale metal-InGaAs contacts with ultra-low specific contact resistivity: Improved interfacial quality and extraction methodology
To enable heterogeneous integration of InGaAs based transistors with Si complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) devices, metal contacts to n^{+}-InGaAs need to have high thermal stability for CMOS process compatibility and ultra-low contact resistance to achieve good device performance. In this work, n^{+}-InGaAs contacts with ultra-low contact resistivity ρ_{c} based on refractory metals such as molybdenum (Mo) were realized. Use of refractory metal contacts achieves good thermal stability. An improved process that eliminates oxide between the metal and n^{+}-InGaAs by using an in situ Ar^{+}-plasma treatment prior to metal deposition achieves ultra-low ρ_{c}. Furthermore, a nano-scale transmission line method (nano-TLM) structure with significantly reduced parasitic leakage was designed and fabricated to improve the ρ_{c} extraction accuracy. The improved test structure introduces a SiO_{2} isolation layer between Mo and InGaAs outside the active or mesa region to eliminate a parallel leakage path that is present in other nano-TLM structures reported in the literature.
I. INTRODUCTION
Due to its very high electron mobility, Indium Gallium Arsenide (In_{x}Ga_{1–}_{x}As) has been used in high-electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) for high speed or radio frequency applications [1,2]. In_{x}Ga_{1–}_{x}As has also been extensively researched as a channel material in metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) [3,4]. To further improve the device performance of HEMTs or MOSFETs, an ultra-low contact resistivity ρ_{c} between metal and n-InGaAs in the S/D regions in the low 10^{−9} Ω·cm^{2} or even in the 10^{−11} Ω·cm^{2} regime is required [5–7]. In general, ρ_{c} is smaller for a higher n^{+} doping concentration and for a higher indium content in InGaAs. For metal contacts formed on heavily doped n-type In_{x}Ga_{1}_{-x}As, where the carrier concentration is above 5 × 10^{19} cm^{−3} and x is higher than 0.53, ρ_{c} values of 4–6 × 10^{−9} Ω·cm^{2} have been reported [8]. When ρ_{c} is in the sub-10^{−8} Ω·cm^{2} regime, accurate extraction of ρ_{c} is of great importance.
There are various techniques or test structures used for the extraction of ρ_{c}, including transmission line method (TLM) [9,10], Refined TLM (RTLM) [8,11], Circular TLM (CTLM) [12], multi-ring CTLM (MRCTLM) [13], and nano-TLM [4,7,14,15]. In the standard TLM model, the metal contacts are usually very large (in the range of a few hundred μm), the distance separating adjacent contacts is in the range of a few μm, and ρ_{c} extraction is not accurate if ρ_{c} in the sub-10^{−8} Ω·cm^{2} range [8,14]. The measurement of ρ_{c} by TLM is also very sensitive to the placement of the current probe in the heavily doped semiconductors [8]. RTLM was designed to minimize the resistive contribution of the metal between the front edge of the metal pads and the voltage probes [8,14]. CTLM and MRCTLM are simple and efficient methods to measure ρ_{c}. The accuracy of the measured ρ_{c} by MRCTLM is comparable to RTLM, and its main advantage is that it can be fabricated using a more simplified process flow.
Recently, a two-port nano-TLM was proposed and demonstrated for extraction of very small values of ρ_{c} in the order of 10^{−9} Ω·cm^{2} [7,14]. Nanoscale contacts were made, and the non-negligible metal resistance is considered in the extraction of ρ_{c}. In the nano-TLM model, the metal sheet resistance (R_{shm}), the semiconductor sheet resistance (R_{sh}), and contact resistance (R_{c}) can be extracted simultaneously using the two-dimensional distributed circuit networks. However, test structures reported in the literature suffer from a non-zero leakage current that flows from the metal connectors outside the active region to the semiconductor substrate, and this can affect the accuracy of the extracted parameters. There is a need to reduce or eliminate the impact of the parasitic leakage current from the metal connectors to the substrate on the extracted parameters in the nano-TLM structure.
Surface defects and interfacial oxide are important factors which can significantly influence the contact resistivity of metal on the III-V semiconductors [16]. The electrical property of Ohmic contact is very sensitive to the fabrication process or conditions which would determine whether contaminants and/or semiconductor native oxides are effectively removed [17–26]. It is sometimes difficult to achieve low contact resistance reproducibly because the contact resistance is sensitive to the effectiveness of surface cleaning of the semiconductor prior to contact metal deposition [27].
In situ deposition of metal contact immediately after semiconductor epitaxy is an effective method to avoid contamination and oxidation of semiconductor surface [27,28]. Singisetti et_al reported in situ deposition of metal contacts to InGaAs using an electron beam evaporator attached to a MBE chamber by ultrahigh vacuum to investigate the impact of oxygen-free environment on the contact resistivity [27]. However, common process flows of fabricating a transistor usually require metal contact formation after the surface of semiconductor is exposed to the air [29]. It is also not possible to use the in situ method of Ref [27] if the contact is to be formed after the gate stack in a transistor.
Therefore, developing ex situ deposition of metal contact to obtain low contact resistivity is of great importance. It was demonstrated that the ultraviolet light-ozone (UV-O_{3}) treatment before wet etching the surface of InGaAs is an effective way to reduce the contact resistivity [30]. Sulfur treatment before metal deposition was also found to be an effective method for reducing the contact resistivity of InGaAs [31]. However, the surface of InGaAs can be contaminated and an ultrathin layer of native oxide can be formed in the time interval between surface cleaning and metal deposition [27,29]. Finding a suitable in situ surface cleaning before metal deposition is thus very important. In situ atomic H cleaning is a useful method to remove the oxide and contaminant from the surface of III-V semiconductor [32]. By combining wet chemical etching and in situ atomic H cleaning before metal deposition, contact resistivity of 1.1 × 10^{−8} Ω·cm^{2} was reported for n-In_{0.53}Ga_{0.47}As with a carrier concentration of 5 × 10^{19} cm^{−3}. However, substantial loss of the surface indium was reported for the InGaAs samples intensively cleaned by atomic H [33]. Cleaning the surface of InGaAs by low energy Ar^{+} ion bombardment followed by e-beam evaporation of metal contacts was demonstrated as an efficient way to avoid wet chemical etching and reduce the contact resistivity [34–36]. However, these papers do not provide detailed material analysis of the effect of in situ Ar^{+} plasma treatment on the surface of InGaAs.
In this paper, an improved nano-TLM structure that eliminated parasitic leakage paths between the metal lines and the semiconductor substrate is designed and fabricated to enable accurate extraction of ρ_{c}. Using the high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement, the interfacial properties and surface chemical composition after the removal of native oxides on InGaAs by in situ Ar^{+} plasma treatment are investigated. The effectiveness of in situ Ar^{+} plasma treatment before metal deposition in reducing ρ_{c} between the metal and InGaAs is demonstrated. ρ_{c} down to 8.8 × 10^{−9} Ω·cm^{2} was achieved, which is among the lowest reported values for n-type In_{x}Ga_{1–}_{x}As contact with indium composition below 40% (x ≤ 0.4).
II. EXPERIMENT
Three different kinds of test structures were fabricated: (a) nano-TLM structure without a SiO_{2} isolation layer between the metal lines and the n^{+}-In_{0.4}Ga_{0.6}As substrate, (b) nano-TLM structure with a SiO_{2} isolation layer between metal lines and n^{+}-In_{0.4}Ga_{0.6}As substrate, and (c) in situ plasma treated nano-TLM structure with a SiO_{2} isolation layer. The epilayers used in this work were grown on bulk InP substrates and comprise of a 300 nm thick In_{0.52}Al_{0.48}As (bottom epilayer), a 50 nm thick In_{0.53}Ga_{0.47}As, a 1 nm thick InP, and 30 nm thick Si-doped n^{+}-In_{0.4}Ga_{0.6}As (topmost epilayer). The measured active carrier concentration of the n^{+}-In_{0.4}Ga_{0.6}As topmost layer was ∼3.5 × 10^{19} cm^{−3}. All the other layers were unintentionally doped.
A top-view schematic diagram of the nano-TLM structure without the SiO_{2} isolation layer is shown in Fig. 1(a). Cross section schematic diagrams along lines A-A′ and B-B′ in Fig. 1(a) are shown in Figs. 1(b) and 1(c), respectively. The layer structure of the InP-based substrate is also illustrated in Figs. 1(b) and 1(c). This nano-TLM structure is similar to the reported nano-TLM structure in Refs [4],  [7],  [14], and  [15]. L_{c}, L_{d}, and W represent the width of the metal nanolines, the separation distance between the metal nanolines, and the width of the active semiconductor region, respectively. The active semiconductor region is the region through which the current flows from one metal nanoline to the other. As shown in Figs. 1(b) and 1(c), the metal connectors are in direct contact with the n^{+}-In_{0.4}Ga_{0.6 }As outside the active region. Therefore, leakage current can flow from the metal connectors outside the active region to the substrate. To prepare the nano-TLM structure without isolation layer, samples were first cleaned by acetone, isopropyl alcohol (IPA), and deionized (DI) water. This was followed by hydrochloric (HCl) acid (HCl:H_{2}O=1:3) treatment to remove the native oxide of InGaAs right before transferring the samples into the sputtering chamber. The time between the HCl (HCl:H_{2}O = 1:3) treatment and loading into the sputtering chamber was kept at ∼20 s. Around 30 nm-thick Mo was sputter deposited at pressure of ∼3 mTorr. After that, the sample was spin-coated with hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) and patterned by electron beam lithography (EBL) to define the nanoscale metal lines on n^{+}-InGaAs. Mo was etched by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) to form nanoscale metal lines on n^{+}-InGaAs using HSQ as the hard mask. The active region (mesa region) was then defined by spin coating the sample with HSQ and patterning with EBL. The mesa region was then formed by etching the InGaAs using the ICP and HSQ as the hard mask. Sample was then spin coated with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) resists and patterned with EBL to define the metal pads. Finally, metal pads were formed on the patterned sample using electron beam evaporation and lift off process.
Figure 2(a) shows the top-view schematic diagrams of the nano-TLM structure with a SiO_{2} isolation layer. The cross section schematic diagrams along line A-A′ and B-B′ of Fig. 2(a) are illustrated in Figs. 2(b) and 2(c), respectively. In this nano-TLM structure, the metal connectors are isolated from the substrate outside the active semiconductor region by a thin SiO_{2} film. To prepare the nano-TLM structure with SiO_{2} isolation layer, the sample was cleaned by acetone, IPA, and DI water. A very thin layer of SiO_{2} (around 10 nm) was deposited on the substrate at room temperature using e-beam evaporation. After depositing the thin layer of SiO_{2} on the n^{+}-InGaAs, the sample was spin coated by HSQ and patterned by EBL to define the isolation layers on the n^{+}-InGaAs. After that, the sample was etched by reactive-ion etching (RIE) to form the patterned SiO_{2} isolation layer on the n^{+}-InGaAs using HSQ as the hard mask. The sample was then cleaned by the HCl (HCl:H_{2}O=1:3) to remove the native oxide of InGaAs before deposition of the thin film of Mo. Mo was sputter deposited on the patterned n^{+}-InGaAs. The subsequent fabrication process flow is the same as that of the nano-TLM structure without the SiO_{2} isolation layer.
The fabrication process flow of the in situ plasma treated nano-TLM structure with the SiO_{2} isolation layer is similar to the fabrication process of nano-TLM structure with the SiO_{2} isolation layer. The only difference is the in situ plasma treatment of the surface of the sample before depositing the thin film of Mo. In situ plasma treatment time was varied from 1 to 7 min at an Ar gas flow rate of 25 sccm and plasma power of 50 W.
After completing the fabrication process, all types of nano-TLM test structures were annealed at 350 °C in nitrogen ambient for 1 min using a rapid thermal annealing system. L_{c} of the fabricated structures is varied from 70 to 200 nm.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Nano-TLM without and with the isolation layer
Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show the top-view scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the fabricated nano-TLM structures without and with the SiO_{2} isolation layer, respectively. In these structures, both ends of the two nanoscale metal lines can be separately probed. This enables the measurement of both parallel terminal resistance (R_{//}) and cross terminal resistance (R_{×}) which is needed for accurate extraction of R_{shm}, R_{sh}, and R_{c}. The measurement schemes of R_{//}and R_{×} are shown in Fig. 4(a). In the parallel scheme, the current is forced to flow from port A to port B, and the voltage drop is measured between ports C and D. In the cross scheme, the current is forced to flow from port A to port D and the voltage drop is measured between ports B and C. The corresponding expressions of R_{//} and R_{×} are given by [14]
where R_{TLM} and L_{Tx} are expressed as
The measured R_{//} and R_{×} were then fitted simultaneously using a nonlinear least square fit algorithm to extract R_{c}, R_{sh}, and R_{shm}. R_{//} and R_{×} as a function of L_{d} for the nano-TLM structures with L_{c} of 200 nm are shown in Figs. 4(b) and 4(c), respectively. We found that the extracted R_{c} of the nano-TLM structure with isolation layer is significantly higher than the extracted R_{c} of the nano-TLM structure without the isolation layer. The value of R_{c} extracted by the nano-TLM structure without the SiO_{2} isolation layer is lower due to the flow of additional leakage current from the Mo metal connectors into the n^{+}-InGaAs layer outside the active region, causing the extracted to be ρ_{c} systematically lower or more optimistic than the true value. ρ_{c} of the prepared samples can be determined by solving the following equation [37]:
The extracted ρ_{c} values by the nano-TLM structures without and with SiO_{2} isolation layer are compared in Fig. 5. The extracted ρ_{c} for the nano-TLM structure without SiO_{2} isolation layer is ∼2.2 × 10^{−8} Ω·cm^{2} which is smaller as compared to the extracted ρ_{c} of 4.8 × 10^{−8} Ω·cm^{2} for the nano-TLM structure with the SiO_{2} isolation layer. Therefore, insertion of a SiO_{2} layer between the metal connector and n^{+}-InGaAs layer outside the active region is very important to avoid a systematic error that reduces the extracted ρ_{c} value, and achieve a more accurate extraction of ρ_{c}. The importance of inserting an isolation layer in a nano-TLM structure to more accurately extract ρ_{c} can be applied to any metal/semiconductor contact.
B. Effect of plasma treatment
Low values of ρ_{c} of around 3.5 × 10^{−9} Ω.cm^{2} have been reported for n^{+}-InGaAs [27]. Therefore, presenting the accurate measurement technique, as we did here, is crucial to precisely evaluate the impact of surface preparation on the ρ_{c} of very low resistance contacts. The interface property between the metal contact and InGaAs, which has significant influence on ρ_{c}, is very sensitive to the effectiveness of surface cleaning of InGaAs prior to metal deposition. The surface of the n^{+}-InGaAs can be easily oxidized to form native oxides during the time interval between surface cleaning of InGaAs and metal deposition. The formed native oxides make the realization of ρ_{c} below 1.0 × 10^{−8} Ω·cm^{2} more difficult. To remove the native oxide that is formed in the time interval between the surface chemical cleaning and metal deposition, the surface of n^{+}-InGaAs was in situ plasma-treated in an Ar^{+} ambient prior to the deposition of Mo in the sputter tool.
Interfacial property between the sputter-deposited Mo and InGaAs without and with in situ Ar^{+} plasma treatment was investigated by performing XPS measurement. Four blanket InGaAs samples were prepared for the measurement. After HCl (HCl:H_{2}O=1:3) cleaning for 5 min, the samples were loaded into the sputtering chamber. Three of the samples went through 1, 3, or 7 min of in situ Ar^{+} plasma treatment and one did not. After that, a very thin (∼3 nm) Mo layer was sputter-deposited on these samples. The thickness of the Mo layer is selected to be smaller than the XPS information depth so that signals from the interfacial oxide can be observed. XPS characterization was then performed using a VG ESCALAB 220i-XL imaging XPS system. Monochromatic aluminum (Al) Kα X-ray (1486.7 eV) was used to obtain the core level spectra of these samples. The internal energy reference carbon (C) 1 s peak was set at 285 eV.
In order to confirm the impact of in situ Ar^{+} plasma treatment, high resolution narrow scan core level XPS spectra of the As 3d peak were captured at an analyzer pass energy of 40 eV for Mo-capped InGaAs blanket samples without and with in situ Ar^{+} plasma treatment, as shown in Fig. 6. The circles are the raw data points. Gaussian and Lorentzian line shapes with a Shirley background subtraction were used to fit the raw data. The lines are the fitted peak components after deconvolution. For the As 3d core level spectra, the main asymmetric peak at 40.8 eV corresponds to the As–Ga bond (As 3d_{5/2} and As 3d_{3/2}). The small peak at binding energy of 43.5 eV is attributed to the formation of As oxides (As^{3+} and As^{5+}). The As oxide (As_{x}O_{y}) signal is detected in all samples, which is due to the formation of native oxides in air before the samples are loaded into the sputter chamber. The ratio of area of As_{x}O_{y} peak to area of As peak (A_{AsxOy}/A_{As}) is determined from the fitted XPS spectra and is presented in Fig. 7. Compared to the control sample, A_{AsxOy}/A_{As} is significantly reduced from 0.189 to 0.045 for the sample with 7 min Ar^{+} plasma treatment, indicating that in situ Ar^{+} plasma treatment before Mo-deposition helped to remove the amount of remaining native oxide.
HR-TEM analysis was performed to further investigate the effect of in situ Ar^{+} plasma treatment before metal deposition. HR-TEM images of the samples without and with in situ Ar^{+} plasma treatment for 3 min are shown in Figs. 8(a) and 8(b), respectively. It can be observed that the thickness of the regrown native oxide is ∼1.5 nm and Ar^{+} plasma treatment for 3 min can effectively remove the native oxide.
Nano-TLM structures with SiO_{2} isolation layer were fabricated to extract ρ_{c} of the samples with in situ Ar^{+} plasma treatment with three durations of 1, 3, and 7 min. The effect of the plasma treatment time on the extracted ρ_{c} is shown in Fig. 9. In situ Ar^{+} plasma treatment for 3 min gives the lowest ρ_{c} of ∼1.4 × 10^{−8} Ω·cm^{2}. When the Ar^{+} plasma treatment time is 1 min, insufficient removal of the interfacial native oxide leads to a higher ρ_{c} than the sample with 3 min Ar^{+} plasma treatment. When the plasma treatment time is extended to 7 min, excessive damage to the InGaAs surface is likely to have occurred, leading to a higher ρ_{c} as compared to plasma treatment with 3 min. The sample with in situ Ar^{+} plasma treatment of 3 min was then annealed at 350 °C for 1 min using a rapid thermal annealing system to further reduce the specific contact resistivity. The ρ_{c} of the annealed sample is reduced from ∼1.4 × 10^{−8} Ω·cm^{2} to ∼8.8 × 10^{−9} Ω·cm^{2}.
In_{0.53}Ga_{0.47}As is a very commonly used In_{x}Ga_{1–}_{x}As composition in a wide range of applications. To predict the ρ_{c} of Mo contact formed on Ar^{+}-treated n^{+}-In_{0.53}Ga_{0.47 }As having a carrier concentration of 3.5 × 10^{19} cm^{−3}, we plot ρ_{c} vs. indium percentage in Fig. 10 based on the following analytical expression presented in Ref [38]:
where ρ_{c}, k, A^{**}, q, T, E_{00}, ϕ_{B}, and ϕ_{n} are specific contact resistivity, Boltzmann constant, effective Richardson constant, unit electric charge, absolute temperature, tunneling parameter (also called characteristic energy), Schottky barrier height, and Fermi potential from conduction band edge, respectively. The ϕ_{B} values used are extracted from Ref [39], which is based on Au contact on In_{x}Ga_{1–}_{x}As.
Our experimental ρ_{c} values for Mo/In_{0.4}Ga_{0.6 }As contacts with and without the use of Ar^{+} treatment are also plotted in Fig. 10. It can be seen that the ρ_{c} of Mo contact on Ar^{+}-treated In_{0.4}Ga_{0.6 }As lies on the analytically derived curve, indicating that Mo contact has a similar ϕ_{B} to that of Au following oxide removal by Ar^{+} treatment. If Mo contact on Ar^{+}-treated In_{0.53}Ga_{0.47 }As (carrier concentration of 3.5 × 10^{19} cm^{−3}) behaves similarly, ρ_{c} will be ∼4 × 10^{−9} Ω·cm^{2}. This value is lower than that (ρ_{c} of 0.69 × 10^{−8} Ω·cm^{2}) reported in Ref [14] for Mo contact formed on In_{0.53}Ga_{0.47 }As with a carrier concentration of 1 × 10^{19} cm^{−3}. ρ_{c} values of Ref [14] is also plotted in Fig. 10. This is not a direct comparison as Ref [14] used structures that do not have SiO_{2} isolation beneath the Mo lines outside the active region and a lower carrier concentration of 1 × 10^{19} cm^{−3} for In_{0.53}Ga_{0.47}As. The lack of proper isolation is expected to contribute to an extracted ρ_{c} that is lower than the actual value.
Figure 11 shows the reported ρ_{c} of the metal/n-type In_{x}Ga_{1–}_{x}As contact as a function of carrier concentration [40–45]. The indium composition of In_{x}Ga_{1–}_{x}As is also indicated. ρ_{c} of 8.8 × 10^{−9} Ω·cm^{2} achieved in this work is the lowest for n-type In_{x}Ga_{1–}_{x}As contact with indium composition of 40% and below (x≤ 0.4).
Comprehensive benchmarking of ρ_{c} of the metal/n-type In_{x}Ga_{1–}_{x}As is shown in Fig. 12. The impact of contact metal, metal deposition method, carrier concentration, and indium composition in the In_{x}Ga_{1–}_{x}As layer is indicated in this figure. Higher indium mole fraction in In_{x}Ga_{1–}_{x}As and higher carrier concentration are desired to reduce the ρ_{c} irrespective of the choice of metal or metal deposition method. The ρ_{c} achieved in this work can be further reduced by increasing the percentage of indium composition or carrier concentration of the In_{x}Ga_{1–}_{x}As layer.
IV. CONCLUSION
It is found that the leakage current from the metal connectors to n^{+}-InGaAs layer outside the active semiconductor region of nano-TLM structures causes a systematic underestimation of ρ_{c} or causes the extracted ρ_{c} to be lower than the actual value. An improved nano-TLM structure with the SiO_{2} isolation layer was proposed and fabricated so as to provide a more accurate extraction of ρ_{c}. It is also shown that an in situ Ar^{+} plasma treatment before metal deposition is an effective way to remove the native oxide between the metal and n^{+}-In_{0.4}Ga_{0.6}As. This method would be applicable for In_{x}Ga_{1–}_{x}As with different indium compositions. A detailed analysis to investigate the surface chemical composition after the removal of air exposed grown native oxide on InGaAs by in situ Ar^{+} plasma treatment is performed. Using the controlled in situ Ar^{+} plasma treatment before metal deposition, ρ_{c} down to 8.8 × 10^{−9} Ω·cm^{2} was achieved, which is among the lowest reported values for n-type In_{x}Ga_{1–}_{x}As contact with indium composition below 40%. ρ_{c} was obtained using the improved nano-TLM structure that eliminates the parasitic leakage paths between the metal connectors and the semiconductor substrate. Further reduction of ρ_{c} can be achieved by increasing the carrier concentration and the indium composition of In_{x}Ga_{1–}_{x}As.

The extracted ρ_{c} for the nano-TLM structure without the SiO_{2} isolation layer is smaller as compared to that for the nano-TLM structure with the SiO_{2} isolation layer. The lack of an isolation layer between the metal connector and the n^{+}-InGaAs outside the active region leads to increased leakage and an extracted ρ_{c} that is substantially lower. Reported nano-TLM structures in the literature (e.g., Ref [14]) did not employ isolation between metal lines and the semiconductor substrate outside the active region, and probably extracted a lower-than-actual value for ρ_{c}.
