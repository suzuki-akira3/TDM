Effects of growth rate on structural property and adatom migration behaviors for growth of GaInNAs/GaAs (001) by molecular beam epitaxy
We have investigated the structural properties and the growth mode of GaInNAs films prepared at different growth rates (R_{g}) by molecular beam epitaxy. The crystalline structure is studied by high resolution X-ray diffraction, and the evolution of GaInNAs film surface morphologies is studied by atomic force microscopy. It is found that both the crystallinity and the surface roughness are improved by increasing R_{g}, and the change in the growth mode is attributed to the adatom migration behaviors particularly for In atoms, which is verified by elemental analysis. In addition, we have presented some theoretical calculation results related to the N adsorption energy to show the unique N migration behavior, which is instructive to interpret the growth mechanism of GaInNAs films.
I. INTRODUCTION
GaInNAs alloys with a few percent nitrogen (N) have shown significant promise for extensive applications including long-wavelength diode lasers [1,2], high performance electronic devices [3], and high-efficiency solar cells [3–7]. Therefore, the deposition of dilute nitride GaInNAs on a GaAs (001) substrate has received great attention in the past two decades. The unique advantage of this dilute nitride is the adjustability both for the lattice constant and the bandgap, allowing the lattice of this material to match with GaAs or Ge over a wide range of bandgaps [8]. However, this alloy requires a low temperature growth, and both its optical and electrical characteristics are degraded even if a few percent of N atoms are added to the host (In)GaAs due to compositional fluctuations [9] and phase separation [10–12].
Because of this large miscibility gap of GaInNAs, the growth of high-quality films becomes the greatest concern. For the high crystalline quality of a film, it generally requires a monocrystalline structure with a smooth film surface, few defects, and dislocations. Therefore, considerable efforts have been put on the improvement of growth conditions including substrate temperature [13–15], the V/III ratio of the beam equivalent pressure (BEP) [16],in-situ rapid annealing conditions [17–19], the addition of a Sb surfactant [10,20,21], and the growth rate (R_{g}) [9,22] which are always the key parameters in growing GaInNAs films. However, the priority in these previous studies mainly lies in the N-related incorporation content, types of defects, phase separation, surface/interface roughness, etc. The analysis on these subjects enumerated above hardly reflects the growth mechanism of GaInNAs systematically. As one of the most important analyses in growth process aspect, the growth mode, including the shape, the size, and the density of nucleation islands, can reveal more about the adatom migration behaviors and their relations with the crystalline structure. Therefore, studies on this issue should have more attention.
In this paper, we introduce R_{g} as the variable for observing the change in the growth mode. Structural properties and surface morphologies are primarily studied to reveal adatom migration behaviors particularly for In atoms. Then, we carried out thermodynamic calculations to find an N-related stable configuration and to confirm N migration behaviors.
II. EXPERIMENT DETAILS
A. Experiments
A solid source molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) with a radio-frequency nitrogen plasma source has been used to grow GaInNAs films. The MBE growth was carried out on semi-insulating GaAs (001) substrates. Conventional solid source effusion cells were used for the evaporation of high purity In (7N), Ga (7N), and As (7N). A radio-frequency plasma source was used to generate active N species from high-purity (7N) N_{2} gas. Prior to the film growth, GaAs substrates were first outgassed at 200 °C and a subsequent oxide removal was performed at 600 °C in the MBE chamber. Two typical GaInNAs samples are presented in this work so as to study growth modes of GaInNAs layers at different R_{g}. Given that the substrate preparation, the temperature of the substrate, the rate of material deposition, the chemical form of the depositing species, and ambient conditions can all affect the growth of films and lead to dramatically different morphologies for the same combination of materials, GaInNAs samples were prepared at some fixed conditions such as the Ga + In vs. As BEP ratio and the ratio of In/Ga which were set to 1:20 and 1:15, respectively, and the nitrogen plasma source was operated at 200 W with a flux rate of 0.2 sccm. The only difference between these GaInNAs films is R_{g} which can be modulated by changing the total group III fluxes. Here, we label the GaInNAs films that were grown at 0.1 μm/h, 0.5 μm/h, and 1.2 μm/h as samples A, B, and C, respectively. Each sample contains an initial 200 nm thick GaAs buffer grown at 580 °C and a 200 nm thick GaInNAs layer grown at 440 °C. The capping layer was not deposited in consideration of the morphology observation.
B. Characterization
The as-grown GaInNAs samples were characterized by high resolution X-ray diffraction (HR-XRD, Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer with a Cu Ka_{1} X-ray source, λ = 0.15406 nm) for structural properties. Photoluminescence spectra were obtained using a FLS 920 spectrophotometer. Atomic force microscopy (AFM, MFP-3D-S Asylum American) was used to study the surface morphologies, and an Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS) was applied to the element analysis.
C. Simulation methods
In order to qualitatively investigate the dynamical behavior of N adatoms, Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation was performed based on the ab initio results. A (6 × 2 × 1) supercell is used to generate the step model. Geometry optimization procedures on the basis of the gradient-corrected functional are first carried out to acquire a stable GaAs (001) surface. In the stimulation process, we fixed previously adsorbed adatoms to the most stable sites, and the migration potential of the adatom that arrives next is then calculated. The Dreiding force field is employed in these calculations.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The first thing in this work is to study the crystalline structure of as-grown GaInNAs films by HR-XRD. The rocking curves presented in Figs. 1(a)–1(c) belong to the samples A, B, and C, respectively. Note that the GaInNAs diffraction peak of sample B [shown in Fig. 1(b)] overlaps with that of GaAs, and so, the overlapping peak resolving has been carried out separately. By comparing these GaInNAs (004) diffraction peak locations with those of GaAs (004), the peak shift can easily be found. According to the Bragg equation, the lattice constant of these GaInNAs samples is 5.676 Å, 5.654 Å, and 5.642 Å. The reduced lattice constant is attributed to either the increasing N content or the decreasing In content in the material. In previous studies, N atoms have been found to have a constant sticking coefficient, resulting in a linear increase in the N content with inverse R_{g} [20,23]. Moreover, although we increased the power of nitrogen plasma, the concentration ratio of N/As should be decreased due to the sufficient amount of As compared to that of Ga and N. Therefore, we believe that the decreasing In content is the main cause to this reduction of the lattice constant. Being in line with this inference, the nominal N and In contents in samples A, B, and C are determined according to an equation set, which comprises the Vegard law [describes the relationship between the lattice constant (a) and the compositions, Eq. (1)] and a gap width (E_{g}) expression (describes the relationship between the optical bandgap and the compositions) which is the following equation [11,15,24,25]:
where x and y are the mole percentages of Ga and As in this quaternary compound. δ is the band bowing coefficient. Here, δ(GaNAs) = −20 and δ(GaInAs) = −0.6. E_{g} is measured by the photoluminescence measurement, as shown in Fig. 1(e). Accordingly, we figured out the nominal N and In contents in samples A, B, and C, whose contents for N are 2.9%, 2.7%, and 2.1% and those for In are 8.6%, 7.6%, and 5.1%, respectively.
In order to further study the strain state in the GaInNAs film grown on a GaAs substrate, we have carried out a high-resolution reciprocal space mapping (RSM) measurement. Figure 1(f) shows the RSM of GaInNAs (224) for sample B, for example, from which the lateral and the vertical lattice constants, a_{ǁ} and a_{⊥}, can be calculated to be 5.655 ± 0.002 and 5.654 ± 0.008 Å, respectively. Likewise, the lateral and vertical lattice constants of the GaInNAs films for samples A and C can also be calculated from their RSM data, as shown in Table I. The strain relaxation of GaInNAs grown on the GaAs substrate should be expressed by the ratio between the mismatch at the interface, and it should be estimated by the following equation: R = (a_{//} − a_{s})/(a_{relaxed} − a_{s}), where a_{s} is the lattice constant of the GaAs substrate, a_{relaxed} is the relaxed lattice constant of the GaInNAs film, and a_{//}is the lateral lattice constant of the GaInNAs film measured by RSM. As we know that if the epitaxial film is fully strain relaxed, R will approach to 1 [26,27]. According to our calculation, the strain relaxation R for samples A, B, and C can be determined to be 0.595, 0.056, and 0.419, respectively. Considering both smaller R and ignorable in-plane deviation between sample B and the GaAs substrate (∼0.003), we can propose that sample B is coherently grown. As for samples A and C, the strain relaxation R is 0.595 for sample A and 0.419 for sample B on the one hand; furthermore, the in-plane deviation is 0.022 for sample A and −0.013 for sample C on the other hand. Considering both strain relaxation and lattice deviations, we can conclude that both samples A and C are moderately strain relaxed.
Apart from the composition fluctuation, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the GaInNAs diffraction peak is dependent on R_{g}, which can be seen in Fig. 1(d). As R_{g} increases, the FWHM decreases from 838 arc sec to 105 arc sec. Obviously, the crystalline quality gradually becomes better when R_{g} increases from 0.1 μm/h to 1.2 μm/h. The improvement on the crystalline quality of GaInNAs by increasing R_{g} has ever been reported in other studies [22,28]. The most common explanation to this issue is that the homogeneous N incorporation rather than the form of N-rich domains can be achieved at high R_{g}.
As a matter of fact, we also find that the increase in R_{g} can lead to a smooth GaInNAs film surface. Representative morphologies of GaInNAs samples measured by AFM are shown in Fig. 2. It can be observed from Fig. 2(a) that sparse compact islands evenly distribute on the film surface when R_{g} is as low as 0.1 μm/h. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of this 5 μm scan is 81 Å. In contrast, the surface of sample B [Fig. 2(b)] shows a high density of the coherent island, with a RMS roughness of 46 Å. A further increase in R_{g} in growing sample C results in a flat surface. No island can be observed from Fig. 2(c), and the corresponding RMS roughness is only about 10 Å. These results reveal that adopting higher R_{g} conditions in growing GaInNAs films is more favorable to obtain a smooth surface.
As for the change in the growth mode, it also depends on R_{g}. Considering that the island heights are only several nanometers, both the GaInNAs samples grown at 0.1 μm/h and 0.5 μm/h show a Stranski-Krastanov growth model rather than a three dimensional growth mode. Notwithstanding, we believe that the adatom migration behaviors are considerably more complex than that of the idealized Stranski-Krastanow model [29]. Because the special shape, the oriented growth (along with the [110] direction), and the uniform size of these compact islands are very conspicuous, indicating that the adatom migration and the deposition are influenced by other factors. In contrast, the surface of sample C shows a mirror-like roughness, and this results most likely from a layer-by-layer growth mode [22].
The change in the growth mode should be concerned, particularly for GaInNAs grown at low R_{g}. The differences between samples A and B are the density and the average size of these compact islands. It is well known that the density and the average size of islands are mainly determined by the adatom diffusion length [30–32]. More specifically, a large adatom diffusion length and a sufficient diffusion time make it possible for adatoms to cluster and form large islands with a low density. If this is the case, the increase in R_{g} hinders the adatom to migrate by reducing both the diffusion length and the diffusion time. Therefore, it is reasonable to find that the GaInNAs surface becomes relatively smooth after R_{g} reaches 1.2 μm/h.
To further study the adatom migration behavior, we compare the GaInNAs growth mode with that of InGaAs. Similar trapezoidal islands have ever been found by Lobo and Leon [33] in growing In_{0.6}Ga_{0.4}As, and they attributed the island formation to the migration behaviors of the group III element. The cause of 3D island formation in GaInNAs should be further studied. Thus, the EDS was used to compare the composition between islands and the flat surface of sample A. The results are shown in Fig. 3. Spectral signals shown in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) are collected after electron beams strike on the trapezoidal island and on the flat area, respectively. According to the measurement results, the concentration of In atoms in the trapezoidal island is significantly higher than that in the flat area. So, the In atoms tend to cluster and to form islands at low R_{g}, which leads to the In inhomogeneous distribution in the film. Besides, dislocations have been proved easily generated in this trapezoidal island in relatively early of the growth process [33–35]. Therefore, the consequences of this In migration behavior are the reduction of In incorporation and the degradation of crystallinity, as discussed in the aforementioned XRD analysis.
The results discussed above reveal that the In migration behavior is attributed to the formation of these 3D islands. But what is the role of N atoms? It seems that N atoms play an inconspicuous role in forming the trapezoidal islands. In fact, there is also a sign in EDS results that the concentration ratio of N/As in the 3D islands is much higher than that in the flat surface. If so, N atoms tend to gather in the islands and to form N-rich domains [8,36]. The driving mechanism of this phenomenon should be investigated. In 3D island growth, steps can act as preferential nucleation sites, resulting in stable nucleus formation and the layer covering growth [37,38]. For instance, As atoms are primarily incorporated into the step edge. Whether it is also suitable or not in describing the migration and incorporation behaviors of N atoms arouses our interest. Therefore, we build a model which contains two steps with (In)GaAs to serve as the depositional surfaces. This kind of step model is denoted as the N/(In)GaAs system in this work, as illustrated in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b). The intention of this action is to calculate the N adsorption energies when an N atom migrates through possible adsorption sites on these surfaces. The Dreiding force field is employed in these calculations. Note that the adsorption energy calculations are based on the interaction between N and (In)GaAs layers only in thermodynamics aspect.
Figure 5 depicts the distribution map of N adsorption energy in this N/(In)GaAs system. One should notice that the “negative” energy sign in Fig. 5 represents the energy releasing after N is adsorbed. It is beyond expectation to find that steps have a great influence on the N adsorption. It can be seen that the values of energies distributed on various layers are different, with the maximal one (−0.12 eV) locating at the top layer. The corresponding N adsorption energies on the second-layer and on the under-layer are −0.07 eV and −0.06 eV, respectively. From the system energy perspective, the top facet which provides the maximal adsorption energy is more favorable for N to incorporate and to form a stable configuration. Furthermore, it can be found in Fig. 5 that there are energy barriers for N diffusion over the step edges. The energy barrier at step 1 is as large as 0.05 eV, which is much larger than that at step 2 (∼0.01 eV). According to this result, the N diffusion from low facet to the high one occurs easily, while the reverse process is hard to proceed. That is to say, N atoms are more likely to gather on the top facet to form N-rich domains.
The epitaxial growth is usually performed at high temperatures. Thus, we have to take into account finite temperature effects such as atomic motion [39–41]. The Monte-Carlo method is one of the most popular ways to include the atomic motion at finite temperatures. To verify our hypothesis, another simulation based on annealing is then implemented to investigate what configuration it is when ten N atoms are put randomly into a large slab model. The result is presented in Fig. 6. It shows that most of the N atoms eventually migrate to the top facet by driving the thermodynamic equilibrium, exactly the same as discussed above. Besides, the annealing temperature in this simulation has little effect on simulation results. The stable N adsorption energy which is insensitive to the growth temperature accounts for this phenomenon [42]. However, R_{g} has a great influence on N migration behaviors, and this situation is similar to that of In migration.
Now, the growth process of GaInNAs including the adatom diffusion, the desorption, and the incorporation is clear. In the thermodynamic equilibrium conditions or a low R_{g} situation, both Ga and As atoms mainly participate in constituting the film matrix, while In atoms tend to cluster and to develop some In-rich compact islands. These islands provide favorable incorporation sites for the N atoms. If N desorption has not occurred, a larger diffusion length and a significant diffusion time can promote N atoms to gather on the top facet of these islands, forming some N-rich domains. So, these islands are rich in In and N atoms as compared with those in the film, easily resulting in the composition fluctuation, the phase separation, and the degeneration of crystallinity. This also gives an explanation to the phenomenon that In–N bonds are universally found in GaInNAs [43–45]. However, it is more complex in in-situ rapid annealing. Because it can not only offer the energy for N to go over the barrier and to diffuse to the top facet of islands but also offer the energy for N to diffuse inversely. Therefore, during the in-situ rapid annealing process, the higher energy fluctuation provides N atoms enough energy which may promote the formed In-N bonds to be broken again and the N atoms can diffuse away from In and move to another site.
In summary, R_{g} has a great influence on the migration behaviors particularly for the In and N atoms, which can lead to different growth modes. Based on these characteristics, structural properties and the surface morphologies of GaInNAs films are strongly dependent on various R_{g}. The results indicate that it is favorable to increase R_{g} so as to restrain the adatom gathering and to obtain high crystalline quality with a smooth surface of GaInNAs films.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
In this work, the MBE growth mechanism of GaInNAs related to R_{g} has been systematically studied. The crystallinity and the surface roughness have proved to be improved by increasing R_{g}. We also demonstrate the In migration characteristics according to the change in the growth mode. Theoretical calculations show that N atoms are easy to gather on the top facet of islands, which is driven by the thermodynamic stability.
