Laser induced surface and structural modification of germanium in liquid environments
Laser-induced surface and structural modifications of germanium (Ge) in liquid environments of deionized water and ethanol have been investigated. Single crystal Ge (100) has been exposed by KrF excimer laser at four different fluences. Scanning electron microscope analysis reveals the formation of cavities, cracks, and ripples in case of ablation in deionized water, whereas the formation of cavities, ridges, and pores is observed in case of ablation in ethanol. The distinctness, density, and size of cavities are significantly larger in deionized water as compared to ethanol. It is attributed to lower absorption coefficient of deionized water (0.2 × 10^{−2}/mm) as compared to ethanol (1.2 × 10^{−2}/mm) for 248 nm, and consequently, more energy deposition to Ge takes place in the case of ablation in deionized water as compared to ethanol. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy shows the formation of C-H stretching vibration band in case of ethanol at two moderate fluences. Raman spectroscopy reveals that only Ge-Ge band is formed at 300 cm^{−1} in both environmental conditions. The electrical conductivity of the irradiated Ge has been increased as compared to unirradiated Ge. However, it was observed that conductivity decreases with increasing laser fluence and also shows a strong dependence on ambient environment.
I. INTRODUCTION
Liquid-assisted ablation has been an emerging field with wide range of technical and scientific applications such as nanoparticle formation [1], nano/microstructure fabrication [2,3], dental tissue ablation [4], and surface cleaning [5]. Laser ablation depends on different irradiation parameters such as fluence, repetition rate, wavelength, pulse duration, and nature of ambient environment [6,7]. The liquid assisted process enhances the ablation efficiency by reducing ablation threshold due to confinement effects [8]. In liquids, significantly increased pressure as well as temperature of generated plasma, cavitation bubble formation [9,10] and long life time of shock waves is also responsible for the enhancement of ablation efficiency [11]. Due to elevated heat capacity, liquids efficiently cool the target preventing excessive heat accumulation and therefore making debris free ablation [12]. The chemical reactivity of irradiated samples also increases in the presence of liquid, and hence, various kinds of carbides, hydrides, and oxides are formed [13,14]. Ge is one of the most important semiconducting materials whose physical properties such as electrical conductivity, surface, and structural behavior can be significantly improved after laser ablation. Ge with improved characteristic is useful for electronics industry [15]. To the best of our knowledge, a very few work is reported in which Ge ablation in liquids has been investigated [15–17].
The present work deals with the investigation of the effect of laser fluence ranging from 0.64 to 0.85 J cm^{−2} on the surface, structural, and electrical modifications of Ge after ablation with KrF excimer laser. Targets were exposed under two liquid environments of deionized water and ethanol. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) is utilized for the investigation of surface morphology. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy are performed in order to correlate the structural and chemical changes with the surface morphology. Four probe method is employed for the measurement of electrical conductivity of the irradiated Ge samples.
The aim of the work was to correlate the surface morphological evolution of irradiated Ge with chemical alterations and its electrical behavior.
II. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE
Commercially polished Ge single crystal (100) in the form of wafer was selected as a target material. After cutting and ultrasonically cleaning, the Ge target of dimension 10 × 10 × 1 mm^{3} was placed in the self-fabricated stainless steel sample holder of dimension 35 × 19 × 11 mm^{3}. This sample holder was placed inside the quartz cuvette of dimension 40 × 20 × 20 mm^{3} and was mounted on XYZ manipulator. The cuvette was filled up with fresh liquids of deionized water and ethanol turn by turn for each exposure. The cuvette was placed in front of the laser in such a way that laser beam hits the target perpendicularly and liquid layer above the sample was 8 mm.
KrF excimer laser (EX GAM USA 200) with wavelength of 248 nm, repetition rate of 20 Hz, maximum energy of 150 mJ, pulse duration of 18 ns, and rectangular spot size of 11 × 7 mm was employed as a source of irradiation. The laser beam interacts with the target after passing through focusing lens of focal length of 50 cm. All experiments were performed at 5 cm before the focus position. The schematic diagram of experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1.
Ge samples were exposed at four different pulsed laser energies of 90, 100, 110, and 120 mJ under the ambient condition of deionized water and ethanol. These energies were controlled by changing voltage of high-voltage power supply of excimer laser system with the help of software. The energies were measured by power energy meter that corresponds to laser fluence of 0.64, 0.71, 0.78, and 0.85 J cm^{−2}, respectively, for a spot size of 5.6 × 2.5 mm. All experiments were performed with constant number of 500 pulses and repetition rate of 20 Hz. Surface modifications of the laser irradiated Ge samples were characterized by employing SEM (SEM-JSM-6480 LV Jeol). Structural behavior of laser ablated Ge was explored by FTIR spectroscopy (IR PRESTIGE-21 SHIMADZU) and Raman spectroscopy (MicroRamboss' DONGWOO Optron South Korea). Four probe method was utilized to examine the electrical conductivity of exposed Ge.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. SEM analysis
SEM images of Figs. 2(a)–2(d) reveal the surface morphology of ablated area of laser irradiated Ge by 500 pulses of excimer laser at wavelength of 248 nm and repetition rate of 20 Hz at different fluences of (a) 0.64 J cm^{−2}, (b) 0.71 J cm^{−2}, (c) 0.78 J cm^{−2}, and (d) 0.85 J cm^{−2} in a liquid confined environment of deionized water. Figure 2(a) shows the deep and large size cavities after exposure at a fluence of 0.64 J cm^{−2}. Multiple ablative layers or ripples are also seen around the cavities. The cracking as well as nonuniform expelled and resolidified material is also seen. By increasing fluence up to 0.71 J cm^{−2}, the density and diameter of cavities increase significantly. The demagnetized view is also seen in the inset of Fig. 2(b). Further increase in fluence up to 0.78 J cm^{−2}, more energy deposition is responsible for merging of cavities in the form of channels. At this fluence, again ripples are seen around the cavities [Fig. 2(c)]. At the maximum fluence of 0.85 J cm^{−2}, the size of the cavities are increased and ripples are distinctly seen around the cavities due to large energy deposition. Liquid assisted ablation plays a significant role for cooling and confining ablated species and plasma. An abrupt increase in temperature during laser induced plasma expansion vaporizes the liquid and cavitation bubbles are formed in the liquid. The ablated particles are removed from the surface, which are redeposited during ablation by the motion of bubbles. The surrounding liquid cools the target preventing from excessive heating. Generation of shocks waves is also induced by the collapse of cavitation bubbles. This generation further enhances the pressure and temperature at the collapse of cavitation bubbles [13,18,19]. These all phenomena are responsible for efficient mass removal from Ge target and cavities are formed [18].
The formation of laser induced periodic surface structures or ripples are also linked to the interaction of laser beam with the surface of electromagnetic waves generated during laser treatment of the target [19]. The continuous interaction of laser radiation with free electrons in the material results surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) [20,21]. The excitation of SPPs produces the periodic enhancement of local fields in the surface layer.
Hydrodynamic instabilities also play a significant role in the formation of ripples and cavities at the liquid–solid interface when laser interacts with the material [13].
The numbers of circular ripples [Figs. 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d)] around the cavities are also due to the formation of cavitation bubbles and its expansion [19]. The formation of cavitation bubbles can be seen clearly in the liquid during laser irradiation. The laser radiation diffraction from bubbles may induce circular ripples on the target surface. Due to high temperature plasma, liquid vaporizes to form bubbles at the liquid-solid interface and cools the target surface locally, exciting a capillary wave in the molten Ge through Marangoni effect [22,23]. The removal of thermal energy by vaporization and dissociation from the target surface exactly below the cavitation bubbles results to cool the target quickly. With the rise in temperature, surface tension reduces and hot liquid in the vicinity glides toward the cooler area deforming the surface [13]. This deformation can excite circular capillary waves. Superposition of the capillary waves induced by multiple pulse irradiation causes organized periodic surface structures [9]. The cracks appeared in Fig. 2(a) are due to thermal stress cracking [19]. Thermal stresses accumulate due to the multiple pulses and weakening of atomic bonds takes place. The rapid heating and cooling in liquid can generate excessive stresses and cause the formation of cracks.
SEM images of Figs. 3(a)–3(d) show the surface morphology of ablated area of laser irradiated Ge by 500 pulses of excimer laser at wavelength of 248 nm and repetition rate of 20 Hz at different fluences (a) 0.64 J cm^{−2}, (b) 0.71 J cm^{−2}, (c) 0.78 J cm^{−2}, and (d) 0.85 J cm^{−2} in a liquid confined environment of ethanol. At the lowest fluence of 0.64 J cm^{−2}, insignificant ablation takes place and no distinct features are seen [Fig. 3(a)]. Inset shows the demagnified view in which ridges are clearly seen. In liquid confined environment, most part of the laser light is absorbed by a target layer close to the solid-liquid interface that produces plasma. The liquid limits the free expansion of plasma, which in turn increases its temperature. This temperature vaporizes the liquid and causes the formation of cavitation bubbles. The diffraction of laser light by these cavitation bubbles produce wave like structures or ridges on the Ge surface due to the presence of low and high intensity fringes [24]. When the fluence is increased up to 0.71 J cm^{−2}, ablation and melting increases significantly with the appearance of nonuniform growth of cavities, pores, and uplifting ridges. With the further increase in fluence up to 0.78 J cm^{−2}, cavities are formed without melted surface but their density and size significantly increase due to large energy deposition. At the maximum fluence of 0.85 J cm^{−2}, cavities are merged together to form ablated channels. It seems not clear to draw trend evolution just from local high magnification SEM images; therefore, statistical analysis is made on the basis of lower magnification SEM images.
Figures 4(a)–4(d) depict the lower magnification SEM images of laser treated Ge samples under the ambient environment of deionized water. The dependence of cavities' diameter and density on laser fluence is shown graphically in Fig. 5.
The cavities' diameter and density increase with increasing laser fluence up to the value of 0.71 J cm^{−2}. With the further increase in fluence, it is observed that the diameter and density of cavities decrease and then increase at the maximum fluence of 0.85 J cm^{−2}. The cavities' diameter comes out to be 6.4, 8.1, 7.2, and 8.4 μm, whereas observed density of cavities is 0.5, 2.3, 1.3, and 1.4 cm^{−2} for 0.64 , 0.71, 0.78, and 0.85 J cm^{−2}, respectively. The enhancement in surface features with laser fluence is attributable to more energy deposition per unit area, but the reduction in density and diameter at 0.78 J/cm^{2} is due the enhanced melting [which can be clearly seen in Fig. 4(c)], consequently cavities refilled by this melted material [25].
Figures 6(a)–6(d) reveal the lower magnification SEM images of laser treated Ge samples under ethanol environment. The variation in size and in density of cavities with the variation of laser fluence in ethanol environment is graphically plotted in the graph of Fig. 7.
The cavities' diameter and density increase for all the laser fluences due to more energy deposition per unit area and found to be 0, 6.3, 7, 9.3 μm, and 0, for 0.3, 0.86, 1.6 cm^{−2}, respectively.
For the measurement of absorption coefficient of deionized water and ethanol, pulsed energy of excimer laser with wavelength of 248 nm is measured with power energy meter before and after the 20 mm thick cuvette filled with liquid and then normalizes it for 8 mm layer of liquid on the sample surface. In case of deionized water, 1.6% laser energy is absorbed by the liquid layer on the target surface, whereas in the case of ethanol, 9.6% energy is absorbed. After measuring percentage absorbed energy, the absorption coefficient is calculated for both liquids using Beer-Lambert law [26]
where x represents the layer thickness, α is the absorption coefficient (m^{−1}), and I_{0} corresponds to the incident laser intensity (W/m^{2}). I(x) is the energy of laser after absorption. By putting values of I(x), which is 0.984 in the case of deionized water and 0.904 for ethanol, and thickness of the layer (x), which is 8 mm in Eq. (1), the evaluated value of the absorption coefficient comes out to be 0.2 × 10^{−2}/mm for deionized water and 1.2 × 10^{−2}/mm for ethanol. It employs that the absorption coefficient of ethanol is six times higher than deionized water. Therefore, energy losses in ethanol are higher as compared to deionized water. Therefore, the ablation in deionized water is more pronounced and is responsible for more distinct features.
B. FTIR spectroscopy
Figure 8 shows the FTIR spectra of (a) untreated and laser treated Ge at four different fluences of (b) 0.64 J cm^{−2}, (c) 0.71 J cm^{−2}, (d) 0.78 J cm^{−2}, and (e) 0.85 J cm^{−2} under the ambient environment of deionized water. No new bands are identified for exposed Ge under the ambient condition of deionized water.
Figure 9 illustrates the FTIR spectra of (a) unirradiated and laser irradiated Ge at four different fluences of (b) 0.64 J cm^{−2}, (c) 0.71 J cm^{−2}, (d) 0.78 J cm^{−2}, and (e) 0.85 J cm^{−2} under the ambient environment of ethanol. At the initial fluence of 0.64 J cm^{−2}, no new peak is identified. Two peaks are observed at 2922 cm^{−1} for both fluences of 0.71 and 0.78 J cm^{−2}. These peaks correspond to C-H stretching vibration band [27]. At the maximum fluence of 0.85 J cm^{−2}, this peak vanishes again, which employs that C-H band dissociates due to enhanced photothermal and photochemical effects [28]. The high pressure and temperature plasma plume are generated during laser ablation of Ge in ethanol due to confinement effect of the liquid [8] which is responsible for the diffusion of hydrogen and into the lattice plane of Ge. The enhanced chemical reactivity of Ge with hydrogen and carbon results in the formation of C-H band.
C. Raman spectroscopy
Figure 10 reveals the Raman spectrum of (a) unirradiated and excimer laser irradiated Ge targets at various fluences of (b) 0.64 J cm^{−2}, (c) 0.71 J cm^{−2}, (d) 0.78 J cm^{−2}, and (e) 0.85 J cm^{−2} under ambient environment of deionized water. A sharp peak is observed at 300 cm^{−1} that corresponds to optical vibration of Ge-Ge band, which is the characteristic of crystalline Ge [21,29]. At a fluence of 0.64 and 0.71 J cm^{−2}, a slight peak shifting is observed at 295 and 298 cm^{−1}, respectively, due to laser induced stresses generated in Ge crystal [30,31]. These stresses are generated due to temperature and pressure gradients induced by laser irradiation [30]. As the fluence increases from 0.78 to 0.85 J cm^{−2}, laser induced temperature increases, which can be responsible for the relaxation of these stresses called pulsed laser annealing [32].
Figure 11 represents the Raman spectra of (a) unexposed and laser exposed Ge at various fluences of (b) 0.64 J cm^{−2}, (c) 0.71 J cm^{−2}, (d) 0.78 J cm^{−2}, and (e) 0.85 J cm^{−2} under ambient condition of ethanol. Raman signal is observed only at 300 cm^{−1} for all fluences, which corresponds to crystalline Ge-Ge band [21,29]. Higher pressure and temperature gradients due to more energy deposition in Ge and lower absorption coefficient in deionized water are possible cause for Raman shifting in the case of Ge ablation in deionized water, whereas in the case of Ge ablation in ethanol, no Raman shifting is observed, which is attributed to lower energy absorption.
D. Electrical conductivity
Figure 12 shows the electrical conductivity of laser irradiated Ge at four different fluences under the ambient environment of deionized water and ethanol. The conductivity of the unirradiated Ge is 2.0 s/m. These results show that after irradiation, conductivity of Ge increases for both environments. Therefore, a conclusion can be made that laser irradiation have a positive impact on Ge conductivity under both environments. The nucleation, agglomeration, coalescence, ridges, ripples formation, and hydrogen diffusion after laser ablation in liquid can introduce some additional interbands, which can be considered as possible cause for the reduction in optical band gap. The reduction in optical band gap is responsible for the increase in carrier concentration by the following relation [33]:
where n_{e} and n_{h} are the concentration charge density (electrons and holes, respectively), K_{B} is Boltzmann constant, m_{e} and m_{h} are effective mass of electrons and holes, respectively, E_{g} is the energy band gap, and T is the temperature.
Consequently, the increase in conductivity is observed after irradiation of Ge in liquid confined environment. In the case of ablation in deionized water, electrical conductivity gradually decreases from 3.8 to 3 s/m as the fluence increases from 0.64 to 0.85 J cm^{−2}, respectively, whereas in the case of ethanol, conductivity increases from 4 to 4.2 s/m as the fluence increases from 0.64 to 0.78 J cm^{−2} and it suddenly drops to 3.4 s/m at the maximum fluence of 0.85 J cm^{−2}. The behavior of electrical conductivity can be correlated with the surface morphology and incorporated hydrogen content detected by FTIR spectroscopy. In the case of irradiation of Ge in deionized water, the decrease in the conductivity with increasing fluence can be correlated with the increase in the density and size of cavities. The increase in number of density and size of cavities cause the resistance for flow of mobility carriers, which results in decrease in conductivity. The initial increase in the conductivity of ablated Ge at two moderate fluences (0.71 and 0.78 J cm^{−2}) in ethanol with increasing fluence is correlated with incorporation of hydrogen content. It is reported in the literature that the incorporation of hydrogen is responsible for the enhancement of electrical conductivity [34]. At the maximum fluence, the significant decrease in the conductivity is attributed to the absence of hydrogen and more number of defects in the form of cavities.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
The effect of laser fluence and ambient environment on the laser induced microstructuring on Ge has been investigated. Our results suggest that ambient environment plays a significant role in surface and structural modification of Ge. Various morphological features such as incomplete melting, cracks, and cavities of several micrometers in size with multiple ablative layers and ripples are formed in the ambient environment of deionized water, whereas in case of ethanol ridges, cavities of smaller size as compared to deionized water and pores are observed.
Convective bubble motion, cluster formation, low absorption coefficient of deionized water, and pressure gradients due to confinement effects of liquids are responsible for the formation of these structures. The ablation of Ge in deionized water is more pronounced due to smaller absorption coefficient as compared to ablation in ethanol. Raman spectroscopy results suggest that structural modifications are observed due to the generation of stresses in laser ablated Ge in deionized water, whereas in the case of ablation in ethanol, no significant structural changes are observed. FTIR spectroscopy revealed the presence of C-H stretching vibration band in the case of ablation in ethanol. The increase in electrical conductivity of laser irradiated Ge is observed for both environments. The change in conductivity is dependent upon the laser fluence as well as ambient environment.
