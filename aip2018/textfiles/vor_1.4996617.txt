Identification and tuning of zinc-site nitrogen-related complexes in ZnO material
In this article, the authors have designed an experiment to artificially introduce the recently proposed zinc-site nitrogen complex acceptors. The novel acceptors have been introduced in ZnO film samples grown at an atmosphere with extra-high oxygen partial pressure. The shallowness of the nitrogen complex acceptors has been experimentally verified. The concentration of the nitrogen-related complex acceptors could be tuned by varying the VI/II ratio in gas during growth. The modulation of the carrier concentration has been observed in accordance with the change of the complex concentration. Although theories predict higher formation rate of the complexes as monotonically increasing the oxygen chemical potential, experiments show that oxygen interstitials and/or antisite oxygen would compete the formation of the zinc-site nitrogen acceptors at extra-oxygen-rich gaseous condition.
I. INTRODUCTION
ZnO has been considered as a promising material for fabricating the light-emitting devices in the ultraviolet and blue spectral ranges for its direct wide band gap (∼3.37 eV) and high exciton binding energy (∼60 meV) combining with a low lasing threshold density [1]. To obtain the light-emitting devices with high efficiency, the n- and p-type of ZnO are both required to avoid the problem happening in heterostructures, like lattice and thermal mismatches. In fact, it is still problematic to obtain p-type ZnO with pronounced high conductivity. More efforts are needed to search of proper dopant and technique for better controlling the doping level. Different kinds of dopants, such as the group-VA elements (e.g., N, P, and As) and the group-IA/IB elements (e.g., Li, Na, Ag, and K) have been used to obtain the p-type ZnO [2–5]. In addition, the codoping method with two or more elements has been also employed to realize the p-type ZnO [6–8]. Among so many elements, nitrogen has been thought as the best candidate for p-ZnO for its low ionization energy, environmentally friendly nature, source-abundance, and similar atomic radius and electronegativity as O [9–11]. Many groups have realized the p-type ZnO by doping N [12–14], but the state of N atoms in ZnO, or say, the origin of p-type in the N-doped ZnO films is still controversial. Some groups thought that the p-type origin is from the O-site N (No) single acceptor [15–17], but recent calculations have shown that the No is a deep acceptor and it is not so possible to be the dominant reason of the p-type [18,19]. Two kinds of shallow acceptor forms have been put up subsequently. One is the complexes involving zinc vacancies (V_{Zn}) binding with nitrogen, such as No-V_{Zn} [20–22], the other is the nitrogen in complex forms, such as (NH_{4})_{Zn} and (N_{2})_{O} [23–25]. The doping level of the intrinsic defects V_{Zn} are hard to be controlled while the content of the nitrogen complexes is related to the growth condition during the growth process, so the nitrogen complex acceptors may be more practically important than those related to the intrinsic defects.
Bang et_al [23] and Lambrecht and Boonchun [25] have predicted that the (NH_{4})_{Zn} and (N_{2})_{Zn} are shallow acceptors in N-doped ZnO. However, there are rare reports on these nitrogen complexes experimentally. Ton-That et_al [24] investigated the treatment of nitrogen plasma on ZnO nanowire and confirmed that the (N_{2})_{Zn} complex creates a shallow acceptor state. Tang et_al [22] have grown the N-doped ZnO under different N_{2}O ratio and have tried to control the concentration of the nitrogen-related complexes. However, these former works [22,24] both focus on controlling the nitrogen doping level while ignoring the tuning of the oxygen chemical potential. Actually, it has already been suggested by the theoretical works [25] that these acceptorlike zinc-site nitrogen complexes may only be formed when the oxygen chemical potential is high enough. We believe that the tuning of oxygen chemical potential during growth may be a feasible way to control the formation of the nitrogen complexes. Besides, the properties of the nitrogen complexes are far from being fully understood due to very few reports with limited characterization methods. Therefore, in this article, we have designed an experiment to control the content as well as to study the properties of the nitrogen related acceptorlike complexes by fabricating the thin film samples under different oxygen chemical potentials. We have identified the nitrogen complexes on the zinc sites in terms of a combined characterizations from the Hall-effect, Raman, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-band electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and photoluminescence (PL). The tuning of oxygen chemical potential can certainly change the content of the nitrogen-related complex acceptors. However, extra-O-rich condition is also not beneficial to the formation of the acceptors because the oxygen antisites and/or the oxygen interstitials may be favorably formed at such a high VI/II ratio.
II. EXPERIMENT
We have grown ZnO thin-film on sapphire by a home-built metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) system. Dimethyl zinc [−10 °C, 2 standard cubic centimeter per minute (SCCM)] and ionized nitrous oxide (N_{2}O, 6 SCCM) were employed as zinc precursor and the nitrogen doping source, respectively. The chamber pressure and substrate temperature were optimized at 4 kPa and 400 °C, respectively. In order to realize the designed environment with high oxygen chemical potential, the strong oxidant, oxygen (O_{2}), was directly employed without dilution. Four N-doped samples were grown under different oxygen flux of 100, 130, 160, and 250 standard cubic centimeter per minute (SCCM), and marked as samples A–D, respectively. The thickness has been obtained by a step-profiler, and the thickness values of the samples were all measured as ∼200 nm.
A batch of measurements was employed to study the properties of the samples. The electrical property was measured by a Keithley Hall-system under van der Pauw's configuration. The magnetic field and current for measuring are 2 kGs and 1 μA, respectively. The vibrational properties were characterized by Raman spectra, which were recorded by a HR 800 Jobin-Yvon spectrometer equipped with an excitation source (514 nm) at a power of 5 mW. The chemical states and compositional analysis were analyzed by a Thermo Scientific TM K-Alpha TM x-ray photoelectron spectrometer system. An X-band EPR measurement was employed to further help identify the defects by a Bruker EMX-10/12 spectrometer operating near 9.49 GHz at 110 K, using a rectangular TE102 resonator. The samples were all cut to 5 × 2 mm^{2} rectangular shape and placed parallel to the measuring magnetic field. PL was excited by a He-Cd laser at 325 nm. A cryogenic system was employed to cool the samples down to 10 K. The spectra resolution was 0.1 nm.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Electrical property
The resistivity, Hall mobility, and carrier density are shown in Fig. 1. All samples show n-type characteristic. Basically, the mobility of all samples is nearly unchanged. Whereas the resistivity decreases from sample A to C and increases slightly from sample C to D. Correspondingly, the electron concentration increases from sample A to C and decreases slightly from sample C to D. This result is anti-intuitive because donorlike defects should be suppressed and the deep intrinsic acceptors may be formed as increasing the oxygen flux. This would result in a decreased carrier density trend. As a result, we could imply that at the employed growth condition with such a high oxygen chemical potential range, other mechanism besides the change of intrinsic defects should be responsible for the experimental observation. The sharp increase in carrier density from sample A to C obviously suggests a decreased density of acceptorlike defects and/or an increased density of donorlike defects.
B. Raman spectra
The Raman spectra were recorded at the range of 50–800 cm^{−1} at room temperature and the results are shown in Fig. 2. Aside from the vibration modes of sapphire at 379, 430, 450, 577, and 750 cm^{−1} (marked by “S” in Fig. 2), only ZnO E_{2} vibration modes were activated. The low-frequency E_{2} mode (E_{2}^{low}), located at about 99 cm^{−1}, is associated with the vibration of the heavy Zn sublattice and the high-frequency E_{2} mode (E_{2}^{high}), located at about 438 cm^{−1}, is mainly related to the O atoms [1]. Furthermore, there is no additional mode at about 275 cm^{−1} for all the samples. Some group thought the vibration mode at ∼275 cm^{−1} observed in N-doped ZnO materials is related to the Zn_{i} small clusters [26,27]. Therefore, the absence of this mode indicates that the Zn_{i} related clusters have been suppressed in our samples grown at O-rich condition. In this case, the Zn_{i} small clusters should not be responsible for the donors. Since there are not obvious vibration fingerprints related to nitrogen in the Raman spectra, and in order to check the nitrogen chemical states of our samples, we employed XPS.
C. XPS results
Figure 3 presents the XPS spectra and the Zn LMM Auger electron spectra (AES) of the samples. As shown in Fig. 3(a), all the Zn 2p spectra have the same shape and the binding energies of Zn 2p_{3/2} and Zn 2p_{1/2} are at ∼1021.1 eV and ∼1044.2 eV, respectively. The Zn LMM AES shows two Auger peaks centered at ∼497.73 and 494.33 eV, respectively. The peak at higher energy is related to the Zn-O bond of the ZnO lattice and the one at lower energy is related to the isolated Zn_{i} [28,29]. Although the Zn_{i} clusters have been suppressed as proven by the Raman spectra, the isolated Zn_{i} can still bind with the N_{O} to form stable Zn_{i}-N_{O} complex, acting as donors [30]. The O 1s spectra can be divided into two peaks. The one located at the lower-energy position (∼529.6 eV) is related to the oxygen in the lattice position of ZnO. The other one located at higher-energy (∼531.3 eV) level is related to the H-O or O-C surface adsorption [31,32].
The N 1s lines show three peaks located at 397.9, 399.7, and 402.5 eV. According to the XPS database of various materials containing nitrogen [33]. The binding energy of the N–N or N–O bonds, like nitrates, is always higher than 400 eV; the binding energy of N-H, like in ammonium is around 400 eV while the binding energy of anion-site nitrogen, like in nitrides is lower than 400 eV. Further referring to more literatures about nitrogen-doped ZnO [34], we have assigned these three peaks to N-N/N-O, N-H, and N-Zn bonds, respectively.
As can be seen, the N 1s XPS of all samples are dominated by the N-H component. XPS studies on NH_{x} species (x from 1 to 4) in ZnO have shown that N 1s binding energy typically increases by 1 eV when x is increased by 1 from the binding energy at about 398 eV. In this case, the relatively wider (∼2 eV) peak with position at about 399.7 eV indicates that the NH_{x} is the major configuration of the incorporated nitrogen and the NH_{3} has an overall majority. Compared with other molecular dopants, such as di-nitrogen on zinc site (N_{2})_{Zn} and nitrogen on oxygen site (N_{O}), the nitrogen binding with three hydrogen at zinc site (NH_{3})_{Zn} is thermodynamically the most stable defect under O-rich conditions [23]. Therefore, we believe that the NH_{x} complexes occupy zinc sites in our samples. An isolated NH_{3} molecule has two long-pair electrons in a nonbonding orbital and three bonding orbitals between N and H. The nonbonding orbital is higher than the bonding orbital in energy. Therefore, the NH_{3} has two valence electrons and isovalent with Zn. When the NH_{3} occupies zinc site, the NH_{3} can donate two long-pair electrons, binding with neighboring oxygen and filling the hole created by V_{Zn}, so the (NH_{3})_{Zn} is an neutral defects in ZnO and regardless of the Fermi level. The (NH_{3})_{Zn} can react with interstitial hydrogen (H_{i}) which exists in ZnO growth by MOCVD in a great amount. When the (NH_{3})_{Zn} reacts with H atom, the N–O bonds will break and the H atom will bind with N, forming the (NH_{4})_{Zn} defect. An isolated NH_{4} has four N–H bonding orbitals and an antibonding orbital occupied by one electron. When NH_{4} occupies zinc site, it can accept one electron, so the (NH_{4})_{Zn} behaves as a single acceptor [23]. However, the (NH_{3})_{Zn} can also dissociate into the (NH_{2})_{Zn} and (NH)_{Zn}. Analogous to (NH_{3})_{Zn} and (NH_{4})_{Zn}, it is easy to understand that the (NH_{2})_{Zn} and (NH)_{Zn} are single and double donor defects, respectively. However, the probability for the (NH_{3})_{Zn} to lose hydrogen, forming (NH_{2})_{Zn} and (NH)_{Zn}, is a relatively small number. As a result, we indicate that the (NH_{x})_{Zn} complexes exist mainly in the form of neutral (NH_{3})_{Zn} and acceptorlike (NH_{4})_{Zn}. The amount of (NH_{2})_{Zn} and (NH)_{Zn} should be relatively less, and their contribution to the conductivity could be almost neglected.
Apart from the N-H component, the N-N/N-O component emerges for sample A as compared to samples B–D. Obviously, the N_{2} can stay on oxygen site, zinc site, and the interstitial site. For the electrical activity, the N_{2} at oxygen site [(N_{2})_{O}] is a shallow double donor [35]; the N_{2} at zinc site [(N_{2})_{Zn}] is a shallow double acceptor [24] while the interstitial N_{2} [(N_{2})_{i}] is neutral [36]. From the Hall results, we observe that the electron concentration increases about 2 orders of magnitude (from 10^{17} to 10^{19} cm^{−3}) from sample A to B. The change of the electron concentration might be related to the disappearance of the N-N/N-O XPS peak from samples A to B. Assuming that the main form of the N_{2} complexes staying on oxygen or interstitial sites, sample A cannot have the lowest electron concentration. Also, although samples A was fabricated under the lowest oxygen pressure among the current batch of samples, it is still regarded as an “oxygen-rich” condition. Under such a high oxygen pressure, the formation of (N_{2})_{Zn} is thought to be much easier than those of (N_{2})_{O} and (N_{2})_{i}. Besides, the common peak position for (N_{2})_{O} is slightly higher at 404.5 eV, rather than the value observed in Fig. 3(d) [34]. We thus believe that the N_{2} molecule should stay at zinc site, forming (N_{2})_{Zn} complex shallow acceptor, giving the N 1s XPS peak at 402.5 eV. Actually, as can be seen from EPR measurement shown in Fig. 4, there is a peak at around g ∼ 2.02 for all the samples, which is ascribed to be related to the zinc vacancies. The prominent signal related to zinc vacancies and no obvious signal related to oxygen vacancies (g ∼ 1.99) could be detected [37]. This result is consistent with our conclusion that the zinc vacancies are abundant in our samples grown under oxygen-rich growth condition, providing plenty of vacant sites for the (NH_{4}) and (N_{2}) to occupy.
It is a little difficult to understand the coexistence of the (N_{2})_{Zn} and (NH_{x})_{Zn} complexes in our sample A because the formation energy of the (N_{2})_{Zn} is much higher than that of (NH_{3})_{Zn}, about 4 eV, even in O-rich growth condition [23]. We think that the existence of (N_{2})_{Zn} should be partially caused by the nitrogen doing source, i.e., the N_{2}O plasma. The energy of the RF source can completely break the N–N and N–O bonds of N_{2}O, but the growth process does not happen within the plasma region. That means, when the nitrogen ions get out of the plasma region, they can combine to form the N_{2} molecules again with a high rate. In this case, the N_{2} molecules can directly incorporate into ZnO, forming the (N_{2})_{Zn} complexes. Ton-That et_al [24] has proposed another forming dynamics of the (N_{2})_{Zn} that two metastable No acceptors migrate to a zinc site. The N_{O} is metastable due to an excess energy in the N bound to the surrounding Zn atoms, leading to the migration of N from N_{O} and the attraction of a second N atom. From N 1s spectra, the clear N-Zn components indicate the existence of the N_{O} defects. Therefore, the process proposed by Ton-That et_al can also happen in sample A.
Considering that the relative area ratio of the components could be an indication of the content of the responsible complex or defect, we have extracted the areas of the components and have normalized their intensities to the Zn 2p_{3/2} peak area for comparison. The area ratio of each component has been drawn in Fig. 5. As we increase the O_{2} flux in the growth process, the contents of Zn_{i} and N_{O} are basically unchanged, indicating that extra O_{2} cannot suppress the Zn_{i} and N_{O} completely probably due to the formation of the stable Zn_{i}-N_{O} complex. Moreover, the contents of the (NH_{x})_{Zn} and (N_{2})_{Zn} complexes decrease, indicating that surplus O will obstruct the N elements doping into ZnO. The content of oxygen increases monotonically, which is quite easy to understand that the amount of oxygen in gas is increased.
In fact, the relative nitrogen/oxygen ratio decreases from samples A to D. As a result, it is easy to see that the contents of the (NH_{x})_{Zn} and (N_{2})_{Zn} decrease. Considering that the growth condition for sample A is already treated as O-rich atmosphere, the (N_{2})_{Zn} and (NH_{4})_{Zn} may have a possibility to form. It is due to the existence of these nitrogen related acceptorlike complexes, the electron concentration for sample A is the lowest among the four samples. As the O_{2} flux increases to 130 SCCM (sample B), the content of the (N_{2})_{Zn} sharply decreases below the detection limit possibly due to the relatively high formation energy, which reduces the possibility of two N_{O} to combine. This also indicates that the formation window for the (N_{2})_{Zn} is rather narrow. The content of the (NH_{x})_{Zn} slightly decreases, which could be understood by the fact that more oxygen would consume hydrogen, making the possibility of forming the (NH_{4})_{Zn} complex decreases further. Therefore, the electron concentration increases. When the O_{2} flux increases to 160 SCCM (sample C), the content of the (NH_{x})_{Zn} would further decrease making the electron concentration increases accordingly. When the O_{2} finally increases to 250 SCCM (sample D), although the content of the (NH_{4})_{Zn} decreases, the electron concentration decreases as well. This implies the formation of acceptors and suppression of donors again. More importantly, the deep acceptor O_{i} and/or O_{Zn} would form at such a high O partial pressure. In this case, it is not difficult to understand the slight decrease of the electron concentration from samples C to D. However, we have to say that the conduction type is determined by the background electron, possibility originated from interstitial zinc and residual hydrogen etc. But the tuned contents of the (NH_{4})_{Zn}, (N_{2})_{Zn}, and O_{i} with oxygen pressure leads to the variation of the carrier concentration.
D. Photoluminescence spectra
Figure 6 shows the low temperature (13 K) PL spectra of all samples. The spectra are dominated by emissions from bound excitons (BE). Four peaks could be deconvoluted from the original data (labeled as P_{1} to P_{4}). The peak position of P_{1} is at about 3.364 eV, and it is attributed to the excitons bound to shallow donors (D^{0}X). Considering the energy position of a FX at low temperature to be approximately 3.375 eV and the Haynes rule for n-type ZnO [5,38], the energy level is estimated to be ∼30 meV, which is consistent with Zn_{i} (Ref [39]) or hydrogen [40].
The energy position of P_{2} is at about 3.350 eV, and it should be attributed to excitons bound to shallow acceptors (A^{0}X). Utilizing the Haynes rule [5], this acceptor state has been estimated to be ∼250 meV, which fits perfectly with the shallow acceptor level in N-doping ZnO [41]. For our case, we assign this shallow state to the zinc-site nitrogen complex acceptors. However, the energy level of the (N_{2})_{Zn} and (NH_{4})_{Zn} can change from 0.18 to 1.42 eV by using different calculation methods and their energy levels are close to each other [23], so we cannot distinguish the contribution from the (N_{2})_{Zn} and (NH_{4})_{Zn} based on the calculation results and we thus suppose that the P_{2} is attributed to the combined contribution from excitons bound to both (N_{2})_{Zn} and (NH_{4})_{Zn}.
The P_{3} and P_{4} are located at lower photon energy positions. These two peaks should not be the two-electron satellites of the BE or the photon replica of the free excitons because of the intensity inconsistency. The origin of the P_{3} and P_{4} should also be BEs according to the temperature evolution of the intensity and position. The peak position of the P_{4} is about 3.303 eV at 13 K and again the ionization energy should be deeper than 0.7 eV. We assigned P_{4} to excitons bound to N_{O}, proving the deep nature of the isolated N_{O} acceptors [21]. The XPS results have shown that the content of No defects is nearly the same among samples, so we supposed that the peak area of the N_{O}-related emission (P_{4}) is basically unchanged from samples A to D.
The energy position of P_{3} is located at about 3.327 eV. As the formation of the O_{Zn} is rather high [42], the ionization energy of P_{3} is estimated to be ∼480 meV, which is close to the ionization energy of O_{i} [43,44], so we assign P_{3} to the excitons bound to O_{i}. To further prove that the origin of P_{3} is related to O_{i}, we have annealed sample A at 800 °C under the N_{2}O and N_{2} mixed ambience with different flux ratio (N_{2}O/N_{2} = 0/100, 25/75, 50/50, 100/0) for 5 min and the low temperature PL of the annealed samples are shown in Fig. 7. It is clear that the intensity of the peak at 3.327 eV increases with increasing the N_{2}O/N_{2} ratio (or say, oxygen partial pressure). In this case, the intensity of the peak at 3.327 eV is related to the O content. As the energy position of P_{3} is also at 3.327 eV, it would be reasonable to assume that the P_{3} is related to O and could be attributed to the O_{i} with similar energy level.
In fact, the intensity of P_{2} and P_{3} also supports the above attribution. After fitting all PL spectra with Gaussian function, we have extracted the area ratio of P_{2}/P_{4} and P_{3}/P_{4} and have plotted them as a function of O_{2} flux shown in Fig. 8. The ratio of P_{2}/P_{4} decreases with the O_{2} flux, double-confirming the assignment of P_{2} to the nitrogen complex acceptors. The ratio of P_{3}/P_{4} increases with the O_{2} flux, well accordance with the change in the oxygen content.
IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
In this article, experiments have been designed to artificially introduce the zinc-site nitrogen complex acceptors. A growth condition at which the zinc-site nitrogen complexes favor to form has been employed. According to the above results and discussion, we are able to conclude that the nitrogen complexes at zinc sites, possibly in the form of (NH_{x})_{Zn} and (N_{2})_{Zn}, have been observed. The content of such complexes could be roughly modulated by tuning the oxygen chemical potential in the growth ambience. Excessively high oxygen partial pressure is not beneficial to the formation of the complexes, and thus, the VI/II ratio window of introducing the nitrogen related complex acceptors, especially the (N_{2})_{Zn}, is quite narrow. The nitrogen complexes have been found to be electrically active, as evidenced by the changed carrier concentration with different content of the complexes. However, all the samples show n-type background conductivity, which possibly originates from the combined electrical contribution from the intrinsic donorlike defects like oxygen vacancies and the Zn_{i}-N_{O} complex, the unintentionally incorporated hydrogen.
