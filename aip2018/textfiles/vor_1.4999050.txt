Kinetic step-growth polymerization: A dissipative particle dynamics simulation study
Kinetic step-growth polymerization is studied by dissipative particle dynamics coupled with our previously developed reaction algorithm on a coarse-grained level. The simulation result proves that this step-growth polymerization obeys the second-order reaction kinetics. We apply this algorithm to study the step-growth polymerization using the subunits with different flexibilities or within confinement. Good agreement of the number fraction distributions with the Flory distribution is obtained, implying that this algorithm is reasonable to describe such a kind of step-growth polymerization. This algorithm can further supply a convenient platform for simulating typical step-growth polymerization in reactive polymer systems.
I. INTRODUCTION
In polymer chemistry, step-growth polymerization, or stepwise polymerization, is an important process of reacting molecules together to form polymer chains or even complex topological structures, in which bifunctional or multifunctional monomers react to form dimers, trimers, longer oligomers, and eventually long chain polymers [1–8]. Also, step-growth polymerization of supramolecules provides an efficient strategy for fabricating nanostructures with complex, ideal architecture [9–16]. Step-growth polymerization is an important reaction type in the synthesis process of polymer materials, including polyester, polyurethane, epoxy resin, and so on. Commonly there are two different functional groups at each end of the polymer chain, leading to the polymerization between these functional groups. Carothers and Flory developed a series of mathematical equations to describe the behavior of step-growth polymerization including kinetics and number fraction distribution, etc [17–20]. These functions were well accepted, with following independent derivations. For example, Kéki and co-workers modified the original polydispersity index (PDI) values in these equations at high conversions [21]. Besides, the modifications of the original number distributions to include the considerable formation of cyclic polymers had also been proposed [22,23]. Furthermore, the indicated linear increase of number average molecular weight with reaction time, however, had been demonstrated to fail at a high extent of reaction [24]. Nevertheless, Flory’s number fraction distribution is still considered as the classical description for step-growth polymerization.
Step-growth polymerization within nanoconfinement has become a hot topic in the past decade since it is known to greatly influence the properties of polymers. Polymerization in confined situations such as in nanoporous materials or organoclay substrates had been investigated a lot in recent years [25–29]. Ng and co-workers [29] indicated that the average molecular weight and molecular weight distribution of polymerization may be changed in mesoscopic hexagonally arranged linear silicate channels. Malvaldi et_al [25] investigated the diffusion-controlled step-growth polymerization of a linear polymer confined in nanoscopic slits by Monte Carlo simulation. However, they found that the molecular weight distribution of the system was only slightly affected by the confinement. In this work, we also construct a step-growth polymerization model in which the chains are immobilized on the substrate. The kinetics and number fraction distributions are investigated with confinement.
Computer simulation plays an important role in understanding the kinetics or chain architecture of the polymerization process, like free radical polymerization or step-growth polymerization. The coarse-grained models based on molecular dynamics are often utilized to describe the polymerization process [24,30–40]. How to match the kinetics and the statistics of step-growth polymerization with coarse-grained dynamics simulation is still a challenge [31]. Most available coarse-grained force fields are not able to treat bond breaking and bond formation which are important processes in a chemical reaction. To represent the polymerization process, i.e., the bond breaking or the bond formation process in coarse-grained simulation more accurately, researchers used their respective techniques to match the computer simulation with the practical chemical reactions. Farah and co-workers [32] and Perez and co-workers [33] both adopted the method that the active center is connected by the nearest unreacted bead. Instead of this “distance-based” protocol, many researchers [34–40] adopted a “probability-based” protocol. Because the polymerization reaction is very fast, the probability is reasonable to be used to judge if the bond formation or breaking will take place in one time step.
In this study, as an application of our previous strategy [31], we couple the kinetic step-growth polymerization model with the dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulation to describe a specific step-growth polymerization process in reactive polymer systems at the coarse-grained level. This model involves the chemical details in the generic step-growth polymerization protocol, e.g., the activation energy, so that the impediment to reaction can be reflected. It describes a step-growth process with a constant Arrhenius-type reaction rate coefficient; thus, correct reaction kinetics is reproduced. Like our previous strategy for chain growth polymerization [31], this algorithm can also describe both gradual and jump processes of bond formation; thus, it encompasses several kinds of previous coarse-graining models. Generally speaking, the different length and time scales between the computer simulation and the real experiment leads to a challenge for the simulation to match them. For the simulation time scale, it is extremely shorter than that in the practical experiment. Lísal et_al [41,42] had made pioneering work on this issue, in which they developed a reaction ensemble DPD method to govern the time evolution of the reaction system on the mesoscopic scale. Likewise, our model is facile to make this balance, i.e., a large bond order formation time t_{bond} can be set and a gradual bond formation process is described. As an application, we focus on the generic one-dimensional linear step-growth of polymerization. The correct Flory-form number fraction distribution can be well reproduced by our model. Furthermore, step-growth polymerization with the subunits of different flexibilities or within confinement is also investigated. We believe that this model can supply a convenient platform for simulating typical step-growth polymerization in reactive polymer systems.
II. METHOD AND MODEL
A. Dissipative particle dynamics
In the dissipative particle dynamics method, the time evolution of the interacting particles is governed by Newton’s equations of motion [43]. The total force between a particle i and a particle j is characterized by pairwise conservative FijC, dissipative FijD, and random forces FijR. They are given by
where the interparticle distance is r_{ij} = r_{i} − r_{j}, r_{ij} = |r_{ij}|, and e_{ij} = r_{ij}/r_{ij} and the relative velocity between i and j particles is v_{ij} = v_{i} − v_{j} with v_{i} and v_{j} being the velocities of particles i and j. ξ_{ij} is a random number with zero mean and unit variance. α_{ij} is the repulsion strength, which takes the value of 25 for particles of the same kind in our simulations [43].α_{ij} between differing species is often set as larger than 25, representing the degree of compatibility between them. In this study, we set the particle number density as ρ = 3.0/σ^{3}. Thus the relationship between α_{ij} and the Flory-Huggins parameter χ can be empirically written as [44]
ω^{C}(r_{ij})=1−r_{ij} for r_{ij} < 1 and ω^{C}(r_{ij})=0 for r_{ij} ≥ 1 such that the conservative forces are soft and repulsive. The weight functions ω^{D}(r_{ij}) and ω^{R}(r_{ij}) of the dissipative and random forces couple together to form a thermostat. Español and Warren [45] showed the correct relations between the two functions,
where σ and γ are the two multiplicative constants which are related by the absolute temperature T and k_{B} is the Boltzmann constant. Here we use the simple choice of ω^{D}r due to Groot and Warren [43],
It should be noted that the choice of ω(r_{ij}) is not unique and is the simplest form adopted here because of its common usage in roughly all published studies.
A modified version of the velocity Verlet algorithm, GW-VV algorithm [43,44], is used for numerical integration in our work,
f_{i} means the resultant force from all the other particles in the interaction radius on particle i. The incoming parameter ṽ{i} is a prediction for the new velocity, which is proposed at first and is corrected afterwards in the last step. We choose λ = 0.65 and Δt = 0.02 here according to Ref [44]. We choose the radius of interaction, the particle mass, and the temperature as r_{c} = m = kT = 1. Polymers are constructed by connecting the neighboring beads together via the harmonic springs FiS = ∑_{j}Cr_{ij}. We choose the spring constant C = 10 according to Ref [44].
B. Step-growth polymerization protocol
For deriving the present protocol of step-growth polymerization, we basically follow the algorithm which we developed for the simulation of kinetic chain growth radical polymerization [31]. The reaction process between a specific pair of beads is decomposed into three consecutive steps, i.e., capture, decision, and bond formation. In the capture step, the closest free monomer in the capture radius will be considered as the reactive candidate for the active end. It implies that we focus on those reactive pairs which are most likely to overcome the reaction energy barrier. In the following decision step, we introduce the concept of reaction probability P_{r} to decide whether the reaction ultimately takes place between the designated pair of beads in the capture process. For a specific pair, a random number ξ [distributed uniformly in (0, 1)] will be generated. For ξ < P_{r}, the pair is regarded as reacted and then delivered to the following “bond formation” step; otherwise, they will be “unlocked” and put back to the reactive pool for possible future reactions. Here P_{r} should be set smaller than 1.0 so that this step-growth polymerization is slow and has controllability. By the aforementioned algorithm, we can reasonably describe an irreversible step-growth polymerization process.
Following our previous algorithm [31], we bridge the connection of the reaction probability with specific chemical quantities so that the impediment to the reaction can be partially reflected. Our ansatz connects the reaction probability P_{r} to the activation energy. According to Ref [31],
where [M_{0}] denotes the initial monomer concentration at the beginning of polymerization, while [M](t) is the instantaneous concentration at a specific time t during the polymerization. A represents the modifying factor, and E_{a} is the activation energy of this reaction. For calibrating the reaction probability of the fast radical polymerization reaction to P_{r}(0) = 1 (so that it is distinguishable to other slower reactions), we adopt a worst-case scenario for the radical polymerization reaction (the lowest temperature is 323 K, and the highest activation energy is E_{a} = 33 kJ/mol) [31]. Then we can obtain an estimate of the dimensionless modifying factor as A = 2.2 × 10^{5}. Thus Ea0=33 kJ/mol is defined as a critical value to distinguish fast and slow reactions. The physical meaning of P_{r} has been discussed in detail in Ref [31].
This decision process between the reactive i and j bead pair can be simply described by the following function which is evaluated at the specific reaction time t_{r},
As a generic study, we simply assume that this specific step-growth polymerization takes place with a common temperature of 150 °C. We also define its activation energy as E_{a} = 65 kJ/mol (E_{a}>Ea0) so that a rescaled initial reaction probability P_{r}(0) = 0.002 is obtained. Regarding the bond formation, for any specific time t during this process, the bonded potential can be described as [31]
where UijB_{0} is the full description of the bonded potential between i and j when the bond is completely formed. t_{bond} is defined as the time for a complete formation of the bond order [31]. During the bond formation process starting at time t_{r} between the two beads i and j, i.e., t_{r} ≤ t ≤ (t_{r} + t_{bond}), we assume δ_{ij}(t) = δ_{ij}(t_{r}) = 1. W(t) is a weight function with 0 ≤ W(t) ≤ 1, which is described as [31]
The motivation and rationality for adopting the above functions in this reaction model are described in detail in our previous paper [31].
For step-growth polymerization, taking the specific curing reaction between the typical epoxy resin and curing agent as an example [46], it is commonly expressed as
where C denotes the curing agent bead with the initial functionality ζ (commonly considered as including ζ numbers of reactive amino hydrogen atoms), while the epoxy resin is expressed as P* − R − ⋯ where the epoxy group is included in the bead P*. This equation applies for 0 < m < ζ. For m = 0, it denotes that C is a new curing agent molecule with full numbers of reactive amino hydrogen atoms, i.e., C^{ζ}*, while for m = ζ, it denotes that C is a saturated curing agent without any reactive hydrogen atoms.
Assuming that the functionality ratio of the reactants is 1:1 (i.e., the molar ratio is 1:ζ) so that neither reactant is in excess, the concentration change of the epoxy group [P*] is
The activation energy of this kind of polymerization is commonly higher than that of radical polymerization, i.e., E_{a}>Ea0. Thus we get
where [P0*] denotes the initial concentration of the epoxy group. As compared with the chemical equation
we get
which is a constant Arrhenius-form reaction rate coefficient. The instantaneous concentration of the functional group in the curing agent can be derived from the consumption ratio of the epoxy groups, i.e.,
where [C0ζ*] is the initial concentration of the curing agent. For the system with ζ > 1, the step-growth polymerization definitely leads to a final network structure since each saturated reactive site with ζ > 1 plays as a cross-linking point, like the curing agent’s role in the reaction between it and the epoxy resin [46], whereas, for ζ = 1, the polymer chains can only keep linear growth all through the step-growth polymerization. In the following application of this model, we conduct a simple simulation system with the functionality ζ = 1 for both types of reactive groups.
C. Model construction
In this simulation, we study a uniform system consisting of one kind of subunit chains in solution. Each subunit chain is a linear oligomer, involving both kinds of functional groups at its two ends. Its linear topology is formed by connecting 5 coarse-grained particles linearly by harmonic bonds. As schematically shown in Fig. 1, for a specific subunit chain, the end green and yellow beads represent the functional A-type and B-type groups, respectively, while the three middle red beads are defined as C type, which are non-reactive. Notably, the A-type bead is defined as the reactive center to actively connect the B-type bead in the same or in another subunit chain. The A-type bead is centered with a green transparent sphere, which represents the region of reaction radius. The nearest yellow bead in the reaction radius will always be captured. Since we define the functionality value ζ = 1, any reactive bead can only be reacted for at most once; thus, only the linear polymer chains can be generated. The rest of the space in the box is filled with S-type solvent beads according to the number density ρ = 3.0/σ^{3} so that a solution environment is formed. Figure 1(a) shows the basic step-growth polymerization model with a flexible chain as the subunit (i.e., P11). We further study a nanorod system as shown in Fig. 1(b), in which we arrange these 5 beads in line and set as a rigid body [47] so that a nanorod-like subunit is generated (i.e., P12). We can further study the confined system of polymerization as shown in Fig. 1(c), i.e., we anchor a part of reactive A-type centers as sites on the bottom substrate, so that finally some of the grown linear chains are end-tethered (i.e., P21). These A-type sites are arranged regularly in both x and y directions on the substrate. As an extended study, the system with the subunits in P21 being replaced as nanorods is also investigated, i.e., system P22.
The simulation box is set as (30σ)^{3}. The parameter t_{bond} is set specifically as 0.002Δt. α_{AS} = α_{BS} = α_{CS} = 15 to make sure the polymer chains disperse well in the good solvent. The polymer flexibility can be easily adjusted by adding the angle potential U_{h–angle} between the neighboring three beads in the chain as
where k is the strength parameter and θ_{0} is the equilibrated bond angle which is set as 180°. We use a weak strength parameter k = 4 to simulate an ordinary polymer chain. The simulations are conducted in the canonical ensemble. After generating the initial configuration, 1.0 × 10^{5} step integrations are carried out to ensure that the system is well relaxed. After that, a period of 1.0 × 10^{6} steps of step-growth polymerization process is performed to collect the data. The time values in the following all denote simulation time units instead of time steps. Besides, it should be noted that for collecting enough data to make the weight distributions, we run 5 parallel samples for each system of P11 and P12 sets, while for P21 and P22 where chains are grafted on the flat substrate, for obtaining more samples, the substrate is designed as large as 40σ × 40σ but with adjustable simulation box height (to reach the same monomer concentration). Meanwhile we run 15 parallel samples for each system of P21 and P22 sets to get enough grafted chain samples since a part of the grafting sites is finally still unsaturated.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
As an application of this step-growth polymerization model, we construct four representative systems to validate our model and further study the characteristics of these reactions, as shown in Fig. 1. For a linear step-growth polymerization, the reaction can be typically described as ⋯ − R_{1} − A + B − R_{2} − ⋯ → ⋯ − R_{1} − A − B − R_{2} − ⋯; thus, both the concentrations of reactive A and B groups decay concurrently. This is a typical second-order reaction [24,48], i.e., it obeys the rule X¯=k_{p}c02t+1 in which X is the degree of polymerization (DP), k_{p} is the reaction rate constant, and c_{0} is the initial concentration of subunit chains (so the initial concentrations of both active A end group and B end group should also be c_{0} since each subunit involves one active A group and one active B group in our system). This law can be a good reference to validate our present step-growth polymerization model. In Fig. 2, the time evolutions of average degree of polymerization in system P11 with different initial concentrations of reactants are shown. Obviously, for the systems with the initial concentration of subunit chains from c_{0} = 0.1/ ∼ 0.4/σ^{3}, we can basically find a standard linear increase of the polymer DP with determined slope, which implies a constant relationship of X¯∼t, i.e., the second-order characteristics of this step-growth polymerization. Furthermore, we also find that as the initial reactant concentration c_{0} increases, the slope of the line also increases, which agrees with the rule as well. With a further validation, we plot the relationship (X¯−1)/c02∼t as shown in the subfigure of Fig. 2. Obviously, all plots can basically fit with the same slope, which again proves the determined relationship of X¯=k_{p}c02t+1 and the constant reaction rate coefficient k_{p} of this step-growth polymerization. A slight deviation of the plot c_{0} = 0.1/σ^{3} should be ascribed to the fact that the statistics of chains is based on a relatively smaller number of samples since with such low concentration of subunits, the total number of polymerized chains is also quite low. This result well proves that our model correctly reproduces the second-order reaction kinetics of this step-growth polymerization.
As we know, the Flory distribution well describes the number fraction distribution of linear polymerization in typical step-growth polymerization [49], which can be expressed as
where p denotes the extent of reaction, which means the ratio of the formed bonds’ number to the maximum possible bonds’ number in a reaction. X denotes the number of subunits per polymer chain at this reaction time. N_{X}/N denotes the number of X-mer N_{X} (polymer chain with X subunits) divided by the total number of chains N at this reaction time, which is between 0 and 1. So we can get the fraction of any chain length by this number fraction distribution equation. This Flory distribution for step-growth polymerization supplies a possible way to further validate our model.
We first focus on the system of basic linear step-growth polymerization, i.e., system P11, which is a free polymerization with the subunits as flexible or semi-flexible chains. As shown in Fig. 3, the rescaled number fraction distributions of the system with flexibility k = 4 at different stages are plotted. The extent of reaction p at each stage is labeled in Fig. 3, and the corresponding Flory distributions determined by each p value (solid line) are shown for comparison (for reaching an extremely high value of p like p = 0.984, a long simulation with 4 × 10^{5} time units is specially performed). Basically, it is clear that at different stages of polymerization, the number fraction distributions can well coincide with the Flory distribution. At the early stage of polymerization, the fraction of polymer chains with low DP is quite high. As the polymerization proceeds, the plot undergoes a moderate slope, which implies the general increase of DP for most polymers. For different stages with p = 0.24 to almost 1.0, the number fraction distribution basically obeys the Flory distribution all through the polymerization. It should be noted that the conversion value p in our study is reasonably detected from the simulation system before we make any comparison of weight distribution to the Flory distribution. With a further comparison of the number fraction distribution with the Flory distribution, we make the corresponding log-linear plot of Fig. 3(a), as shown in Fig. 3(b). Making the logarithmic y-axis of the number fraction distribution is quite helpful to visually check if the distribution can be accurately fitted on the Flory distribution since according to Eq. (17) the log-linear plot of the Flory distribution is linear with a determined slope of log(p). It should be noted that we basically run 5 to 15 parallel samples (dependent on the available number of candidate chains during polymerization) to obtain the enough number of chains for making the distribution. In Fig. 3(a), we collect the chains of all samples together to obtain one plot of distribution, while in Fig. 3(b), each individual sample is handled independently to get a distribution so that we can obtain an averaged distribution plot with the mean value and the error bar (the logarithmic error in relative error) at each point for reference. The following distribution plots of this paper are handled in the same way as otherwise indicated. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the number fraction distributions at each stage of polymerization basically obey the linear decay as depicted by the corresponding Flory distribution line, which further validates the conclusion by Fig. 3(a). It should be noted that the error bars of the points with higher X is obviously large. It is ascribed to the fact that the proportions of very long chains are quite low during the polymerization and the formations of the sparse long chains are greatly dependent on the kinetics of local reactions, which results in an expected bad statistics. This explanation also applies to the following other distribution figures as well as to the plot corresponding to the late stage of polymerization with very high p (e.g., p = 0.984) of Fig. 3(b) in which relatively fewer candidate chains are involved.
Intuitively, the intrinsic nature of the polymeric subunits, e.g., the flexibility, may influence the process of step-growth polymerization. By adjusting the strength parameter of the angle potential k (i.e., the bending constraint parameter), we can easily simulate different types of subunits with different flexibilities. Figure 4 shows the dependence of number fraction distribution with subunits of different flexibilities from k = 4 to k = 80, based on the same polymerization time of 5000 DPD time units. The comparison of Flory distribution plots, based on the practical p value in each system (calculated by the conversion, i.e., the ratio of reacted subunits to the initial feeding subunits), are also shown as comparison. By both the linear-linear and log-linear plot comparisons of Fig. 4, it is clear that for systems with different subunits, the number fraction distributions can generally coincide with their respective Flory distributions by each practical p value. This result implies that the nature of step-growth polymerization, i.e., its number fraction fitting on the Flory distribution, is independent on the flexibility of the subunit. On the other hand, it is easy to find that as the strength constraint parameter increases from 4 to 80, i.e., as the flexibility of the subunit decreases, the conversion of polymerization p monotonically increases from 0.42 to 0.75. Accordingly, it is apparent that for those with higher k values, the fraction of short chains with low DP is also low. This phenomenon may be ascribed to an enhanced depletion-like effect of the subunits with the increase of their rigidities. For relatively rigid subunits, they are more likely to show rod-like extending conformations. As a result, the active ends of the subunits are less affected by the volume exclusion from their parent subunits or other neighboring subunits, namely, the active ends are more likely to expose and contact with other ends. Therefore the ends of rigid subunits have relatively high frequencies to get close to each other and further polymerize. This effect leads to that rodlike subunits promote the conversion of the polymerization. Another possible reason is that a reaction may lead to fast rotation of the reacting strands, which further enhances collisions between active end groups on subunits. All cases with different flexible subunits match the Flory distribution well. It should be noted that with k ≥ 4 of this study, we mainly focus on the system with semi-flexible subunits, which corresponds to a large Kuhn length as compared to flexible subunits. It directly leads to a quite low probability of cycle formation. (The dependence of cycle proportion on k can be found in Fig. S1 of the supplementary material. With flexible subunits, the formation of cyclic chains, as high as 40%, can be observed.) Correction for cycle formation in an irreversible reaction is discussed in Ref [50]. More useful information on cycle formation during the step-growth polymerization can be found in Refs [51–53].
Recently, self-organization of modified nanoparticles or nanorods becomes a promising topic because it is an efficient strategy for producing nanostructures with complex and hierarchical architecture via the so-called supramolecular polymerization [13–16]. Previous studies include modifying the ends of nanorods on shape and chemical property and generating specific polymer topologies like star polymer or X-shaped polymer [14,54]. In the following, the step-growth polymerization of rod-like subunits (with an extremely high constraint parameter of angle potential) is specially investigated since this model is much suitable to describe the supramoleuclar polymerization of nanorods [15,16], as shown in system P12. Each nanorod can be represented by a linearly arranged 5-mer beads [as shown in Fig. 1(b)] with extremely large k or by grouping them as a rigid body with linear arrangement so that its backbone is rigid enough to represent a nanorod (in the following simulations, the latter strategy is practically adopted via the quaternion method [47,55,56]). In this study, a series of systems with different initial concentrations of nanorods are investigated. As a result, the conversion of nanorods during the polymerization is accordingly different based on the same polymerization time. Thus we compare the results by the same conversions of free nanorods. Figure 5 shows the number fraction distribution of the polymerized nanorods with different initial concentrations but the same conversion of nanorods during the polymerization (p = 0.65). With the linear-linear [Fig. 5(a)] and log-linear [Fig. 5(b)] plot comparisons, basically all systems still obey the Flory distribution, in agreement with the results of Liu et_al [14] and Zhuang et_al [13], in which they demonstrated, respectively, that the number fraction distribution of chains by supramolecular step-growth polymerization of nanorods or nanowires could obey the Flory distribution. We can find that as the nanorod concentration increases, the polymerization time used to reach the conversion p = 0.65 is accordingly shortened. However, the plots of all systems with the same conversion p = 0.65 can basically overlap with each other. Besides, the Flory distribution determined by p = 0.65 satisfactorily generalizes all the systems, implying that the number fraction distribution of nanorods during the polymerization is less affected by the initial concentration, instead, it always well obeys the Flory distribution. Notably, the points of high X in Fig. 5(b) obviously deviate from the linear line of the Flory distribution, which should be attributed to the bad statistics of long chains generated by diverse levels of step-growth polymerization because of the confinement of the substrate. As a generic model, this result reasonably validates the mass distribution in supramolecular polymerization of nanorods or nanowires in experiments [13,14]. It is also expected to be applied to predict the number fraction distributions in experimentally relevant step-growth polymerization based on different types of building blocks [57], e.g., nanocubes.
We have thereby proved that this model correctly describes the step-growth polymerization of polymeric subunits of different flexibilities. In most cases, this polymerization takes place in a free environment. For preparing special functional materials, the surface is often used to graft polymer chains, via techniques such as step-growth polymerization. Here we consider the confined step-growth polymerization in which the chains have a chance to connect with anchoring sites on the flat substrate, i.e., system P21. We first anchor the initiator sites (defined as A type) on the bottom substrate; then the step-growth polymerization takes place above the substrate, as shown in Fig. 1(c) (for all P21 and the following P22 systems, the site density is set as 0.25/σ^{2} on the substrate). Notably, it is possible that an already grown free long chain is then captured by the site and grafted on the substrate. Figure 6 shows the number fraction distributions of surface-grafted step-growth polymerization by subunits with different flexibilities, based on the same polymerization time t = 5000 DPD time units. As shown in Figs. 6(a) and 6(b), for the subunits with different flexibilities, k = 4–16, their number fraction distributions can still basically coincide with the Flory distribution obtained by the practical p values. Thus it can be concluded that with the confined grafting situation, the number fraction distribution of step-growth polymerization still obeys the Flory distribution and is less influenced by the subunit flexibility (notably, for very rigid subunits like k = 32, it deviates from the Flory distribution obviously, and it will be discussed later). On the other hand, with the present polymerization time, i.e., 5000 DPD time units, the polymerization conversion can be promoted by purely adopting more rigid subunits (by increasing k from 4 to 32, p is increased from 0.33 to 0.81). This result partially supports the conclusion obtained by Fig. 5, i.e., even in confined situations, the rigid subunits are easier to complete the step-growth polymerization.
Finally, we replace the subunits of P21 with extremely rigid nanorods (using the rigid body model as that in P12). The influence of the initial concentration of nanorods on the number fraction distribution is studied during the surface-grafted step-growth polymerization. Although the polymerization conditions are set the same, the conversions for the same polymerization time are obviously different. Thus we still compare the systems by setting the same target conversion p = 0.75 but different polymerization times. As shown in Fig. 7, with the increase of nanorod concentration, the polymerization time for reaching the target conversion decreases, which implies an accelerated reaction. Combining the data in Fig. 5, we can deliver a clear explanation on this point. It can be explained by the reaction equation as r_{p} = k_{p}[A][B], where [A] and [B] are the concentrations of both kinds of reactive ends of nanorods. Since one nanorod has one A and one B reactive end, we have both [A] ∼ c_{0} and [B] ∼ c_{0}. On the other hand, for the same conversion, t∼rp−1. Thus for systems with different nanorod concentrations c_{0} and c0′, we have t/t^{′}=(c0′/c0){2}. This result exactly reflects this relationship, which also supports that this reaction is with second-order kinetics. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 7(a) of the linear-linear plot and Fig. 7(b) of the log-linear plot, we find that for the same conversion p = 0.75, the deviation from the corresponding Flory distribution is obvious for all systems. Tracing back to k = 32 (also considered as very rigid subunit) in Fig. 6 which also deviates from the Flory distribution apparently, we can conclude that the Flory distribution is less enough to accurately predict the number fraction distribution when the surface-grafted step-growth polymerization takes place among very rigid subunits like nanorods. As compared to Fig. 5, this result may be attributed to the fact that both the situations of very rigid subunits and the flat substrate restrict the step-growth polymerization to serious location differences, which further leads to the obvious deviation from the Flory distribution.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
In this study, as an application of our previous strategy [31], we couple the kinetic step-growth polymerization model with the dissipative particle dynamics simulation to describe a specific step-growth polymerization process in reactive polymer systems at the coarse-grained level. Following our previous algorithm for chain growth, three consecutive processes, i.e., capture, decision, and bond formation processes, and their protocols are introduced in detail. A constant Arrhenius-type reaction rate coefficient is derived, implying that correct reaction kinetics can be reproduced. Subsequently, we apply this algorithm to study the step-growth polymerization using the subunits with different flexibilities or within confinement. Good agreement of the number fraction distributions with the Flory distribution is obtained, implying that this model is reasonable to describe such a kind of step-growth polymerization. Simulation results also show that the Flory distribution is less enough to accurately predict the number fraction distribution when the surface-grafted step-growth polymerization takes place among very rigid subunits like nanorods. This model can supply a convenient platform for simulating typical step-growth polymerization in reactive polymer systems.

The three middle red beads in each subunit represent the C-type non-reactive block. The transparent sphere represents the region of reaction radius for the center green bead. As shown in (a), the closest yellow bead is chosen as the “locked” candidate in the capture process. Whether the bond can be eventually formed is decided by the reaction probability P_{r}(t); (b) system P12. As compared to P11, the subunits are replaced as rigid chains, i.e., the 5 coarse-grained beads are linearly arranged and grouped as a rigid body. This model well represents the step-growth polymerization behavior of nanorods; (c) system P21. As compared to P11, a flat substrate with some of the anchoring A-type sites is added so that a part of the grown linear chains is end-tethered; (d) system P22. As compared to P21, the subunits are replaced as nanorods (the same as the subunits in P12).
FIG. 2. 
Time evolution of average degree of polymerization in system P11 with different initial concentrations of subunit chains. Initial concentrations of subunit chains c_{0} vary from 0.1/σ^{3} to 0.4/σ^{3}. The inset shows the rescaled plot of (X¯−1)/c02∼t.
FIG. 3. 
The number fraction distribution N_{X}/N at different stages of step-growth polymerization in system P11 with the subunits of flexibility k = 4. The corresponding solid lines are the comparisons of Flory distributions by the practical p values obtained in simulations of the same time. (a) is the linear-linear plot, and (b) is the corresponding log-linear plot with the same legend.
FIG. 4. 
The number fraction distribution N_{X}/N in system P11 with the subunits of different flexibilities, based on the same 5000 DPD time units of step-growth polymerization. The corresponding solid lines are the comparisons of Flory distributions by the practical p values obtained in simulations of the same time. (a) is the linear-linear plot, and (b) is the corresponding log-linear plot with the same legend.
FIG. 5. 
The number fraction distribution N_{X}/N in system P12 with different concentrations of nanorod subunits. With different polymerization times, they are able to reach the same nanorod conversion, p = 0.65. The corresponding solid line is the comparison of the Flory distribution determined by p = 0.65. (a) is the linear-linear plot, and (b) is the corresponding log-linear plot with the same legend.
FIG. 6. 
The number fraction distribution N_{X}/N in system P21, i.e., the surface-grafted step-growth polymerization, with the subunits of different flexibilities, based on the same 5000 DPD time units of polymerization (only the surface-grafted chains are included in this figure). The corresponding solid lines are the comparison of Flory distributions determined by the practical p values obtained in simulations of the same time. (a) is the linear-linear plot, and (b) is the corresponding log-linear plot with the same legend.
FIG. 7. 
The number fraction distribution N_{X}/N in system P22 with different concentrations of nanorod subunits. With different polymerization times, they are able to reach the same nanorod conversion p = 0.75 (only the surface-grafted nanorods are included in this figure). The corresponding solid line is the comparison of the Flory distribution determined by p = 0.75. (a) is the linear-linear plot, and (b) is the corresponding log-linear plot with the same legend.
