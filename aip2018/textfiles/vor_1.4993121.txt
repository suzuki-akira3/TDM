Simultaneous high-pressure high-temperature elastic velocity measurement system up to 27 GPa and 1873 K using ultrasonic and synchrotron X-ray techniques
A new pulse-echo interferometry system has been developed for measurements of sound velocity at simultaneous high pressure and temperature corresponding to those of the Earth’s lower mantle, using synchrotron X-ray techniques at SPring-8. A combination of a low-noise high-frequency amplifier and a high-speed solid-state relay system allowed us to clearly detect the ultrasonic echoes of a small sample (<1.0 mm in diameter and length) in multi-anvil apparatus. A new high-pressure cell has also been introduced for precise measurement of the length of the tiny sample by X-ray radiography imaging under very high pressure and temperature. The new system was tested by measuring elastic velocities of α-Al_{2}O_{3} over wide pressure and temperature ranges of up to 27 GPa and 1873 K, respectively. The resultant adiabatic bulk modulus, shear modulus, and pressure and temperature derivatives of α-Al_{2}O_{3} are K_{0S} = 251.2 (18) GPa, ∂K_{S}/∂P = 4.21 (10), ∂K_{S}/∂T = −0.025 (1), G = 164.1 (7), ∂G/∂P = 1.59 (3), ∂G/∂T = −0.021 (1). These values are consistent with those previously reported based on experiments at high temperatures at ambient pressure and high pressures at room temperature. The present system allows precise measurements of the elastic velocities of minerals under the pressures and temperatures corresponding to the lower mantle for the first time, which should greatly contribute to our understanding of mineralogy of the whole mantle.
I. INTRODUCTION
The Earth’s interior is composed of layered spherical shells. Layering of the Earth has been indirectly inferred from the time of travel of refracted and reflected seismic waves created by earthquakes. Laboratory measurements of the elastic wave velocities of high-pressure minerals provide important data for estimating the composition of the deep mantle from velocity profiles of seismological observations. The pressure range 23–135 GPa is equivalent to the lower mantle which accounts for over 60 vol. % of the Earth’s entire volume. Thus, it is important to understand the high pressure and high temperature elastic properties of the major lower mantle constituent minerals [i.e., MgSiO_{3} and CaSiO_{3}-rich perovskites and (Mg, Fe)O periclase] for fundamental studies of the geochemical and geophysical behavior of the Earth.
Direct acoustic measurements of the elastic properties under high pressure have been attempted using techniques that include ultrasonic measurements in liquid-medium apparatus [1], in piston-cylinder apparatus [2], and in Kawai-type multi anvil apparatus (KMA) [3], resonant ultrasonic spectroscopy in gas apparatus [4], and Brillouin scattering in a diamond anvil cell (DAC) [5]. However, only Kawai-type multi-anvil apparatus (KMA) and diamond anvil cells can generate the high-pressure conditions greater than 23 GPa, which correspond to those of the lower mantle region [6,7]. Recent DAC studies combined with Brillouin spectroscopy enabled elastic velocity measurements over 100 GPa [8,9]. However, since the Brillouin spectrum of diamond (i.e., the diamond anvil) often obscures the sample signal, the majority of previous studies have only determined the shear wave velocity [8,9]. Furthermore, the Brillouin scattering method can be applied only to transparent samples and not applicable to colored minerals or metals. Also, a combination of a DAC and inelastic x-ray scattering techniques has also been developed by using the laser-heating diamond anvil cell [10]. This technique can measure both longitudinal and shear waves [11], but it is limited to low-accuracy estimations of the velocities from the phonon dispersive curve and phonon density of states [12]. On the other hand, the measureable sample in the combination of the KMA and ultrasonic method is without any restriction, and both longitudinal and shear wave velocities are observable under any condition. However, in order to generate the pressure corresponding to the lower mantle, the sample size must be significantly smaller than that of the previous study. Therefore, the intensity of ultrasonic echo is very weak and the travel time is short. As a result, the ultrasonic echoes at both ends of the sample were overlapped.
In order to obtain ultrasonic echoes from very small samples, we have developed advanced techniques of sound velocity measurements at simultaneous high pressure and temperature conditions, which consisted of a high frequency waveform generator, post-amplifier, and semiconductor high-speed relay, and we have also modified a high-pressure cell assembly for further high-pressure generation and high-resolution X-ray radiography observation.
In this study, α-Al_{2}O_{3} phase (alumina, space group R-3c) was used for the test sample. The alumina is stable up to 80 GPa and 2300 K and is suitable for the testing P-T conditions in this study [13,14]. Alumina is abundant on the Earth’s surface and a major component of subducted oceanic crust under the Earth’s lower mantle [15]. Thus, precise determination of the thermoelastic properties of alumina under high pressure and high temperature is important in the Earth sciences.
II. EXPERIMENTAL METHOD
A. Ultrasonic measurement system
Ultrasonic measurements under high pressure and high temperature were conducted at BL04B1 in SPring-8, with a 1500-ton KMA (SPEED-1500). The experimental setup and X-ray optics used in the present study have been previously described in Refs [16] and  [17]. White X-rays from a bending magnet light source were introduced to the sample via slits and the anvil gap. X-ray imaging or diffraction observations were performed at the same time as the ultrasonic measurements.
The travel time of acoustic waves through the sample was determined by a pulse echo overlap method. The ultrasonic transducer was used to generate and receive ultrasonic pulses. In this study, a high-frequency waveform generator (Tektronix AWG 710 B) was introduced to drive an ultrasonic transducer in high frequency and high voltage signals, enabling the generation of a high-frequency burst sine wave signal of 60–80 MHz range, and a low noise post-amplifier (Thamway T142-4029A) was also introduced to amplify the burst sine wave signal (2 Vpp: voltage peak to peak) from the high-frequency generator to 30 Vpp for generating powerful ultrasonic pulses. In previous studies, the transducer, digital oscilloscope, and waveform generator were connected directly (Fig. 1). The digital oscilloscope (Tektronix DPO 7104) was employed in this study. The withstand voltage of this oscilloscope is 5 Vpp in the low impedance mode (50 ℧), and the high impedance probe is usually used when measuring high voltage signals. In this study, the high impedance passive voltage probe (Tektronix P 6139 B) was used to attenuate the voltage to 1/10. On the other hand, the transmission velocity of the ultrasonic pulse was slower than that of the electric signal, requiring a ∼15-μs round trip propagation time in the WC anvil (26 mm^{3}) used in this study. This propagation time was slow enough compared with the switching speed of the semiconductor relay to enable separation of the high voltage input signals and weak reflected ultrasonic signals. In this study, we have developed a signal separation device using a semiconductor relay in cooperation with Youth Engineering Co., Ltd., and conducted comparative experiments with this signal separator and conventional high impedance probe.
B. High pressure ultrasonic cell
A schematic illustration of the cell assembly used for the combined in situ X-ray and ultrasonic measurements is shown in Fig. 2. A TiB_{2}+hBN composite tube heater (EBN grade; Denka Co. Ltd.) was used in this study. This heater was capable of generating temperatures over 1500 K and because the heater comprises only light element, it is a favorable high-precision sample length measurement by X-ray radiography observations [18]. Alumina was often used for buffer rod materials, but in this study, the same material as samples cannot be used for buffer rods because of the impedance contrast required for ultrasonic reflection. A sintered fine-grain β-Si_{3}N_{4} (FCS60 Grade; Fuji Die Co. Ltd.) was used instead of an alumina buffer rod.
We used a pure polycrystalline alumina rod (General Electric (GE) brand Lucalox^{TM} Alumina), which had a bulk density of 3.972(2) g cm^{−3} (or 99.6% of the X-ray density of 3.986 g cm^{−3}). The same sample material was used in our earlier study at a pressure of 10 GPa at room temperature [19]. The polished surface of the sample was connected to a β-Si_{3}N_{4} buffer rod via a thin (2.5 μm) film of gold to improve mechanical coupling. A gold film was also placed at the end of the sample to allow the sample length to be measured by X-ray absorption imaging techniques. The end of the sample was connected with a KCl+MgO pressure marker through the gold film. The soft KCl contributes to improving the hydrostatic pressure of the sample and the pressure was estimated using the equation of state of MgO [20]. The temperature was measured with a W_{95}Re_{5}–W_{74}Re_{26} thermocouple, where the hot-junction was placed near the pressure marker.
In the present study, a hard 2nd stage tungsten carbide anvil (TF05 Grade; Fuji Die Co., Ltd., Young’s modulus: 610 GPa) with a truncated edge length of 3.0 mm was used to generate high pressures over 20 GPa. Dual-mode LiNbO_{3} transducers (10°-rotated Y-cut) were used to generate and measure both P and S acoustic waves. The transducer was placed on the truncated outside corner of one of the tungsten carbide anvils. The thickness and diameter of the transducer were 0.03 mm and 1.6 mm, respectively. The sample diameter was 1.0 mm, which is a quarter of the area used in our previous studies [16,17]. The amplitude of the ultrasonic echo is directly proportional to the cross-sectional area of the sample and, therefore, the ultrasonic echoes were weaker in these experiments. As mentioned earlier, we adopted a new ultrasonic measurement system to solve this problem.
III. RESULT AND DISCUSSION
Figure 3 shows the results of comparison of ultrasonic echoes on using the previous system [16,17] and new system (high speed relay) shown in Fig. 1. In previous systems,ultrasonic echo is weak because the input voltage is lower than other systems. On the other hand, although the echo intensity is strong in the system with the amplifier, the noise is higher in the system using the high impedance probe than that in the semiconductor relay system (Fig. 4). This electrical noise is due to impedance mismatch between the coaxial line and oscilloscope, and the semiconductor relay system terminated to 50 ℧ is capable of observing ultrasonic echoes with high S/N ratio. From these results, a high-pressure ultrasonic experiment was conducted using the ultrasonic measurement system with the semiconductor relay (Fig. 5).
We first compressed the sample to the target press load and then raised the temperature to 1273–1873 K at a fixed press load to reduce the stress imposed on the sample uponcompression. We then measured the ultrasonic travel time, sample length, and X-ray diffraction from both the sample and the pressure marker. The measurements were performed every 200 K as the temperature was decreased to room temperature. The temperature gradient in the sample was estimated by the equation of state [21] of sample Al_{2}O_{3}, assuming that the pressure in the sample is constant. X-ray diffraction data were measured at several points in the sample, and the temperature gradient in the sample was estimated to be below 100 K at 1673 K.
We conducted the ultrasonic in situ experiments twice and acquired five series of data from different press loads. Full details of the experimental procedure are described in Refs [16] and  [17].
We observed echo signals for P- and S-waves for almost all P, T conditions in this experiment. The buffer rod (β-Si_{3}N_{4}) has a very high compressive strength but transforms to a c-Si_{3}N_{4} phase over 15 GPa [22]. We were concerned about the adverse effects on ultrasonic waveforms due to the phase transition of the Si_{3}N_{4} buffer rod, but the experimental results showed no clear effect. Figure 6 shows the changes in ultrasonic echoes at high temperature. The echoes’ position on the front and end surface of the sample was changed with the phase transition of the buffer rod material, but there was no significant change in the echoes’ intensity of the sample, and the travel time measurement of the sample was not affected.
Figure 7 shows X-ray radiography images under compression. In this study, only gold foils at both ends of the sample could be confirmed, and the shape of the sample end surface was clearly observed. Figure 8 shows the change of sample length obtained by image analysis of the X-ray radiography images. The details of the image analysis are described in Ref [17]. The sample length was successfully measured with the accuracy within 0.5% under all temperature and pressure conditions by the clear X-ray absorption image.
However, we were not able to estimate the S-wave travel times for several P, T conditions due to the small difference in acoustic impedance of S-waves between the buffer rod and sample occurring at almost the same pressure and temperature of approximately 21–17 GPa and 1873–873 K, respectively. An example of such a signal was observed at the highest pressure of ∼27 GPa at 300 K, as shown in Fig. 3. Echoes and secondary echoes from the interfaces between the anvil and buffer rod, buffer rod and sample, and sample and pressure marker were clearly observed. The ultrasonic travel times passing through the sample were precisely determined for the P- and S-waves even under high pressure and high temperature conditions. The P- and S-wave velocities were calculated from the sample length divided by the travel time. The effect of small change of travel time induced by the thin gold foil inserted between the buffer rod and sample was also considered in the calculations [17,23]. The lattice parameters and density of alumina were also determined at various pressures and temperatures by in situ X-ray diffraction measurements (Table I).
Figure 9 shows the changes of P- and S-wave velocities for alumina with pressure and temperature, as determined in the present study and compared with the previous results in the figure. The present P- and S-wave velocity data covered1t a wider range P-T conditions than those of previous study. The data at 300 K showed good agreement with the results of Gieske and Barsch, Kung et_al, and Higo et_al [19,24,25] within experimental uncertainty.
The longitudinal (L) and shear (G) moduli for alumina at high pressure and high temperature are shown in Fig. 10. These data were derived from the velocity data in Fig. 9 and the densities were determined from the unit-cell volume data at a given pressure and temperature. The data were fitted in line by the following relation [16]:M = M_{0} + ∂M/∂P*P + ∂M/∂T*(T − T_{0}), in which M stands for the elastic longitudinal elastic moduli (L) or shear elastic moduli (G), and the subscript 0 denotes ambient conditions. In this study, the temperature derivatives of the elastic moduli were determined from the whole data set. The bulk modulus (K) was calculated from the relationship K = L − (4/3) × G.
As a result, we obtained the following elastic parameters for α-Al_{2}O_{3} alumina: K_{0S} = 251.2 (18) GPa, ∂K_{S}/∂P = 4.21 (10), ∂K_{S}/∂T = −0.025 (1) GPa/K, G_{0} = 164.1 (7) GPa, ∂G/∂P = 1.59 (3), ∂G/∂T = −0.021 (1) GPa/K (Table II). Early measurements of the pressure dependence of the elastic constants of alumina were conducted using gas apparatus combined with extended ultrasonic interferometry measurements to 1 GPa [24–26]. High-pressure measurements (∼10 GPa) have been performed on large volume multi-anvil apparatus with ultrasonic methods [19,27]. The temperature dependence of the elastic properties of alumina have been measured by the rectangular parallelepiped resonance technique [28] in the range 300–1800 K and Brillouin scattering [29,30] in the range 300–2100 K. There have been few examples of simultaneous high pressure and high temperature measurements of elastic wave velocities at the limited pressures and temperatures (up to 0.3 GPa and 800 K, respectively) [31]. The results of this study show good agreement with those of previous studies, which were conducted under substantially lower pressure conditions of below9t∼10 GPa. However, our measured pressure dependence of the shear modulus (∂G/∂P) was slightly smaller than previously reported values. The small difference of the ∂G/∂P value may have been caused by different fitting equations used in those studies. Here we determined the elastic moduli with a polynomial expression for elastic velocity and a pressure value based on a pressure standard material in this study, whereas previous studies without in situ X-ray measurements indirectly evaluated the pressures using a finite-strain equation of state of the sample in the smaller pressure ranges.
The overall consistency between our experimental results and those of the earlier studies validates the present approach of elastic velocity measurement and provides precise elastic properties of α-Al_{2}O_{3} alumina. Alumina is often used as a standard and construction material for high-pressure experiments. Thus, these new experimental data should be useful for future high-pressure investigations. Recently, successful pressure generation to 50 GPa was reported using new binderless ultrahard tungsten anvils [32]. A combination of the newly developed ultrasonic measurement system with the new ultra-hard tungsten anvils should lead to the elastic velocity measurements under the pressures corresponding to the deeper regions of the Earth’s lower mantle.
