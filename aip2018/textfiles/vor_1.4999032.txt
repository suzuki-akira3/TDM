Investigating the electrical conduction and relaxation phenomena in rare earth erbium doped lead free 0.94Na_{0.5}Bi_{0.5}TiO_{3}-0.06BaTiO_{3} by impedance spectroscopy
Rare earth erbium (Er^{3+}) doped 0.94Na_{0.5}Bi_{0.5}TiO_{3}-0.06BaTiO_{3} (NBT-6BT) was prepared via a solid state synthesis route as per the nominal formula 0.94Na_{0.5}Bi_{0.5-x}Er_{x}TiO_{3}-0.06BaTiO_{3} (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.05). Detailed impedance spectroscopy studies, invoking complex impedance and modulus formalisms, were carried out in order to investigate the influence of erbium doping on the long range electrical conduction and localized relaxation in the system. Our results suggest that a low concentration (x = 0.005) of rare earth doping significantly reduces the long range ionic conductivity (with respect to the undoped NBT-6BT value) and decreases the local relaxation, making the system electrically homogeneous. At a higher doping concentration (x ≥ 0.01), enhancement in the electrical conductivity occurs and local relaxation increases in the system. Observed trends are rationalized on the basis of a model, which hypothesizes phase segregation at a higher concentration of Er-doping. Such segregation leads to the formation of pure NBT-6BT regions and Er-saturated phase with probable dissimilar polar symmetry compared to that of NBT-6BT. A possible correlation between grain size, electrical conductivity, activation energy of conductivity, and local relaxation is indicated.
I. INTRODUCTION
Impedance spectroscopy (IS) is a powerful tool to characterize the dielectric and electrical conductivity behaviour of a wide class of materials [1]. In this technique, a small amplitude AC signal with a wide frequency range (typically 10^{−2} to 10^{7} Hz) is utilized. The electrical response of different electroactive components of a specimen can be probed by this measurement based on their characteristic relaxation times or time constants [2]. The IS data can be analysed by four complex formalisms: impedance formalism (Z*), modulus formalism (M*), admittance formalism (Y*), and permittivity (ε*) formalism. The interrelationship among those formalisms is [3]
where ω = 2πf is the angular measurement frequency and C_{0} is the vacuum capacitance. Typically different regions of the material are characterized by modelling a resistance (R) and a capacitance (C) in parallel with time constant, τ = RC, and ω_{max}RC = 1, where ω_{max} is the maximum angular frequency.
The IS study of electroceramics has very much fundamental and technological relevance. One of the salient examples is the IS study of yttria-stabilized zirconia, 0.9ZrO_{2}-0.1Y_{2}O_{3} [4,5], used as an oxygen ion conducting membrane in solid oxide fuel cells and oxygen sensors. A complex impedance formalism in association with the complex modulus formalism explains the positive temperature coefficient of resistivity (PTCR) [6] of rare earth doped BaTiO_{3}, commercially utilized in thermal fuses and current overload protection devices. Recently, Li et_al [7] have shown an oxygen ionic conductivity of ∼0.01 S cm^{−1} in B-site Mg doped and bismuth deficient Na_{0.5}Bi_{0.5}TiO_{3} (NBT) lead free piezoelectric. The authors have suggested NBT based oxide ion conducting systems as a new class of promising oxide materials, future alternative electrolyte for solid oxide fuel cells to operate in the intermediate temperature range (500 °C–700 °C). They have shown the increased oxygen vacancy in such systems, associated with the Na^{+} and Bi^{3+} loss during high temperature sintering of the specimen. The conductivity manifests as the leakage current during ferroelectric and piezoelectric measurements and puts obstacles to achieve the desired properties. Therefore, it is important to understand the effects of Na^{+} and Bi^{3+} chemical stoichiometry on structural and electrical properties in the NBT based systems. Several reports have emerged with regard to the electrical conductivity studies of NBT based systems in the recent past. A decrease in the grain size, reduction of leakage current, enhancement of the piezoelectric coefficient (d_{33}), and reduction of the depolarization temperature (T_{d}) were reported in excess Bi content NBT [8]. On the other hand, excess Na in NBT is shown to increase the grain size and decrease d_{33} and T_{d} [9]. The influence of Na on the rhombohedral distortion in NBT is reported by Sung et_al [9] Wu et_al [10] have shown that the excess Na/K can improve the polarization and dielectric properties of (Na_{0.85}K_{0.15})_{0.5}Bi_{0.5}TiO_{3} ceramics due to the compensation of Na/K loss occurred during the sintering process. Qiao et_al [11] have shown larger oxygen ion conductivity in Bi-deficient 0.94Na_{0.5}Bi_{0.5}TiO_{3}-0.06BaTiO_{3}.
Attempts are made to decrease the oxygen ion conductivity/leakage current by donor (Nb, Ta) doping in NBT based systems in order to achieve better dielectric and piezoelectric properties [12–16]. Li et_al have shown a significant decrease in the oxygen ion conduction and hence reduction of leakage current in NBT by doping with donor Nb on the Ti-site [12]. Reduction in leakage current and improvement in the piezoelectric properties are observed in Nb doped (Na_{0.85}K_{0.15})_{0.5}Bi_{0.5}TiO_{3} [15]. While most of the reports discuss only about the dc electrical conductivity following the complex impedance formalism for NBT based systems, detailed studies of the correlations between defect concentrations, activation energy of electrical conduction, and heterogeneity in the local relaxation are still lacking in these systems. Combining the complex impedance (Z*) and complex modulus (M*) formalisms, here we report the study of these aspects in detail in the lead free relaxor ferroelectric 0.94Na_{0.5}Bi_{0.5}TiO_{3}-0.06BaTiO_{3} (NBT-6BT) doped with rare earth erbium (Er) at the Bi-site. In the process, we show that dilute doping of rare earth (∼0.5%) can significantly reduce the electrical conductivity in the system and improve the piezoelectric performances.
II. EXPERIMENTAL
Specimens of 0.94(Na_{0.5}Bi_{0.5-x}Er_{x}TiO_{3})-0.06BaTiO_{3} [NBT-6BT:xEr] (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.05) were prepared following the conventional solid state route by mixing stoichiometric ratios of dried Na_{2}CO_{3}, Bi_{2}O_{3}, TiO_{2}, Er_{2}O_{3}, and BaCO_{3} in an acetone medium using zirconia vials and balls in a planetary ball mill for 12 h. Calcination was carried out at 900 °C for 3 h. Green pellets were made applying a uniaxial pressure of 100 MPa and then subjecting them to cold isostatic pressing at 300 MPa. Pellets were sintered at 1150 °C for 3 h. A density measurement was carried out on the sintered pellets following the Archimedes method, and pellets were found to be ∼95% of theoretical density. X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) was carried out with Cu-Kα_{1} radiation using a Rigaku Smartlab X-Ray diffractometer with a power of 4.5 kW and a step size of 0.008° with the time duration of ∼2 h. Powders for XRD were prepared after gentle crushing and annealing (600 °C for 2 h) of as-sintered pellets. Morphological and phase analyses of all the compositions were carried out on the sintered surface of the pellets using a Quanta scanning electron microscope (SEM) supplied by FEI. Imaging was carried out by secondary electron (SE) and back scattered electron (BSE) modes. Image J software was utilized for particle size determination following the line section method. Histograms for grain size were determined using Origin software. A precision Premier II tester (Radiant Technology, Inc.) was used for the electric field dependent polarization (P-E) measurement on pellets. The direct piezoelectric coefficient d_{33} was measured on poled pellets using a Piezotest, PM300. The electric field dependent strain measurement was performed using an MTI-2100 photonic sensor attached to the radiant set-up. The impedance measurement was carried out using a Novocontrol impedance analyzer (Alpha-A) in an air medium in the frequency interval of 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz and in the temperature range of 250 °C–600 °C.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
A. Microstructural, Structural, and Piezoelectric properties
Figure 1 shows the SEM micrographs of different NBT-6BT:xEr compositions. The grain size distribution for different x is shown as insets. For x = 0.0, the average grain size is found to be 1.3 μm. Initially, the grain size slightly increases with an increase in the erbium concentration. For instance, for x = 0.005, the average grain size increases to 1.8 μm. A further increase in the erbium concentration leads to a decrease in the grain size. In NBT based systems, bismuth becomes volatile during high temperature sintering [7,11]. It creates vacant sites in the matrix, which might be helpful for easy diffusion of atoms [17]. Er^{3+} has a smaller ionic radius (0.88 Å) as compared with that of Bi^{3+} (0.96 Å), and therefore, the mass transport could easily occur through the vacant sites, causing slight enhancement in the grain size at a dilute concentration of erbium. However, as the erbium concentration increases, it saturates the matrix, and due to the low diffusivity of the rare earths, the grain growth becomes prohibited [18]. This might have led to the decrease in the grain size. For the highest dopant concentration x = 0.05, the average grain size reduced to 1.1 μm. It may be pointed out that at x = 0.0 and x = 0.05, the two extreme compositions have a similar grain size. However, their electrical behaviour is different as will be discussed later. The reduction of grain size with the increasing rare earth concentration is reported in other piezoceramics also [18–22]. Usually, the presence of a crystalline secondary phase is observed in a back scattered electron (BSE) mode of SEM. However, within the resolution limit of our instrument, we have not noticed any phase contrast for all the compositions. This is consistent with the presence of segregated nanoscale pure phase (if any) in the Er-saturated matrix, which is not detectable in high-resolution XRD and in the BSE mode in the SEM.
Figure 2 shows the powder XRD patterns of different NBT-6BT:xEr compositions. The similarity in the XRD patterns of all the doped compositions to that of undoped NBT-6BT suggests a single perovskite phase formation with rare earth doping. No detectable additional peaks corresponding to the secondary phase are observed even at the highest (x = 0.05) concentration of erbium doping in the matrix. This confirms the phase purity of the compositions and suggests that erbium has entered into the lattice. The electric field dependent bipolar polarization (P-E) measurement shows saturated hysteresis loops till x ≤ 0.02 [Fig. 3(a)]. However, a decrease in the remnant and maximum polarization occurs with a further increase in the Er concentration, suggesting a gradual destruction of ferroelectricity with the increasing dopant concentration. Consistent with this, the field dependent bipolar electrostrain also reduces abruptly with the increasing Er concentration [Fig. 3(b)]. Figure 3(c) shows the longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient (d_{33}) for different compositions poled at 55 kV/cm for 0.5 h. Initially, d_{33} increases from 123 to 134 pC/N for x = 0.005. A further increase in the Er concentration reduces d_{33}, reconfirming the loss of ferroelectricity with increasing Er-doping.
B. Long range electrical conductivity
Figure 4 shows the Cole-Cole plots [23] for the complex impedance (Z* = Z′ − jZ″) of different NBT-6BT:xEr compositions. Single semicircles are observed above the frequency 100 Hz at different temperatures. All the compositions show a negative temperature coefficient of resistivity (NTCR) in the temperature range (250 °C–600 °C) characterized by the enhancement of resistivity with decreasing temperature. The presence of single semicircle [in the frequency range of 100 Hz–1 MHz] characteristics of bulk response is observed for different compositions. A comparative Cole-Cole plot of different compositions reveals the lowest resistivity for x = 0.0 [Fig. 4(a)]. Composition x = 0.005 shows the largest resistivity or least conductivity. The semicircles can be fitted with a model of a parallel combination of a resistance (R_{b}) and a capacitance (C_{b}). The resultant complex impedance (Z* = Z′ − jZ″) for the above model can be expressed in its real (Z′) and imaginary (Z″) parts with the following relations:
Real and imaginary parts of the data can be fitted separately with the above equations, respectively. The grain resistance (R_{b}) is determined from the fitting. After obtaining the value of R_{b}, the dc conductivity is calculated at different temperatures. At 600 °C, the conductivity decreases by around one order for x = 0.005 with respect to the value obtained for x = 0.0 [Fig. 5(a)]. The activation energy associated with the dc conductivity of the grain was estimated using the Arrhenius equation, σ = (σ_{0}/T) exp(−E_{a}/kT), as shown in Fig. 5(b). The composition x = 0.0 shows the highest conductivity and the lowest activation energy (1.03 eV). This value is consistent with the value (1.05 eV) reported by Qiao et_al [11] for NBT-6BT. The authors have also reported enhanced oxygen ion conduction in the system. Lower activation energy and larger electrical conductivity in NBT based systems are attributed to the enhanced oxygen ion conduction through the defects created due to the loss of bismuth during high temperature sintering [7,11,24]. Composition x = 0.005 shows the highest activation energy (1.66 eV) and the lowest electrical conductivity among all the compositions. This value is consistent with the value obtained by Qiao et_al [11] for excess Bi doping in the NBT-6BT matrix. The electrical conduction process in this case is possibly electronic in nature. Such a dilute concentration of Er doping has significantly reduced the oxygen vacancy concentration and made the composition electrically insulating. The electrostrain and piezoelectric coefficient (d_{33}) are increased slightly for x = 0.005 as compared to the values obtained for x = 0.0 as shown in Figs. 3(b) and 3(c). These observations suggest that the dilute concentration of erbium doping can reduce the conductivity and increase the piezoelectric properties of NBT based systems, making it more useful for piezoelectric applications. Improvement in the ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties in 0.4% Nb doped (Na_{0.85}K_{0.15})_{0.5}Bi_{0.5}TiO_{3} is reported by Kumar and Kumar [15]. The authors have attributed this observation to the homogeneity in the domain formation in the system with the intermediate doping level. They have correlated the property improvement to the enhancement of the activation energy and the decrease in the electrical conductivity for the specimen. Li et_al [12] have also shown dramatic enhancement of activation energy and reduction in the conductivity of Nb doped NBT. They have observed a reduction of leakage current and slight improvement in the ferroelectric behaviour in NBT with 1% of Nb doping. The reduction of leakage current in NBT with Mn doping is reported by Ge et_al [25]
An anomaly in the activation energy across x = 0.005 is observed as below, and above this composition, the activation energy decreases as shown in Fig. 5(c). This observation is in agreement with the trend obtained by Kumar and Kumar [15] for Nb doped (Na_{0.85}K_{0.15})_{0.5}Bi_{0.5}TiO_{3}. The decrease in the activation energy [Fig. 5(c)] and enhancement of the conductivity [Fig. 5(a)] with the increasing erbium concentration (x = 0.05) might be associated with saturation in the matrix with a higher amount of the dopant concentration. Due to the low diffusivity of the rare earth, phase segregation might have occurred which led to the formation of pure NBT-6BT phase and Er-saturated phase regions. The fact that activation energy for x = 0.05 is 1.31 eV, which is the intermediate value compared with the values obtained for x = 0.0 and x = 0.005. This may suggest mixed conductivity (ionic and electronic) nature for the composition. This is more likely as the segregated pure phase has ionic conduction characteristics, while the Er-saturated phase (situation in x = 0.005) has electronic conductivity. The view of nanoscale phase segregation in a higher concentration of rare earth doping is supported by the work of Prusty et_al [26] The authors have shown similar mechanical properties for pure NBT and Eu-doped NBT (beyond 5% of Eu doping). The authors have attributed this observation to the nanoscale segregation of the pure NBT phase in the Eu-doped saturated matrix, which led to the enhancement of mechanical properties in the saturated Eu-doped NBT compositions. We also carried out complex impedance measurements at very low frequencies (down to 0.01 Hz) on x = 0.0 and 0.05 to capture the possibility of ionic conduction associated with Warburg diffusion [7] (Fig. 6). Both the compositions x = 0.0 and x =0.05 show additional arc of semicircles below 100 Hz [Figs. 6(a) and 6(b)]. This is in agreement with the observations of Li et_al [7] on NBT and seems to confirm the presence of oxygen ion conductivity in these compositions.
C. Localized relaxation study
Figures 7(a)–7(c) show the frequency dependent impedance (Z″) spectra for NBT-6BT:xEr compositions at different temperatures. As evident from the figures, the peak corresponding to the bulk response starts appearing above 300 °C for x = 0.0 and x = 0.05, while peaks start appearing above 400 °C for x = 0.005. The appearance of a peak at relatively high temperature for x = 0.005 is because of the electrically insulating nature of the composition as discussed earlier. The appearance of a shoulder in the permittivity (ε″(f)) spectra indicated by an arrow head at high frequency suggests the presence of polar nanoregions (PNRs) in the matrix [Figs. 7(d)–7(f)]. As evident from the figures, the shoulder vanishes above 300 °C for x = 0.0 and x = 0.005, while the shoulders sustain even beyond 500 °C for x = 0.05. This suggests the probable dissimilarity in the nature (structural symmetry) of PNRs for x = 0.05 as compared to x = 0.0 and x = 0.005. The presence of such a shoulder in these spectra has been reported earlier in NBT based systems [3,27]. The appearance of a shoulder is more prominent in the frequency dependent modulus (M″(f)) curves also [Figs. 7(g)–7(i)]. The complex modulus is sensitive to the local capacitance [2], which is associated with the presence of PNRs. The difference in the nature of frequency dispersion of modulus suggests the difference in the symmetry of the PNRs for x = 0.05 compared to x = 0.0 and x = 0.005. Frequency dependent normalized parameters are plotted in Figs. 7(j)–7(l). The peak of normalized M″ and Z″ coincided for x = 0.005, suggesting electrical homogeneity in this insulating composition, which exhibits high activation energy and lower electrical conductivity. On the other hand, those peaks are separated for x = 0.0 and x = 0.05, which show larger ionic conduction and lower activation energy. The peak separation is larger for x = 0.05, which indicates more heterogeneity in the electrical processes for this composition. Li et_al [12] have reported the coincidence of the peaks of those normalized parameters in 1% Nb doped NBT, which shows electrically insulating behaviour. The authors have suggested electrical homogeneity for the composition.
The complexity in the electrical processes is further confirmed by the temperature dependent scaling behaviour for the compositions shown in Fig. 8. Master curves are shown in the figure by plotting the normalized imaginary impedance (Z″/Z_{max}″) as a function of the logarithm of angular frequency (ω/ω_{max}) at different temperatures. Here, ω_{max} is the angular frequency corresponding to Z_{max}″. The master curves are falling on each other for x = 0.005, suggesting the temperature independent relaxation process for the composition [28,29]. This is consistent with the electrically insulating nature of the composition. On the other hand, for x = 0.0 and x = 0.05, master curves follow slightly different lines for different temperatures, and the width of the curves is larger as compared to that of x = 0.005, suggesting temperature dependent relaxation processes for those compositions.
Figure 9 shows most probable relaxation time (τ = 2π/ω_{max}) as a function of inverse temperature. Data are fitted with the Arrhenius equation, τ = τ_{0} exp (E_{a}/kT), where τ_{0} is the pre-exponential factor, E_{a} is the activation energy for the hopping process, and T is the temperature. Single activation energy is observed for x = 0.005 in the wide temperature range (300 °C–600 °C). On the other hand, for x = 0.0 and x = 0.05, two activation energies are observed. The change in the slope around 500 °C is associated with the destruction of PNRs and appearance of the non-polar phase. A similar observation is made by Singh et_al [30] for 0.9BiFeO_{3}-0.1BaTiO_{3}. The authors have shown the change in the slope at the Curie temperature for the system. It is interesting to note that single activation energy is found for x = 0.005, while there is a change in the activation energy for x = 0.0 and x = 0.05. This suggests that the relaxation of the polar phase is facilitated by the presence of point defects. Possibly, in the case of x = 0.005, polar phases continue to survive till very high temperature, as it could not relax in the electrically homogeneous matrix at an intermediate temperature (300 °C–600 °C). It will be interesting to see if the PNRs exist till sufficiently high temperature for x = 0.005. Very recently, Vögler et_al [31] have shown the existence of polar phases around 700 °C in NBT-6BT by the temperature dependent elastic modulus measurement. It will be interesting to study such a mechanical behaviour in these Er doped compositions at different temperatures. The change in the slope in the relaxation time-inverse temperature plot is less for x = 0.05 as compared to x = 0.0, which is consistent with the presence of a less fraction of the segregated pure NB-6BT phase and associated point defect concentration in the specimen. With the majority of the polar phase being different in the symmetry in this case, their temperature evolution is not so drastic within the specified temperature range.
While Cole-Cole plots of complex impedance show single semicircles above 100 Hz characteristic of bulk response (Fig. 4) for all the specimens, Cole-Cole plots in modulus formalism for higher Er-doped compositions show a double semicircle for the same frequency range, revealing the electrical heterogeneity in those compositions as shown in Fig. 10. In the case of x = 0.005, a single semicircle exists in the complex modulus plot also [Fig. 10(b)]. On the other hand, for x = 0.0, a slightly depressed semicircle is observed [Fig. 10(a)]. A clear double semicircle is observed for x = 0.05 [Fig. 10(c)]. Due to electrical homogeneity in the matrix, x = 0.005 shows a single semicircle, which indicates similar resistivity and capacitance in the grain and the grain boundary of the specimen. A slightly depressed semicircle for x = 0.0 is associated with the presence of the point defects and associated slight heterogeneity in the matrix. Clearly visible double semicircles in the case of x = 0.05 suggest the strong electrical heterogeneity in the matrix. The absence of double semicircles in the complex impedance plot and its persistence in the complex modulus plot are also reported by Sinclair and West for the semiconducting BaTiO_{3} based system [6]. Combining both the impedance and modulus formalism, the authors have proposed a core-shell model for rare earth doped BaTiO_{3} grains to explain its positive temperature coefficient of resistivity (PTCR) [6]. In their observation, semicircles in the complex modulus plots are assigned as grain and grain boundary responses, and the semicircles overlap around the frequency of 10 Hz of, which is consistent with the lower frequency response of the grain boundary. On the other hand, in our case, the overlap frequency region is very high (around 80 kHz), which suggests that those two semicircles are not associated with simply grain and grain boundary response. Moreover, in Figure 6, we have shown a possible grain boundary response below 100 Hz for x = 0.05. Sinclair et_al [6] have reported constant capacitance for the grain boundary in the rare earth doped BaTiO_{3} system, while we have observed temperature dependency in the capacitances [Fig. 10(c)] as both semicircles become bigger and bigger with the change in temperature. In this regard, their proposal of the core-shell approach for the outer part of the grain and grain interior is applicable in our case for the composition x = 0.05. Due to the less diffusivity of the rare earths, grain interiors might have segregated the pure NBT-6BT phase, while the outer region of grains has the erbium doped saturated phase with symmetrically different polar nanoregions as argued from Fig. 7(i). For a higher dopant concentration, the nanoscale chemical heterogeneity has led to the electrical heterogeneity in the system. The electrical heterogeneity gives mixed (electronic and ionic) electrical conductivity in this composition. Our results suggest that the rare earth doped NBT based systems can be utilized as mixed ionic/electronic conductors. Moreover, rare earths being efficient emitters of photoluminescence (PL) signals and NBT systems being new stable environmentally friendly host matrices for those emitters [19,32], our results suggest that rare earth doped NBT based systems can be utilized as multifunctional materials.
IV. CONCLUSION
In conclusion, we have carried out a systematic IS study of different NBT-6BT:xEr compositions. It is observed that a dilute concentration (x = 0.005) of erbium doping can significantly reduce the ionic conductivity/leakage current in the matrix, enhance the grain size, and improve the piezoelectric properties. For a higher erbium concentration (x ≥ 0.01), enhancement of the mixed (electronic and ionic) conductivity and local relaxation occurs due to the enhanced chemical heterogeneity in the matrix, which led to the nanoscale NBT-6BT phase segregation in the Er-saturated matrix. The frequency dependent imaginary part of the modulus spectra revealed the difference in the nature of symmetry in PNRs for larger erbium content compositions as compared to that of pure NBT-6BT. With the electrical conductivity of the specimens and photoluminescence property of rare earths, rare earth doped NBT-based systems can be utilized in future multifunctional devices.
