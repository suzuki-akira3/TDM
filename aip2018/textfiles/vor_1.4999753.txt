Penning ionization widths by Fano-algebraic diagrammatic construction method
We present an ab initio theory and computational method for Penning ionization widths. Our method is based on the Fano theory of resonances, algebraic diagrammatic construction (ADC) scheme for many-electron systems, and Stieltjes imaging procedure. It includes an extension of the Fano-ADC scheme [V. Averbukh and L. S. Cederbaum, J. Chem. Phys. 123, 204107 (2005)] to triplet excited states. Penning ionization widths of various He*–H_{2} states are calculated as a function of the distance R between He* and H_{2}. We analyze the asymptotic (large-R) dependences of the Penning widths in the region where the well-established electron transfer mechanism of the decay is suppressed by the multipole- and/or spin-forbidden energy transfer. The R^{−12} and R^{−8} power laws are derived for the asymptotes of the Penning widths of the singlet and triplet excited states of He*(1s2s^{1,3}S), respectively. We show that the electron transfer mechanism dominates Penning ionization of He*(1s2s^{3}S)–H_{2} up until the He*–H_{2} separation is large enough for the radiative decay of He* to become the dominant channel. The same mechanism also dominates the ionization of He*(1s2s^{1}S)–H_{2} when R < 5 Å. We estimate that the regime of energy transfer in the He*–H_{2} Penning ionization cannot be reached by approaching zero collisional temperature. However, the multipole-forbidden energy transfer mechanism can become important for Penning ionization in doped helium droplets.
I. INTRODUCTION
Penning ionization [1] is a collisional ionization process that can be represented as
where A and B are two atoms or molecules, and the asterisk sign on A denotes an electronically excited state, typically a metastable state of a noble gas atom. The ionization process takes place since the excitation energy of A* is higher than the ionization threshold of species B. In principle, the process can occur at arbitrarily low collisional energy. At such energy, the nuclear dynamics is assumed to happen well away from the avoided crossings and the conical intersections of the potential energy surfaces. Therefore the electronic structure of the whole system is well described within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation.
At fixed R, A* + B is essentially an autoionizing system, and its lifetime is the inverse of the autoionization width (τ = 1/Γ). An autoionization process can be described as a resultant from coupling of the artificially constructed bound state to the continuum. This general approach has been developed by Feshbach [2] and Fano [3]. The specific formula for Penning ionization widths has been derived using Feshbach projection operators in Ref [4]. Calculating Γ(R) is achieved by finding the wavefunctions for both the initial state A* + B and the final state A + B^{+} + e^{−} through selecting the appropriate electronic configurations for their representation [5–7]. Here we present a new ab initio method to calculate Penning ionization widths using a many-body Green’s function technique known as algebraic diagrammatic construction [8–11] (ADC). The Fano-ADC method was initially developed for the calculation of the decay rates of singly ionized states [12]. It was then generalized for the electronic decay of autoionizing excited states [13,14] and doubly ionized states [15]. So far the excited state autoionization Fano-ADC method has only been applied to singlet excitations. Penning ionization is usually realized using triplet excited states of atoms, which have long enough lifetimes to allow for the collisions to occur prior to radiative recombination. In the present work, we implement the triplet state Fano-ADC procedure and apply it to the calculation of Penning ionization widths.
The predominant physical mechanism of Penning ionization is dictated by the metastable nature of the long-lived excited species, A*, a prerequisite for a collision experiment. Since single-photon radiative recombination of A* is typically forbidden, either by dipole selection rules or by spin selection rules or by both so is also the energy transfer Penning process, consisting of recombination of A* and ionisation of B. As a result, Penning ionization proceeds by electron transfer from B to A*, accompanied by ionization of the excited electron. This mechanism is based on the electron cloud overlap between A and B, and the corresponding decay width decreases exponentially with A–B distance. At some large separation, though, the small but only polynomially decreasing energy transfer contribution should become dominant. For these large inter-atomic/inter-molecular separations to contribute appreciably to the total probability of the Penning event, the relative velocity of the two colliding species must be small enough, i.e., their approach time should be long enough. Recently, there has been significant experimental progress in ultracold Penning collisions [16], and it is now of interest to verify how low is the collisional energy at which the polynomial tail of the Penning decay width contributes significantly to the event probability. In what follows, we show that lowering the collision energies even beyond the presently achievable mK range will not lead to a significant energy transfer contribution.
II. THEORY
Following Fano [3] and Feshbach [2], the formula for Penning ionization width for a single final state (single channel) has been given by Miller [4],
where E_{0} is the energy of the initial state A* + B, calculated as the expectation value of the electronic Hamiltonian H^ with the initial (bound-like) state wavefunction, Ψ_{0}, and Ψ_{E0} is the wavefunction of the final (continuum) states, having the same energy E_{0} due to energy conservation. The wavefunctions satisfy the normalisation conditions
One notices that the orthogonality between Ψ_{0} and Ψ_{E0} is not required. It is due to the −E_{0} term in Eq. (2), which compensates for any overlap between the initial and the final state subspaces.
To construct the wavefunctions, Ψ_{0} and Ψ_{E}, we employ the ADC schemes within the intermediate state representation (ISR) [11]. In the ADC-ISR, the excited state wavefunction is expanded into configurations that are built by applying physical excitation operators (single excitation, double excitation, etc.) to the perturbation-theoretically corrected ground state, followed by a two-stage orthonormalisation procedure [11]. Unlike the standard CI expansions based on the Hartree-Fock reference state, the truncated ADC approximations are size consistent [17]. The first order ADC scheme, ADC(1), has the only contribution from singly excited (one-hole one-particle, 1h1p) configurations. For the calculations in this work, the ADC(2)x scheme was used. All the 1h1p and doubly excited (two-hole two-particle, 2h2p) configurations are included into the configuration space of ADC(2)x. In ADC(2)x, the perturbation expansion extends to second order in the 1h1p block and to first order in the 1h1p-2h2p and 2h2p-2h2p blocks. Both the initial and the final states of Penning ionization are of the 1h1p character since the initial state is singly excited while the final state is singly ionized. We shall see, nevertheless, that the larger configuration space of ADC(2)x is required for the correct description of the Penning ionisation.
Construction of the ADC approximations to Ψ_{0} and Ψ_{E} proceeds through selection of the appropriate configurations for each state. In the initial state of the system, A is excited, leaving a hole in A*. In the final state, B is ionized, leaving a hole in B^{+}. In a 1h1p configuration of A + B, the hole can be either located in A or B. When the hole is localised on A, the configuration is part of the initial state (A* + B) subspace. On the other hand, when the hole is localised on B, the configuration belongs to the final state (A + B^{+} + e^{−}) subspace. A 2h2p configuration with both holes in A belongs to the initial state subspace and its admixture reflects configuration interaction in the initial bound-like state. Similarly 2h2p configurations with both holes in B are added to the configuration subspace of the final state. All other 2h2p configurations with holes distributed over the two colliding particles can be included in both the initial state and the final state configuration subspaces. In Penning ionization, the inter-atomic/molecular distances are sufficiently large so that the hole localization is distinctly defined on one of the atoms/molecules.
In this work, the ADC-ISR configurations are obtained used Gaussian-type single-electron basis sets, as in most of the ab initio quantum chemical calculations. A consequence of using such functions is that contrary to the requirement of Eq. (4), the continuum is discretized and the wavefunctions of the states above the ionization threshold, {Φ_{i}}, are unit-normalized as
Another consequence is that the discretized continuum (E → E_{i}) violates the conservation of energy during the autoionization transition, unless by coincidence there is a state in the discretized continuum with the energy E_{i} = E_{0}. This complication is solved by the application of Stieltjes imaging [18] (SI). The SI procedure has been used extensively in solving bound-continuum coupling problems [12–15,19].
A straightforward formulation of the SI procedure requires computation of the full discrete pseudospectrum of the Hamiltonian matrix. This is often not practical and several solutions to this full diagonalisation bottleneck have been proposed in the literature (see, e.g., Gokhberg et_al [19] and references therein). In a series of studies on photoionisation cross sections and decay widths, we have shown that an efficient alternative to full diagonalisation is a substitution of the full discrete pseudospectrum by the result of iterative block-Lanczos diagonalization [20,21]. The Lanczos algorithm constructs a reduced-dimension effective Hamiltonian matrix H^{(M)} by representing the original Hamiltonian matrix, H, in the space of Gram-Schmidt-orthonormalised Krylov states, |φ_{k}⟩,
where the zero-th Krylov state, φ_{0}, is chosen as the best guess to the state of interest of the diagonalisation procedure. In the case of block-Lanczos method, such as used here, a set of φ0m starting states is selected. For Penning ionization, the states of interest are the final singly ionised states of the electronic decay, and we therefore choose our initial block as a collection of all the final subspace 1h1p configurations.
To gain more physical insight on Penning ionization and estimate Γ(R) qualitatively before doing the calculation, Eq. (2) is going to be expanded and analysed within the framework of the Wigner-Weisskopf theory [22]. If the wavefunctions of the initial and the final states of Penning ionization are single Slater determinants constructed using the same orthonormal set of molecular orbitals, Eq. (2) becomes
where ϕ_{A} and ϕ_{B} are occupied orbitals of A and B, ϕ_{A^{*}} is the excited orbital of A*, χ_{E0} is the continuum orbital of the free electron, and r_{12} is the distance between the two electrons. The first term of Eq. (7) corresponds to an energy transfer mechanism of Penning ionization. A* de-excites to A, and the excess energy goes to B ionizing it. The second term of Eq. (7) corresponds to the usually dominant electron transfer mechanism. One B electron fills the hole in A*, while the initially excited electron is ejected into continuum producing A + e^{−}. Efficiency of the electron transfer mechanism depends strongly on the distance R that affects the overlap between orbitals ϕ_{A} and ϕ_{B}. As long as A and B are not too close together, the overlap between ϕ_{A} and ϕ_{B} is determined by the asymptotic parts of the orbitals which are exponential functions of the distance from their respective atoms (or molecules). As a result, the electron transfer term as a function of R is exponential as well. At shorter R, the overlap between ϕ_{A} and ϕ_{B} is no longer exponential, and the form of Γ(R) becomes system-specific.
The energy transfer term, on the other hand, does not rely on the overlap between A and B. At R ≫ r_{1}, r_{2}, one can write
where the z-axis coincides with the inter-atomic axis, R. The energy transfer term is then expanded into a series of multipole couplings [23],
where d_{1} and d_{2} represent the transition dipole moments ⟨ϕ_{A}|r^{1}|ϕ_{A^{*}}⟩ and ⟨χ_{E0}|r^{2}|ϕ_{B}⟩, r^{1} and r^{2} are position operators relative to centres of A and B, respectively. Equation (9) is derived from the R^{−3} term of Eq. (8). Equation (9) shows that if A* → A is a dipole-allowed transition, then the energy transfer term is proportional to R^{−3}. However, recombination transitions of the metastable states used in Penning ionisation experiments are typically forbidden, sometimes by more than a single selection rule of multipole and/or spin nature.
For example, single-photon dipole transition is forbidden in the decay of He*(1s2s^{1}S) → He(1s^{21}S). By taking the electron repulsion potential V^=Σ_{i>j}(1/r_{ij}) as the perturbation, the corresponding second-order perturbation expression of the Penning ionization width in the Wigner-Weisskopf theory [24] is
where Ψ_{i} and E_{i} are the wavefunctions and energies of dipole-allowed virtual states, respectively. At large R, both ⟨Ψ_{E}|V^|Ψ_{i}⟩ and ⟨Ψ_{i}|V^|Ψ_{0}⟩ expand according to Eq. (9), resulting in
Unlike in the theory of inter-atomic Coulombic decay (ICD) widths in clusters [25], here one is unable to find a general expression that relates the asymptotic (large-R) Penning ionization width given by Eq. (10) to the radiative decay rate of He and photoionization cross section of the ionised species B because each virtual transition of He is coupled to a corresponding virtual transition of B in the sum of Eq. (10). As a result, the Penning ionisation width does not factorise into the radiative decay and photoionisation terms.
An asymptotic power law similar to Eq. (11) can be derived for another typical Penning ionization system, He*(1s2s^{3}S)–B. The metastable atom He*(1s2s^{3}S) is initially a triplet state. As a result of Penning ionization, the atom de-excites and becomes singlet. The transition is forbidden in non-relativistic quantum mechanics. The relativistic corrections to the two-electron term 1/r_{12} can be derived from the Dirac equation. Expanding the Dirac equation to the 1/c^{2} order produces the Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian [26] which contains two-electron terms of spin-orbit and spin-spin nature. For a two-electron system, the spin-dependent corrections to 1/r_{12} in the Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian are
where p^{1} and p^{2} are momentum operators of electron 1 and 2, respectively, σ^{1} and σ^{2} are Pauli spin vectors, and r^{12}=r^{1}−r^{2}+R is the distance between the two electrons (r_{12}=|r^{12}|). In the asymptotic region, one can ignore the contribution from the last term in Eq. (12). Replacing 1/r_{12} with H^{spin} in Eq. (7), we obtain a non-zero energy transfer term for systems of the He*(1s2s^{3}S)–B type,
where only those terms of the H^{spin} interaction are retained in the H^{E−transfer} operator that let electron 1 change its spin state,
i.e., the choice of the direct matrix element only (leaving out the exchange integral corresponding to the electron transfer) breaks the permutational symmetry. Equation (14) can be expanded in powers of R^{−1} the same way as Eq. (9). The expansion of Eq. (14) requires
and
Both equations, (15) and (16), are obtained from Eq. (8).
The leading term of Eq. (14) is R^{−2},
which vanishes due to the orthogonality between the initial and final wavefunctions, as each term in Eq. (17) has only one spatial operator. The next order in the expansion is
The spin-spin terms in Eq. (18) vanish immediately because they do not have any spatial operator. Other terms do not contribute either because ⟨2s|r^|1s⟩=⟨2s|p^|1s⟩=⟨2s|r^×p^|1s⟩=0. The next order in the expansion is
The R^{−4} order does not vanish, and it reduces to
where only those spatial terms that couple 1s and 2s orbitals have been retained. Substitution into the Wigner-Weisskopf expression and neglecting the exchange (electron transfer) contribution, we obtain the long-distance approximation for the decay width of the He*(1s2s^{3}S)–B system,
where ξ_{A} and ξ_{A^{*}} are spinors of ϕ_{A} and ϕ_{A^{*}}. Here, unlike in the singlet He case, the asymptotic expression does factorise into the recombination and ionisation terms. However, neither the recombination nor the ionisation matrix elements are proportional to those of the lowest-order processes in the isolated atoms, such that use of the corresponding radiative lifetimes and photoionisation cross-sections to simplify the expression (21) cannot be made.
III. RESULTS
We applied the Fano-ADC-Stieltjes-Lanczos method to calculate Penning ionization widths in the He*–H_{2} systems for a series of metastable states of He. The first step of the Fano-ADC calculation is obtaining the restricted Hartree-Fock solution for the ground state He–H_{2}. This has been achieved using an ab initio program package MOLCAS 7.6 [27]. We used the fully uncontracted cc-pV5Z Gaussian-type basis set [28] augmented with 8s4p3d2f1g Kaufmann-Baumeister-Jungen diffuse Gaussian functions [29] for both He and H_{2}. Then the ADC(2)x Hamiltonian matrix for the initial state He*–H_{2} was constructed using the configuration selection algorithm described in Sec. II and diagonalized using the Davidson algorithm [30]. The initial state wavefunction has been selected from the Davidson eigenstates as possessing the largest overlap with the 1h1p configuration that represents the initial state and the eigenvalue closest to the isolated atom excitation energy. Next, the matrix for the final state was constructed and diagonalized using block-Lanczos algorithm. Each discretized continuum wavefunction produced was then coupled to the initial state wavefunction according to Eq. (2). Finally, Γ(E) is recovered by the SI technique and interpolated to produce the Γ(E_{0}), i.e., the Penning ionization width of a specific initial state He*–H_{2}. The procedure was repeated for different R values, orientations of H_{2}, and excited states of He. The distance between He and the centre of mass of H_{2} is parametrized by R. The orientation of H_{2} is parametrized by θ such that at θ = 0°, all the nuclei are aligned, whereas at θ = 90°, the bond of H_{2} is perpendicular to the direction of R. The bond length of H_{2} was fixed to be 0.7428 Å. In what follows, we consider the θ = 0° case unless mentioned otherwise.
First we compare our results with Penning ionization widths calculated by other groups, shown in Fig. 1. We calculate the Penning ionisation width of He*(1s2s^{3}S)–H_{2} using the Fano-ADC method and also using an analytical approximation of Γ(R) evaluated as the overlaps between the tails of hydrogenic wavefunctions [31] such that Γ(R) is simply parameterized by the ionization potentials of He and H_{2}. And we compare the results with stabilization method calculations of the same system [32,33]. Our result is in good agreement with the analytical model and the two other calculations. We then calculate the Penning ionisation width with the same atom and molecule at θ = 90°. The resulting ionisation widths for θ = 0° and θ = 90° have the same exponent and are very similar in magnitude. We compare the T-shape (θ = 90°) result with a calculation using the resonances via Padé (RVP) technique [34]. The RVP width is only in agreement with other results before 3 Å; it decays with distance at a different exponent.
Considering the singlet case, we note that Eq. (10) contains a summation over all the virtual states that couple to the initial and the final states through dipole transitions. If the initial and final states in Eq. (10) are represented by 1h1p single Slater determinants, the virtual states Ψ_{i} will be 2h2p configurations that can be reached by dipole transitions from both the initial and the final states. Therefore the 2h2p configurations are necessary to describe correctly the asymptotic tail of Γ(R) in the singlet case. Figure 2 compares the results of Γ(R) with and without including the virtual 2h2p states Ψ_{i} in Eq. (10), demonstrating the importance of these configurations for the description of the Penning process. In particular, we see that the exponential (electron transfer) behaviour of the decay width disappears after 5 Å and instead the predicted polynomial (energy transfer) dependence sets in.
Fano-ADC(2)x calculation for the He*(1s2s^{3}S)–H_{2} system is shown in Fig. 3. In the triplet case, Γ(R) is an exponential function of R between 3 Å and 8 Å due to electron transfer. Since there is no spin-orbit coupling term in our Fano-ADC(2)x approximation, the power law of Eq. (21) is not reproduced. We can, nevertheless, evaluate the asymptotic decay width of Eq. (21) directly by computing the appropriate recombination (r^{2}) and ionisation (p) matrix elements between the appropriate Hartree-Fock orbitals of He*(1s2s^{3}S) and H_{2}. We have performed such a calculation using Stieltjes imaging for the ionisation matrix element. The spin part of Eq. (21) has been averaged over all the spin direction, giving
where, given R is aligned with the z-axis, ⟨p_{x}⟩ = ⟨p_{y}⟩. Figure 4 shows that the energy transfer term is overwhelmed by the electron transfer term in Penning ionization of He*(^{3}S)–H_{2} with a small intermolecular distance. With an intermolecular distance of 12.5 Å or larger, the ionization process will be killed by the radiative decay of the excited He*(^{3}S) atom.
Figure 5 shows the Penning ionization width of the He*(1s2s^{3}S)–H_{2} system calculated at different θ from 0° to 90°. It shows that θ only changes the relative magnitude of the ionization width and does not affect the exponent of Γ(R). Figure 6 shows the dependence of the ionization width on θ. The initial state is He*(1s2s^{3}S)–H_{2} with θ varying from 0° to 90°. We find that the rotation of H_{2} has a very small effect on Γ(R). Figure 7 compares Γ(R)’s of different initial states. Three excited states of He are compared, He*(1s2s^{3}S), He*(1s2p_{x}^{3}P), and He*(1s2p_{z}^{3}P), where z is in the direction of R. Again, different initial states do not have significantly different Γ(R)’s.
Figure 8 shows the Γ(R) of He*(1s2s^{1}S)–H_{2} in the asymptotic region. It is clear from Fig. 8 that the calculated Γ(R) matches the prediction of Eq. (11) very well. Knowing the form of Γ(R), one is able to make a simple classical calculation that determines the physical significance of this asymptotic tail in a Penning collision. For fixed R, the survival probability of the initial state is P(t) = exp (−Γt). If He* and H_{2} are colliding, Γ(R) changes with time, and the survival probability becomes
where v(R) is the relative velocity between He*(1s2s^{1}S) and H_{2}. The value of v(R) is determined by the temperature of the system (v∼k_{B}T/m) and by the potential energy gradient they experience as they move towards each other. For the R^{−12} tail to have significant contribution to the ionization probability, the integral in Eq. (23) has to be of the order of unity
where the lower limit of the integral is the minimal distance at which Eq. (11) still holds, which is about 5 Å. We estimate that the dispersion force due to 2s-excited helium polarisability [36] will draw an arbitrarily cold He and H_{2} from 20 Å to 5 Å in about a picosecond resulting in the energy transfer Penning yield of about 0.05%.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
In this work, we have extended the Fano-ADC-Stieltjes-Lanczos method to triplet excitations and applied it to the calculation of Penning ionization widths. Fano-ADC was used to construct the initial and the final state wavefunctions of Penning ionization. The Stieltjes-Lanczos procedure dealt with the problem of discretized continuum. Above 3 Å, all the calculated Γ(R)’s display exponential features to a certain extent. It is explained by the electron transfer mechanism and the exponentially decreasing overlap of the involved orbitals. In the triplet case of He*–H_{2}, our computational results show strong domination of the electron transfer mechanism over energy transfer mechanism at small R (<10 Å). Our analytical results show that the domination continues until 15 Å where the radiative decay of He* becomes the dominant decay channel. In the case of singlet system He*(1s2s^{1}S)–H_{2}, the result of Γ(R) shows R^{−12} dependence after 5 Å due to the second-order energy transfer mechanism. The energy transfer mechanism dominates in the singlet case for another 15 Å until Penning ionization is suppressed by the radiative decay. Equation (11) confirms that the correct R-dependence is obtained. The value of Γ(R) in this asymptotic region is very small (<1 μeV). Our classical estimations show that lowering the collisional temperature will not result in substantial contribution of the energy transfer mechanism because in the low kinetic energy regime, the time scale of the collision defined by the attractive tail of the potential is much faster than the energy transfer Penning decay. Nevertheless, the asymptotic part of the ionization width in the singlet case still has a physical significance because it starts from above the decay width of the metastable He* (Fig. 8); as a result the Penning ionization is still a faster process than the radiative recombination. Therefore, we propose a different physical realization of the asymptotic Penning decay using doped helium droplets. Metastable helium atoms produced by electron impact tend to stay on the surface of a helium droplet [37], while impurities captured by the droplet move rapidly to the center [38] (with few exceptions [39]). Since the typical sizes of helium droplets are much larger than 5 Å [40], at which the asymptotic tail begins, small doped helium droplets are potential candidates for observing the R^{−12} decay of Penning ionization, unless the decay rate of He* changes significantly on droplets. This process would then be equivalent to resonant inter-atomic Coulombic decay (RICD) [41]; see the study of normal ICD in He droplets in Ref [42]. The situation for the triplet case is principally different: in the region where the energy transfer term dominates the Penning decay width, it is several orders of magnitude lower than the radiative decay making the energy transfer in the triplet system unobservable.
