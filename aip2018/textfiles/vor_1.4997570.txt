The role of geodesic acoustic mode on reducing the turbulent transport in the edge plasma of tokamak
Three sets of triple probe arrays (four-tip) are applied to study the transport properties at the edge of a HL-2A tokamak. The Geodesic Acoustic Mode (GAM) exhibits intermittent characteristics during the discharge. The radial particle flux has been studied in different phases corresponding to the variable GAM intensity. The experimental results reveal that the radial particle flux contributed by the ambient turbulence (20kHz–100kHz) has been suppressed by 13% during the GAM bursts, contrasting weak GAM cases. Power of density fluctuations and coherence between density and potential fluctuations contribute to most reduction of the particle flux, while changing the cross phase between the density and potential fluctuations and the suppression of power of potential fluctuations hardly contribute to it. These results suggest that the GAM can regulate the turbulent transport mainly by changing the amplitude of ambient turbulence, rather than the cross phase between density and potential fluctuations.
Zonal flows (ZFs) have been studied intensively over the past two decades on various magnetic toroidal devices in the world. Experimental results reveal that zonal flows (ZFs), including the geodesic acoustic mode (GAM) and the low (quasi zero) frequency zonal flow (LFZF), are electrostatic fluctuations. The mode number of zonal flows has been identified in various toroidal devices, such as DIII-D [1], JFT-2M [2] and HL-2A [3,4]; the studies on these devices show that zonal flows are symmetric at poloidal and toroidal directions, and with a finite radial mode number of centimeter magnitude. The intermittent characteristics of zonal flows has also been reported in CHS [5], T10 [6], ASDEX-U [7], JIPP T-llU [8], and JFT-2M during stationary discharging.
Theoretical and experimental results reveal that ambient turbulence (AT) can be suppressed by E_{r}×B shear flow [9,10], including the mean shear flow E¯{r}×B [11] and the time-dependent shear flow Ẽ{r}×B [12,13]. The latter one corresponds to zonal flows. T. S. Hahm's theoretical work predicts that zonal flows provide effective suppression on ambient turbulence (AT) when f_{ZFs} < f_{AT}, with f_{AT} being the frequency of ambient turbulence (AT). Modulation of AT by GAM has been observed using an envelope analysis method on various devices [2,14–16].
In contrast to LFZF, GAM has a finite frequency depending on the local temperature. This characteristic determines that GAM can be detected more easily. In our experiment, we use three arrays of a four-tip Langmuir probe to investigate the GAM and its relationship with radial particle transport. The stationary discharge can be divided into two states from the intermittent characteristics of GAM, the strong GAM state (during the strong bursts of GAM) and the weak GAM state (without or weak bursts of GAM). Experimental results reveal that the radial particle flux is suppressed by 13% in the strong GAM state compared to the weak GAM state. The role of each term in the equation of radial particle flux has been studied.
The frequency resolved radial particle flux formula is listed as follows: 
The mechanism of mean shear flow suppressing the turbulence has been studied for many years; yet, its role has not been confirmed. Generally speaking, the opinions of the mechanism can be classified into three kinds. The first opinion emphasizes the suppression of amplitude of density and potential fluctuations, as |P_{ne}||P_{Eθ}| in Eq. (1) [17]. The second one focuses on the relationship between density and potential fluctuations, as γ_{neEθ} and cos[α_{neEθ]}(f) terms [18,19]. The last one considers that both of them contribute to the reduction of radial particle flux [20,21]. Yet, the role of zonal flows in suppression turbulence is rarely discussed, especially for experiment. By comparing the change in each of the physical parameters in Eq. (1) of the weak and strong GAM states mentioned above, our results show that both the amplitude of density |P_{ne}| and the coherence between density and potential fluctuations γ_{neEθ} and cos[α_{neEθ}](f) hardly contribute to it. The results are consistent with Falchetto's simulation results [22].
The experiments were performed on the HL-2A tokamak with the major radius and minor radius being R=1.6m and a=0.38cm, respectively. The plasma is Ohmic heated with the working gas of deuterium for our experiments and in a limiter configuration. The typical plasma discharging parameters are listed as follows: the plasma current I_{p}=200−230kA, the toroidal magnetic field B_{ϕ}=1.5T and the line-averaged density n¯{e}=2×10^{19}m^{−3}. The edge safety factor is q_{95}=3.2–3.7 at the radial position ρ≡r/a=0.95. In the HL-2A tokamak, there are two fast reciprocating probe systems (marked A and B) located on the weak field side of the middle plane with a toroidal separation of 130 cm, as shown in Fig. 1. In system A, three sets of a four-tip Langmuir probe array marked as A1 A2 A3 are arranged poloidally with d_{θ}=12cm for A1 and A3, and all three probes are fixed at the same radial position. These four tips are composed as the typical triple-probe to obtain the local plasma parameters, such as the plasma density, the floating potential and the plasma electron temperature. All the signals are sampled by 12 bit digitizers at a sampling rate of 1 MHz. The effect of neglecting electron temperature fluctuations on probe fluctuation measurements, in particular, the turbulent particle flux and the relative fluctuation level of plasma potential, had been studied before [18,23]. The results show that neglecting does not fundamentally change the estimation results. Therefore, the floating potential ϕ_{f} is applied to study the potential characteristics of turbulence. The radial velocity ṽ{r} is derived from the poloidal electric field ṽ{r}=Ẽ{θ}×B_{ϕ}. Thus, the radial particle flux Γ_{r}≡⟨n_{e}v_{r}⟩=⟨n_{e}E_{θ}/B⟩ can also be measured by the four-tip probe.
Figures 2(a) and 2(b) show the spectra of coherence and cross-phase estimated by floating potentials ϕ̃{f} s in probe A1 and probe A3 at the same radial position with ρ∼0.95. A coherent mode peaking at 11 kHz with a strong coherence of ∼0.95 can be observed in the spectrum. Benefiting from the long poloidal distance between the probes, short wavenumber components of the turbulence are filtered in the spectra. Such coherence of ambient turbulence (AT) in a high frequency region (f>20kHz) is close to the noise level. In addition, the cross phase of the coherent mode frequency is almost zero, distinguishing from the high frequency parts of AT, as shown in Fig. 2(b). From the cross-phase spectrum, the poloidal mode number of the coherent mode can be calculated as |m|≤0.04. Its mode frequency (f_{CM}=11kHz) is consistent with the theoretically predicted eigen frequency of geodesic acoustic mode (GAM), where fGAMTh≈2C_{s}/2πR=9.5kHz. Here, C_{s}=(T_{i}+T_{e})/m_{i} is the ion sound speed and m_{i} is the mass of the ion. The ion temperature is assumed to be equal to the electron temperature as T_{i}≈T_{e}=47.7eV. The toroidal mode number of the coherent mode is also estimated as |n|≤0.3. Thus, the coherent mode is concluded to be GAM from the symmetrical mode structure of the coherent mode, and its mode frequency matches the temperature scaling of GAM frequency.
The intermittent characteristics of GAM have been observed in different plasma devices. Figure 3 illustrates the intermittent spectrum of GAM observed on HL-2A. Here, to obtain a quantitative description of intermittency, two data processing techniques have been applied. One method is a wavelet based technique that calculates the time-resolved complex wavelet cross-spectrum of two fluctuations. The contour map of the time-resolved wavelet cross-spectrum of ϕ̃{f,A1} and ϕ̃{f,A3} is illustrated in Fig. 3(a). One may see a set of non-periodic bursts of GAM in the frequency range 7kHz–16kHz shown as the bright contours.
The role signals contain not only zonal flows, but also ambient turbulence. To get rid of the effect of ambient turbulence and to provide the temporal evolution of pure power of GAM, we calculate the correlation function of ϕ̃{A1} and ϕ̃{A3} as C(t,τ)=⟨ϕ̃{A1}(t)∗ϕ̃{A3}(τ−t)⟩ by moving the temporal window along the time axis of the potential signals. Here, the length of the time window is 100 points, corresponding to τ_{max}=100μs in our experiment. Each example is firstly detrended before further processing. Because of the poloidal symmetry of GAM, the time lag of GAM should be τ = 0. So, the power of GAM can be described as C(t,τ=0) for m=n=0, as shown in Fig. 3(b). The correlation function C(0) is essentially the time-resolved power of GAM. The standard deviation δ of C(0) is illustrated as the gray dashed line.
As mentioned above, the correlation function C(t,τ=0) can be used as a criterion which quantifies the intensity of GAM. Thus, we can divide the time fractions into two parts with C(t,τ0)>2δ corresponding to the strong GAM bursting stage and C(t,τ=0)<δ/2 corresponding to the weak or no GAM bursting stage. The cross power spectrum of ϕ̃{f,A1} and ϕ̃{f,A3} of these two situations has been estimated, as shown in Fig. 4(a). The great difference in GAM's power can be observed in the frequency range of 7kHz–16kHz, demonstrating the reasonableness of the dividing method mentioned above. Meanwhile, k_{θ} spectra of turbulence (>20kHz) from two poloidal points separated by 7 mm change little; it shows that the mean flow (v_{θ}=ω/k_{θ},v_{θ}=E¯{r}×B/B^{2}) remains almost the same in the strong GAM and weak GAM situations; thus, we can neglect the effect of mean shear flow. The spectra of radial electric field fluctuation |Ẽ{r}|^{2}(f) are shown in Fig. 4(b). The radial electric field E_{r} is calculated from the time delay of two ϕ̃{f} s separated poloidally by 7 mm of a four-tip probe as A2. Here, a technique called Dynamic Programming (DP) is applied to estimate the time delay [24]. The dynamic programming can provide a frequency response five to ten times better than the previously known time delay estimation (TDE) technique, which is usually used to extract poloidal rotation velocity fluctuations (ṽ{θ}∝Ẽ{r}) from the density or potential turbulence data [14,25]. Figure 4(d) shows the radial wave number spectrum of Ẽ{r} between Ẽ{r,A2} and Ẽ{r,B2}. In contrast to the strong GAM stage and the weak GAM stage, the radial wave number of GAM k_{r,GAM}(f) rarely changes, while |Ẽ{r,GAM}|^{2} is larger when C(t,τ=0)>2δ (black solid line).
Figure 5(a) illustrates the frequency-resolved radial particle flux Γ_{r}, which is measured by a four-tip probe A2 of probe system A. The normalized radial position of this probe array is around 0.95. The black circle marked line is the spectral power of the radial particle flux Γ_{r} at a strong GAM burst duration, whereas the red square marked line refers to the spectra of Γ_{r} at the weak duration. Both spectra peaks at ∼50kHz with 20kHz<f_{AT}<100kHz, indicating that ambient turbulence in the frequency range dominates most of the abnormal particle flux. The particle transport is suppressed by 13% from the shearing effect of strong GAM in contrast to the weak GAM. The result of Fig. 5(a) provides direct evidence that GAM can suppress the particle transport contributed by the ambient turbulence. It needs to be mentioned that Γ_{r} monotonously decreases with the power of GAM C(t,τ=0), as shown in Fig. 5(b).
With the E × B advection present, the turbulence decorrelation rate measured in the lab frame is ΔωDlab=Δω(v_{E×B}/l_{θ})[ΔωD−2+lθ2/vE×B2]{1/2} [26,27]. In the case considered here, l_{θ} is the poloidal correlation length and Δω_{D}∼1/τ_{AC}∼6.0×10^{4}s^{−1} in the L-mode in the absence of significant advection (v_{E×B}≈0). The effective E_{r}×B shearing rate can be calculated from Ẽ{r} and k_{r}, where ω_{eff,strong}=7.0×10^{4}s^{−1} at the strong GAM stage and ω_{eff,weak}=2.2×10^{4}s^{−1} at the weak stage. The value of ω_{eff,strong} is comparable to ΔωDlab, indicating that the GAM plays an important role in modulating the ambient turbulence in L-mode. Yet, the intermittency of the GAM shows that the modulation to ambient turbulence cannot last long.
The radial particle flux is composed of four terms such as the density fluctuations ñ{e}, poloidal electric field fluctuations Ẽ{θ}, coherence γ_{neEθ} and cross phase cosθ_{neEθ} between ñ{e} and Ẽ{θ}, as shown in Eq. (1). To investigate which term plays the main role in the suppression of particle flux, the change in each term in strong GAM and weak GAM situations has been estimated, as shown in Fig. 6. The power of density fluctuation is suppressed by 5%, and the coherence between ñ{e} and Ẽ{θ} decreases by 5% in the range from 30 kHz to 80 kHz at the strong GAM burst stage. The changes can be seen significantly as shown in Figs. 6(a) and 6(c), respectively. Those two parts contribute to most of the decrease of Γ_{r}. At the same time, reduction of the electric field fluctuation level is small, and the cross phase drifts little between the strong GAM and weak GAM situations. The results reveal that the role of GAM in reducing the particle flux is the suppression of density fluctuations of ambient turbulence and the decorrelation of coupling between density fluctuation and electric field (or potential) fluctuation, with both terms being of same importance. Whereas the other two terms change slightly, especially for the cross phase between ñ{e} and Ẽ{θ}, just contributing 0.3% of 13% decrease of Γ_{r}, which can also be seen in Table I. Table I also lists the weighting formula of each term. Here, the error of the power spectrum depends on the sampled digitizers, which are12-bit digitizers in our experiments. The error of coherence between Ẽ{θ} and ñ{e} depends on the statistical ensembles M with Δγ_{Ẽθ&ñe}∼1/M. Here, M∼300 in our estimation.
In conclusion, the characteristics of GAM and radial particle transport have been studied by the four-tip Langmuir probe arrays on the low field side of a HL-2A tokamak. Using the probes separated by 12 cm in the poloidal direction, we can measure the poloidal mode number of GAM with m≈0. The GAM shows a significant characteristic of intermittency. Thus, the discharge can be divided into strong GAM discharge and weak (or no GAM) discharge. Statistical analysis of the radial abnormal particle flux shows that the flux contributed by ambient turbulence is suppressed by 13% when the GAM is strong. A monotonously decreasing relationship between particle flux and power of GAM has been found, providing a direct proof that GAM can suppress the radial particle flux. Besides, we compare the change in the four terms of the radial particle flux equation in the strong GAM and weak GAM discharges. The results reveal that the power of density fluctuations and coherence between density and potential fluctuations contribute to the main reduction of the flux, while the cross phase between density and potential fluctuations, as well as the power of potential hardly contribute to it.
