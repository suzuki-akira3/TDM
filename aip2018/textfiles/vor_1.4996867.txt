A synchronous game for binary constraint systems
Recently, Slofstra proved that the set of quantum correlations is not closed. We prove that the set of synchronous quantum correlations is not closed, which implies his result, by giving an example of a synchronous game that has a perfect quantum approximate strategy but no perfect quantum strategy. We also exhibit a graph for which the quantum independence number and the quantum approximate independence number are different. We prove new characterisations of synchronous quantum approximate correlations and synchronous quantum spatial correlations. We solve the synchronous approximation problem of Dykema and the second author, which yields a new equivalence of Connes’ embedding problem in terms of synchronous correlations.
I. INTRODUCTION
Suppose that two separated labs, Alice’s and Bob’s, are in a possible entangled state and can each perform one of n quantum experiments and each experiment has k outcomes. Let p(a, b|x, y) denote the probability that Alice and Bob get outcomes a and b, respectively, when Alice performs experiment x and Bob performs experiment y. The n^{2}k^{2}-tuple, obtained as x and y vary over all experiments and a and b vary over all outcomes is known as a quantum correlation. Tsirelson [1,2] proposed several mathematical models for the set of all such n^{2}k^{2}-tuples that could be considered to be quantum correlations. Determining whether or not various pairs of these models yield the same sets of tuples have come to be known as the Tsirelson conjectures. We will describe these models in Sec. II, but for now we remark that there are 4 potentially different models, yielding sets of n^{2}k^{2}-tuples which we denote by C_{q}(n, k), C_{qs}(n, k), C_{qa}(n, k), and C_{qc}(n, k).
One of the primary ways to approach these conjectures has been through the theory of finite input-output games, also known as non-local games. These games are defined by a verifier function V (x, y, a, b) that determines whether each input-output tuple wins or loses. A conditional probability density p(a, b|x, y) such that p(a, b|x, y) = 0, whenever V (x, y, a, b) loses, is called a perfect strategy. We call p(a, b|x, y) a perfect t-strategy if it is a perfect strategy and p(a, b|x, y) ∈ C_{t}(n, k), where t can be either q, qs, qa, or qc. We discuss such games more carefully in Sec. II.
Slofstra [3] solved one of the Tsirelson conjecture’s by exhibiting a binary constraint system (BCS) game with n ∼ 100 inputs and k = 8 outputs, which has a perfect qa-strategy but no perfect q-strategy, thus showing that C_{q}(n, 8) ≠ C_{qa}(n, 8) for sufficiently large n. His result also shows that for sufficiently large n the set C_{q}(n, 8) is not closed. Recently, Dykema, Paulsen, and Prakash [4] have shown that C_{q}(n, k) is not closed for all n ≥ 5, k ≥ 2.
Other authors, including Paulsen and Todorov [5], Paulsen et_al [6], and Ortiz and Paulsen [7], proposed studying Tsirelson’s conjectures by studying perfect strategies for games based on various graph theoretical parameters. These games all had the property that whenever Alice and Bob received the same input, then to win they had to produce the same output. This led Paulsen et_al [6] to describe such games as synchronous.
A perfect strategy p(a, b|x, y) for a synchronous game necessarily satisfies p(a, b|x, x) = 0 whenever a ≠ b and such densities are called synchronous correlations. In the work of Dykema and Paulsen [8], a detailed analysis of synchronous correlations was carried out and it was proven that a positive answer to Connes’ embedding conjecture is equivalent to the statement that the closure of the synchronous q-correlations is equal to the synchronous qc-correlations for every n, k.
In this paper, building on Slofstra’s work, we prove that the set of synchronous quantum correlations is not closed. We do this by constructing a synchronous game that has a perfect qa-strategy but no perfect q-strategy. We also construct a graph G with the property that α_{q}(G) < α_{qa}(G), where these numbers are the quantum independence number and approximate quantum independence number of G, respectively. These results rely on a major part of Slofstra’s construction, but then use the ideas on quantum graph isomorphisms from the work of Atserias et_al [9] To carry out this program, we need to extend the material in the work of Atserias et_al [9] on quantum graph isomorphisms to the cases of qa-strategies and qc-strategies. The extension of the ideas of Atserias et_al [9] to qc-strategies is minor, but the extension to qa-strategies builds on new characterisations of synchronous qa-strategies which are the main technical results of this paper.
Section II contains many preliminary results and definitions, some background material on quantum correlations and synchronous games, and some remarks on the material in the work of Atserias et_al [9] to include other types of quantum isomorphisms.
Section III includes some new results on the connections between synchronous correlations and traces. In particular, we prove that the sets of synchronous q-correlations and synchronous qs-correlations are equal. Paulsen et_al [6] proved that synchronous correlations arise from traces on C*-algebras and were able to characterise the types of traces corresponding to synchronous q-correlations and qc-correlations. We complete this correspondence by proving that synchronous qa-correlations arise from amenable traces. We also answer the synchronous approximation problem from the work of Dykema and Paulsen [8], which shows that Connes’ embedding problem is equivalent to proving the equality of the set of synchronous qa-correlations with the set of synchronous qc-correlations. This in turn leads to another proof of Ozawa’s [10] equivalence of Connes’ embedding problem with the equality of the set of all qa-correlations with the set of all qc-correlations.
In Sec. IV, we prove that the sets of synchronous q-correlations and synchronous qa-correlations are not equal. This implies Slofstra’s [3] result that the set of quantum correlations is not closed, when the number of inputs and outputs is sufficiently large.
Finally, in Sec. V, we return to the study of quantum versions of graph parameters and exhibit a graph for which α_{q}(G) < α_{qa}(G).
II. PRELIMINARIES ON CORRELATIONS AND QUANTUM GRAPH THEORY
Suppose that Alice has n_{A} quantum experiments each with m_{A} outcomes and Bob has n_{B} quantum experiments each with m_{B} outcomes and that their combined labs are in some combined, possibly entangled, state. We let p(a, b|x, y) denote the conditional probability that if Alice conducts experiment x and Bob conducts experiment y, then they get outcomes a and b, respectively. The n_{A}n_{B}m_{A}m_{B}-tuple
of real numbers is, informally, called a quantum correlation. There are several different mathematical models that can be used to describe these values, denoted by the subscripts q, qs, qa, and qc. The Tsirelson problems are concerned with whether or not these different mathematical models yield the same sets. Due to the work of Slofstra [3], we now know that in some cases these sets are different.
We now recall the formal definitions of these sets. First, the different mathematical models shall be denoted by a subscript t where t can be either q, qs, qa, or qc. We let C_{t}(n_{A},n_{B},m_{A},m_{B})⊆R^{nAnBmAmB} denote the set of all possible tuples p(a,b|x,y) that can be obtained using the model t. We now describe each of these models.
When t = q, we have that p(a, b|x, y) ∈ C_{q}(n_{A}, n_{B}, m_{A}, m_{B}) if and only if there exist finite dimensional Hilbert spaces H_{A} and H_{B}, orthogonal projections E_{x,a}∈B(H_{A}), 1 ≤ x ≤ n_{A}, 1 ≤ a ≤ m_{A} satisfying ∑a=1m_{A}E_{x,a}=I_{HA}, for all x, orthogonal projections F_{y,b}∈B(H_{B}), 1 ≤ y ≤ n_{B}, 1 ≤ b ≤ m_{B} satisfying ∑b=1m_{B}F_{y,b}=I_{HB}, for all y and a unit vector ψ∈H_{A}⊗H_{B} such that
The set C_{qs}(n_{A}, n_{B}, m_{A}, m_{B}) is defined similarly, except that the Hilbert spaces H_{A} and H_{B} are no longer required to be finite dimensional.
It is known that the closure of C_{q}(n_{A}, n_{B}, m_{A}, m_{B}) is equal to the closure of C_{qs}(n_{A}, n_{B}, m_{A}, m_{B}), see the studies of Paulsen and Todorov [5], Fritz [11], and Junge et_al [12], and we denote this common closure by C_{qa}(n_{A}, n_{B}, m_{A}, m_{B}).
The set C_{qc}(n_{A}, n_{B}, m_{A}, m_{B}) is defined by eliminating the tensor product and instead having a single Hilbert space H, a unit vector ψ∈H, together with orthogonal projections E_{x,a},F_{y,b}∈B(H) satisfying
1. E_{x,a}F_{y,b} = F_{y,b}E_{x,a} for all a, b, x, y,
2. ∑a=1m_{A}E_{x,a}=∑b=1m_{B}F_{y,b}=I_{H} for all x, y, and
3. p(a, b|x, y) = ⟨E_{x,a}F_{y,b}ψ, ψ⟩ for all a, b, x, y.In each of the cases, i.e., for t ∈ {q, qs, qa, qc}, when n_{A} = n_{B} = n and m_{A} = m_{B} = m, we set C_{t}(n, m) = C_{t}(n, n, m, m).
A correlation p(a,b|x,y)∈C_{t}(n,m) is called synchronous provided that whenever a ≠ b, p(a, b|x, x) = 0, for all 1 ≤ x ≤ n. For each t, we write Cts(n,m) for the subset of synchronous correlations. Characterizations of synchronous correlations in terms of traces are known for the cases t = q, qc. In Sec. III, we give characterizations of synchronous correlations for the remaining cases, t = qs, qa.
By a finite input-output game, we mean a tuple G=(I_{A},I_{B},O_{A},O_{B},V), where I_{A}, I_{B}, O_{A}, O_{B} are finite sets, representing the inputs that Alice and Bob can receive and the outputs that they can produce, respectively, and a function
called the rule or predicate function. Here V(x, y, a, b) = 1 means that if Alice and Bob receive (x, y) ∈ I_{A} × I_{B} and produce outputs (a, b) ∈ O_{A} × O_{B}, then they win the game, and if V(x, y, a, b) = 0, then they lose the game.
A game is called synchronous provided that I_{A} = I_{B}, O_{A} = O_{B} and the function V satisfies V(x, x, a, b) = 0, for all x and for all a ≠ b.
Given a game, a correlation p(a,b|x,y)∈C_{t}(|I_{A}|,|I_{B}|,|O_{A}|,|O_{B}|) is called a perfect or winning t-correlation, if the probability that it produces a losing output is 0, i.e., provided that whenever V(x, y, a, b) = 0, then p(a, b|x, y) = 0. When a game has a perfect t-correlation, then we say that the game possesses a perfect t-strategy. Note that if a game is synchronous, then any perfect correlation must be synchronous.
From the definition of the set C_{qa}(n_{A}, n_{B}, m_{A}, m_{B}), it readily follows that a game possesses a perfect qa-strategy if and only if for every ϵ > 0 there is a q-correlation p(a,b|x,y) in C_{q}(n_{A}, n_{B}, m_{A}, m_{B}) satisfying V(x, y, a, b) = 0 implies p(a, b|x, y) < ϵ.
Every synchronous game G has an affiliated *-algebra A(G). The algebra A(G) is defined by generators and relations, i.e., it is the quotient of the free algebra on the generators by the 2-sided ideal generated by the relations. This algebra has generators
and relations
1. E_{x,a}=Ex,a*=Ex,a2 for all a and x,
2. ∑a=1mE_{x,a}=I for all x,
3. for all a, b, x, and y, if V(x, y, a, b) = 0, then E_{x,a}E_{y,b} = 0.One of the results of Helton et_al [13] is that a synchronous game G has a perfect q-strategy if and only if A(G) has a unital *-representation as operators on a non-zero, finite dimensional Hilbert space. Thus, a synchronous game G has a perfect q-strategy if and only if one can find projections E_{x,a} on a finite dimensional Hilbert space satisfying the three sets of relations for the given rule V. Similarly, G has a perfect qc-strategy if and only if A(G) has a unital *-representation into a C*-algebra with a trace. The results of Sec. III will show that G has a perfect qa-strategy if and only if A(G) has a unital *-representation on R^{ω}, the tracial ultrapower of the hyperfinite II_{1}-factor R. For readers not familiar with this ultrapower construction, more details can be found in the work of Brown and Ozawa [14] (Appendix A).
There are two families of synchronous games, both involving graphs, that we wish to recall.
Let G = (V, E) be a finite undirected graph without loops. That is, V is a finite set of vertices and E ⊆ V × V denotes the set of edges. Thus, for each v ∈ V, (v,v) ∉ E, and (v,w) ∈ E ⇒ (w,v) ∈ E, it is undirected. We let K_{n} denote the complete graph on n vertices so that (v,w) ∈ E, for all v ≠ w.
Given two graphs G = (V(G), E(G)) and H = (V(H), E(H)), a graph homomorphism from G to H is a function f: V(G) → V(H) satisfying
We write ∃G → H to indicate that there is a graph homomorphism from G to H.
Many graph parameters can be defined in terms of graph homomorphisms. The chromatic number of G is
The clique number of G is
and the independence number of G is
where G¯=(V,E¯) denotes the complement of G, i.e., the graph with the same vertex set but for v≠w,(v,w)∈E¯⇔(v,w)∉E.
Given graphs G and H, the graph homomorphism game from G to H is the synchronous game with inputs V(G), outputs V(H), and rule function
For t ∈ {q, qs, qa, qc}, we say that there is a t-homomorphism from G to H and write ∃G→tH if and only if the graph homomorphism game from G to H has a perfect t-strategy.
In parallel with the above characterizations, we set
It is not hard to verify that for complete graphs
and that
Indeed, by Helton et_al [13], we have that
To see the second set of equalities, note that if K_{c}→tK¯{n} with c > 1, then we would have inputs v ≠ w, and the perfect t-correlation for this game would satisfy p(x, y|v,w) = 0 for every x, y, contradicting ∑_{x,y}p(x, y|v,w) = 1.
Since for t ∈ {q, qs, qa, qc}, χ_{t}(K_{n}) = n, it follows that if there exists a t-homomorphism from K_{n} to K_{c}, then n ≤ c. This in turn implies that
where the last inequality follows since ω_{qc}(K_{c}) is the largest n for which K_{n}→qcK_{c}. Thus, we see that for complete graphs, these quantum analogues all have the same values as their classical counterparts.
The second game that we shall need is the (G, H)-isomorphism game defined in the work of Atserias et_al [9] This game is intended to capture the concept of two graphs being isomorphic. It is a synchronous game with the input set and output set both equal to V(G) ∪ V(H) where we view the vertex sets as disjoint. We refer the reader to the work of Atserias et_al [9] for the rules of this game. For t ∈ {q, qs, qa, qc}, we write G≅_{t}H to indicate that there is a perfect t-strategy for the (G, H)-isomorphism game. In the work of Atserias et_al [9], they only introduced and studied the cases t = q and t = ns (which we have not introduced here).
However, we shall use the fact that since this is a synchronous game, it will have an affiliated *-algebra with generators and relations that can be used to characterize when perfect t-strategies exist. In fact, the generators and relations for the *-algebra of the game are precisely the relations (IQP_{d}) in the work of Atserias et_al [9] We now recall the *-algebra A(G) corresponding to the (G, H)-isomorphism game G. First we need some notation. Given vertices g, g′ ∈ V(G) and h, h′ ∈ V(H), write rel(g, g′) = rel(h, h′) if any of the following holds:
1. g = g′ and h = h′;
2. (g, g′) ∈ E(G) and (h, h′) ∈ E(H);
3. g ≠ g′, (g, g′) ∉ E(G), h ≠ h′, and (h, h′) ∉ E(H),while rel(g, g′) ≠ rel(h, h′) when all three fail to hold. The *-algebra A(G) is generated by elements
subject to the relations
for all g ∈ V(G) and h ∈ V(H) and
for all g, g′ ∈ V(G) and h, h′ ∈ V(H).
We end this preliminary section with some notation that will be used throughout. Let F(n,m) denote the group freely generated by n elements of order m and let C^{*}(F(n,m)) denote the universal group C*-algebra of F(n,m). For x = 1, …, n, let u_{x} be the unitary in C^{*}(F(n,m)) corresponding to the xth generator of F(n,m). If ω_{m} denotes a primitive mth root of unity, then the spectral values of u_{x} are ωmi for i = 1, …, m. Let e_{x,i} denote the projection onto the eigenspace of u_{x} for the spectral value ωmi. Then e_{x,i} is a projection for all x and i and ∑_{i}e_{x,i} = 1 for all x.
Conversely, given a C*-algebra A and projections e_{x,i}∈A for 1 ≤ x ≤ n and 1 ≤ i ≤ n such that ∑_{i}e_{x,i} = 1 for all x, the element v_{x}=∑_{i}ωmie_{x,i} is a unitary in A with order m. Hence there is a unique *-homomorphism C^{*}(F(n,m))→A determined by u_{i} ↦ v_{i}. A straight forward calculation shows that these constructions are inverses of each other and hence C^{*}(F(n,m)) is the universal C*-algebra generated by projections e_{x,i} for 1 ≤ x ≤ n and 1 ≤ j ≤ m such that ∑_{i}e_{x,i} = 1 for all x.
III. CHARACTERIZATIONS OF SYNCHRONOUS STRATEGIES
In the work of Paulsen et_al [6], it was shown that synchronous quantum strategies arise from various families of traces. In particular, it was shown that p(i,j|v,w)∈Cqcs(n,m) if and only if there is a tracial state τ:C^{*}(F(n,m))→C such that p(i, j|v,w) = τ(e_{v,i}e_{w,j}) and p(i,j|v,w)∈Cqs(n,m) if and only if there is a tracial state as before such that in addition the Gel’fand-Naimark-Segal (GNS) representation of C^{*}(F(n,m)),τ is finite dimensional. At the time no characterizations were given of the traces that arise from synchronous quantum spatial correlations or synchronous quantum approximate correlations. In this section, we provide characterizations of these two types of traces.
Definition III.1. LetA⊆B(H)be a C*-algebra. A tracial state τ onAis called amenable provided there is a state ρ onB(H)such thatρ|_{A}=τand ρ(uTu*) = ρ(T) for allT∈B(H)and all unitariesu∈A.By an application of Arveson’s extension theorem, the amenability of τ is independent of the particular choice of a faithful representation of A. The following result is due to Kirchberg [15] (Proposition 3.2) (see also Theorem 6.2.7 in the work of Brown and Ozawa [14]). Here R denotes the hyperfinite II_{1}-factor, ω is a free ultrafilter over the positive integers, and R^{ω} is the corresponding tracial ultrapower. See Appendix A in the work of Brown and Ozawa [14] for the relevant definitions.Recall that given a C*-algebra A, A^{op} denotes the C*-algebra that one obtains by preserving the Banach space structure on A but defining a product ◦ by a ◦ b = ba.
Theorem III.2. SupposeAis a separable C*-algebra and τ is a tracial state onA. The following are equivalent:
1. the tracial state τ is amenable;
2. there is a *-homomorphismφ:A→R^{ω}with a completely positive, contractive liftA→ℓ^{∞}(R)such that tr ◦ φ = τ;
3. there is a sequence of completely positive, contractive mapsφ_{k}:A→M_{d(k)}such that
for alla,b∈A;
4. the linear functionalϕ:A⊗A^{op}→Cdefined by ϕ(a ⊗ b^{op}) = τ(ab) is bounded with respect to the minimal tensor product;The trace in condition (3) is the normalized trace, i.e., for A=(a_{i,j})∈M_{n},tr_{n}(A)=1n∑i=1na_{i,i}, and the norm in condition (3) is the normalized Hilbert-Schmidt norm, i.e., ‖A‖{2}=tr_{n}(A*A){1/2}.In condition (4), note that if ϕ is bounded, then for any x=∑_{i}a_{i}⊗biop we have that
Since ϕ(1 ⊗ 1) = 1, we see that if ϕ is bounded, then ϕ is a state.Recall that C^{*}(F(n,m)) is generated by a set of n unitaries, u_{v}, 1 ≤ v ≤ n, of order m and e_{v,i} denotes the spectral projection of u_{v} corresponding to the spectral value ωmi, where ω_{m} is a primitive mth root of unity.
Lemma III.3. There is a *-isomorphismγ:C^{*}(F(n,m))→C^{*}(F(n,m)){op}withγ(uvj)=uvj,1≤v≤n,1≤j≤m−1. Moreover, γ(e_{v,i}) = e_{v,i}for 1 ≤ v ≤ n and 1 ≤ i ≤ m.
Proof. The words of the form
span a dense *-subalgebra of C^{*}(F(n,m)). If we set
and extend linearly, then it is easily checked that γ extends to the desired *-isomorphism. The second claim is a simple computation.
Lemma III.4. Suppose n ≥ 1 andp∈M_{n}is a positive contraction. If q denotes the spectral projection of p for the interval [1/2, 1], then
Proof. Define p_{0} = (1 − q)p and p_{1} = qp. Note that ‖pi−pi2‖{2}≤‖p−p^{2}‖{2} for i = 0, 1. Since 0≤p_{0}≤12, we have
and hence ‖p0‖{2}≤2‖p0−p02‖{2}. Similarly, since 12q≤p_{1}≤1, we have
and hence ‖p1−q‖{2}≤2‖p1−p12‖{2}. Since p_{0} and p_{1} − q are orthogonal, the result follows from the Pythagorean identity.
Lemma III.5. Given ε > 0 and an integer m ≥ 1, there is a δ > 0 such that for any integer d ≥ 1, ifp_{1},…,p_{m}∈M_{d}are positive contractions with‖pi2−pi‖{2}<δand ∥p_{i}p_{j}∥_{2} < δ for all i, j = 1, …, m with i ≠ j, then there are mutually orthogonal projectionsq_{1},…,q_{m}∈M_{d}such that ∥p_{i} − q_{i}∥_{2} < ε for all i = 1, …, m.If in the statement above we further require ∥∑_{i}p_{i} − 1∥_{2} < δ, then we may arrange for ∑_{i}q_{i} = 1.
Proof. We prove the first statement by induction on m. When m = 1, this is immediate from Lemma III.4. Assume the result holds for an integer m ≥ 1. Fix ε > 0 and define ε_{0} = ε/(40m + 3). Let δ_{0} > 0 be the constant obtained by applying the induction hypothesis to m and ε_{0} and define δ ≔ min {δ_{0}, ε_{0}}. Suppose d ≥ 1 and p_{1},…,p_{m+1}∈M_{d} are positive contractions as above. By the choice of δ, there are mutually orthogonal projections q_{1},…,q_{m}∈M_{d} such that
Since ∥p_{i}p_{m+1}∥_{2} < δ for all i = 1, …, m, we have
Define r = (1 − q_{1} − ⋯ q_{m}) and define p = p_{m+1}. Then
Now, note that
By the previous lemma, if q_{m+1} denotes the spectral projection of rpr corresponding to the interval [1/2, 1], then
Therefore,
Note that each of the projections q_{1}, …, q_{m} are orthogonal to r by construction. As q_{m+1} is a spectral projection of rpr, we also have that each of the projections q_{1}, …, q_{m} is orthogonal to q_{m+1}. This completes the proof of the first part of the lemma.To see if the final sentence holds, fix m ≥ 1 and ε > 0. Let ε_{0} = ε/(m + 2) and let δ_{0} be the constant given by applying the first part of the lemma to m and ε_{0}. Define δ = min{ε_{0}, δ_{0}}. Suppose d ≥ 1 and p_{1},…,p_{m}∈M_{d} are projections such that
for all i, j = 1, …, m with i ≠ j. By the choice of δ, there are mutually orthogonal projections q1′,q_{2},q_{3},…q_{m}∈M_{d} such that ‖p1−q1′‖{2}<ε_{0} and ∥p_{i} − q_{i}∥_{2} < ε_{0} for i = 2, …, m. Now, define q1″=1−q1′−∑i=2mq_{i} and note that ‖q1″‖{2}<(m+1)ε_{0}. To complete the proof, define q_{1}=q1′+q1″.
Theorem III.6. Fix integers n, m ≥ 1. Forp(i,j|v,w)∈R^{n2m2}, the following are equivalent:
1. p(i,j|v,w)∈Cqas(n,m),
2. there are synchronous correlationsp_{k}(i,j|v,w)∈Cqs(n,m)with
3. there is an amenable trace τ onC^{*}(F(n,m))such that
4. there are projectionsf_{v,i}∈R^{ω}such that ∑_{i}f_{v,i} = 1 for allvand
Proof. It is clear that (2) implies (1). To see if (1) implies (3), assume that p(i,j|v,w) is a correlation in Cqas(n,m). There exist correlations p_{k}(i,j|v,w) in C_{q}(n, m) for k ≥ 1 such that
Each p_{k}(i,j,v,w) has a representation on a tensor product of finite dimensional vector spaces C^{dk}⊗C^{rk} as
where the matrices Ev,ik,Fw,jk are all orthogonal projections satisfying ∑_{i}Ev,ik=I_{dk} and ∑_{j}Fw,jk=I_{rk} and each ψ_{k} is a unit vector.Thus there is a representation π_{k}:C^{*}(F(n,m))⊗C^{*}(F(n,m)){op}→M_{dk}⊗M_{rk} with π_{k}(e_{v,i}⊗ew,jop)=Ev,ik⊗Fw,jk. Setting ϕ_{k}(a ⊗ b^{op}) = ⟨π_{k}(a ⊗ b^{op})ψ_{k}, ψ_{k}⟩ defines a sequence of states ϕ_{k} on C^{*}F(n,m)⊗C^{*}(F(n,m)){op}. Let ϕ be any weak *-limit point of (ϕk){k} and note that ϕ(e_{v,i}⊗ew,jop)=p(i,j|v,w).If we let π:C^{*}(F(n,m))⊗_{min}C^{*}(F(n,m)){op}→B(H) and ψ ∈ H be a GNS representation of this state, then it follows by Paulsen et_al [6] (Theorem 5.5) that τ(a) = ⟨π(a ⊗ 1)ψ, ψ⟩ is a trace and that
Hence, π(a ⊗ be{w,j})ψ = π(1 ⊗ b)π(a ⊗ e_{w,j})ψ = π(ae{w,j} ⊗ b)ψ and it follows that
Thus, τ is an amenable trace by Theorem III.2.To see if (3) implies (2), it suffices to show that if τ is an amenable trace on C^{*}(F(n,m)), then there is a sequence of traces τ_{k} on C^{*}(F(n,m)) which factor through a finite dimensional matrix algebra such that τ_{k}(a) → τ(a) for all a∈C^{*}(F(n,m)). Since τ is amenable, Theorem III.2 yields a sequence of completely positive, unital maps φ_{k}:C^{*}(F(n,m))→M_{d(k)} such that
for all a,b∈C^{*}(F(n,m)). By passing to a subsequence and applying Lemma III.5, we may find projections pv,ik∈M_{d(k)} such that ∑_{i}pv,ik=1 for all v and k and such that ‖φk(ev,i)−pv,ik‖{2}→0 for all v and i. There is a *-homomorphism φk′:C^{*}(F(n,m))→M_{d(k)} such that φk′(e_{v,i})=pv,ik for all v, i, and k. Using that C^{*}(F(n,m)) is generated as a C*-algebra by the projections e_{v,i}, one can show
for all a∈C^{*}(F(n,m)). In particular,
for all a∈C^{*}(F(n,m)).To see if (3) implies (4), note that if τ is an amenable trace on C^{*}(F(n,m)), then there is a trace preserving *-homomorphism φ:C^{*}(F(n,m))→R^{ω} by Theorem III.2. Define f_{v,i}=φ(e_{v,i})∈R^{ω} for all v and i. Conversely, given f_{v,i} as in (4), there is a *-homomorphism φ:C^{*}(F(n,m))→R^{ω} such that φ(e_{v,i}) = f_{v,i} for all v and i. As C^{*}(F(n,m)) has the local lifting property, φ has a completely positive, unital lift C^{*}(F(n,m))→ℓ^{∞}(R). By Theorem III.2, the trace τ ≔ tr ◦ φ on C^{*}(F(n,m)) is amenable.
Corollary III.7. LetG=(I,O,V)be a synchronous game. Then the following are equivalent:
(i) Ghas a perfect qa-strategy,
(ii) there is a unital *-representation ofA(G)intoR^{ω},
(iii) there is an amenable trace τ onC^{*}(F(n,m))such that
Corollary III.8. The following are equivalent:
(i) Connes’ embedding conjecture has an affirmative answer,
(ii) Cqas(n,m)=Cqcs(n,m),∀n,m,
(iii) C_{qa}(n, m) = C_{qc}(n, m), ∀n, m.
Proof. The equivalence of (i) and (ii) in Theorem III.6 answers Dykema and Paulsen [8] (Problem 3.8). In the remarks following Problem 3.8, Dykema and Paulsen [8] show how a positive solution of the problem leads to the above result.
Remark III.9. The implication (iii) ⇒ (i) in the above corollary is due to Ozawa [^{10}]. The equivalence of (i) and (ii) follows from the work of Dykema and Paulsen [^{8}](Theorem 3.7) and our solution of their synchronous approximation problem. Note that the implication (iii) implies that (ii) is trivial, so we have a different proof of Ozawa’s implication. Ozawa’s proof uses Kirchberg’s results showing the equivalence of Connes’ embedding conjecture to the equality of the minimal and maximal tensor products of certain C*-algebras of free groups. The above proof uses the results of Dykema and Paulsen [^{8}]which in turn used Kirchberg’s results about the equivalence of Connes’ embedding conjecture to finite approximability of traces, often referred as the matricial microstate conjecture.We next turn our attention to the set of synchronous quantum spatial correlations. We prove the somewhat surprising result that any synchronous correlation that can be obtained using a tensor product of possible infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces has a representation using only finite dimensional spaces.
Theorem III.10. Letn,m∈N. ThenCqs(n,m)=Cqss(n,m).
Proof. Clearly, Cqs(n,m)⊆Cqss(n,m), so we must prove that Cqss(n,m)⊆Cqs(n,m). Let p(i,j|v,w)∈Cqss(n,m) be represented as
where {E_{v,i}, 1 ≤ v ≤ n, 1 ≤ i ≤ m} are orthogonal projections on some Hilbert space H satisfying ∑_{i}E_{v,i}=I_{H},∀v, {F_{w,j}: 1 ≤ w ≤ n, 1 ≤ j ≤ m} are orthogonal projections on some Hilbert space K satisfying ∑_{j}F_{w,j}=I_{K},∀w, and ψ∈H⊗K is a unit vector.Note that if we are given any other Hilbert space G and we set Fw,1′=F_{w,1}⊕I_{G} and Fw,j′=F_{w,j}⊕0, then p(i,j|v,w)=⟨(E_{v,i}⊗Fw,j′)ψ,ψ⟩. In this manner, we see that there is no loss of generality in assuming that dim(H)=dim(K), so we assume that these two Hilbert spaces have the same dimension.Let ∑_{k∈K}α_{k}e_{k} ⊗ f_{k} be the Schmidt decomposition of ψ so that K is a countable set and {e_{k}: k ∈ K} and {f_{k}: k ∈ K} are orthonormal sets in their respective Hilbert spaces. By setting sufficiently many α′s equal to 0, and direct summing with additional Hilbert spaces as needed, we may assume that these sets are orthonormal bases for their respective spaces.Let {r_{l}: l ∈ L} = {α_{k}: k ∈ K} be an enumeration of the set of distinct non-zero α_{k}’s (which is at most countable) with r_{1} > r_{2} > ⋯ and let S_{l} = {k: α_{k} = r_{l}}. Let E_{l}=span{e_{k}:k∈S_{l}} and F_{l}=span{f_{k}:k∈S_{l}}. Since the α_{k}’s are square summable, each set S_{l} is finite and so each of these spaces is finite dimensional.We claim that the spaces E_{l} are reducing subspaces for {E_{v,i}} and that the spaces F_{l} are reducing for the set {F_{w,j}}First, we complete the proof assuming the claim. Let Ev,il denote the compression of E_{v,i} to the space E_{l} and let Fw,jl denote the compression of F_{w,j} to the space F_{l} so that these are orthogonal projections and ∑_{i}Ev,il=IE{l},∀v and ∑_{j}Fw,jl=IF{l},∀w. Set d_{l}=dim(E_{l})=dim(F_{l})=card(S_{l}) and let ψ_{l}=1d_{l}∑_{k∈Sl}e_{k}⊗f_{k}∈E_{l}⊗F_{l}, which is a unit vector. Let t_{l}=rl2d_{l} so that ∑_{l}t_{l}=∑_{k}αk2=1 and set
Note that
so that for i ≠ j, ∑_{l}t_{l}p_{l}(i, j|v,v) = 0 from which it follows that p(i, j|v,v) = 0, ∀l. Thus, each p_{l}(i,j|v,w)∈Cqs(n,m).Since Cqs(n,m) is convex, by Cook and Webster [16],p(i,j|v,w)∈Cqs(n,m). The key point here is that by Cook and Webster [16] a convex set need not be closed to ensure that such a series remains in the set.Thus, we need only establish that these spaces reduce the operators. Let ω = e^{2πi/m} be a primitive mth root of unity and let A_{v}=∑i=1mω^{i}E_{v,i} and let B_{w}=∑j=1mω^{j}F_{w,j} so that these are unitaries of order m and the original projections are the spectral projections of these unitaries. Note that these unitaries generate the same C*-algebras as the projections so that the projections are reduced by these subspaces if and only if these unitaries are reduced by these subspaces.First recall that the synchronous condition guarantees that (E_{v,i} ⊗ I)ψ = (I ⊗ F_{v,i})ψ by Paulsen et_al [6] (Theorem 5.5i) and hence, (A_{v} ⊗ I)ψ = (I ⊗ B_{v})ψ.Now (A ⊗ I)ψ = (I ⊗ B)ψ implies
Thus for i ∈ S_{1}, using that α_{1} ≥ α_{j}, we have
and so we must have equality throughout. But equality implies that ⟨A_{v}e_{j}, e_{i}⟩ = 0, ∀j ∉ S_{1}. Hence, Av*e_{i}∈E_{1},∀i∈S_{1}. This shows that Av* leaves E_{1} invariant. Hence, A_{v}=Av*{m−1} also leaves this space invariant and so E_{1} is a reducing subspace for every A_{v} and hence for the entire C*-algebra that they generate. A similar proof shows that F_{1} is reducing for every B_{v}.Now it follows that for i ∈ S_{2}, we have that for j ∈ S_{1}, ⟨A_{v}e_{j}, e_{i}⟩ = 0 and so,
and similar reasoning shows that Av*e_{i}∈E_{2} and consequently that E_{2} reduces these unitaries.We have now done the first two cases and the complete proof follows by induction along these lines.
Corollary III.11. A synchronous game has a perfect qs-strategy if and only if it has a perfect q-strategy.
IV. SEPARATING Cqss AND Cqas
Suppose Ax = b is an m × n linear system over Z/2; that is, A=(a_{i,j})∈M_{m,n}(Z/2) and b∈(Z/2){n}. Let V_{i} = {j ∈ {1, …, n}: a_{i,j} ≠ 0} denote the variables which occur in the ith equation for i = 1, …, m. It will be convenient to write the system multiplicative notation where we identify Z/2 with {±1} and write the ith equation of the linear system as
for i = 1, …, m, where x_{j} ∈ {±1}. We recall the definition of the solution group Γ(A, b) associated with the system Ax = b. The idea is to interpret (1) as the relations of a group with generators x_{1}, …, x_{n} and a generator J used to place the role of −1. More precisely, we make the following definition.
Definition IV.1. Given an m × n linear system as above, let Γ(A, b) denote the group generated by u_{1}, …, u_{n}, J with relations
1. uj2=J^{2}=1for j = 1, …, n,
2. u_{j}u_{k} = u_{k}u_{j}for j, k ∈ V_{i}and i = 1, …, m,
3. u_{j}J = Ju_{j}for j = 1, …, n, and
4. ∏_{j∈Vi}u_{j}=J^{bi}for i = 1, …, m.We call Γ(A, b) the solution group associated with the linear system Ax = b.For i = 1, …, m, let
We associate a synchronous game to Ax = b as follows:
Definition IV.2. Suppose Ax = b is an m × n linear system overZ/2andb∈(Z/2){n}. The synchronous BCS game associated with Ax = b, denoted synBCS(A, b), is given as follows:
1. the input set isI={1,…,m};
2. the output set isO={±1}{n};
3. given input (i, j), Alice and Bob win on output (x, y) if x ∈ S_{i}, y ∈ S_{j}, and for all k ∈ V_{i} ∩ V_{j}, x_{k} = y_{k}.Let A≅C^{*}(F(m,2^{n})) denote the universal C*-algebra generated by projections e_{i,x} for i = 1, …, m and x ∈ {±1}^{n} subject to the relations ∑_{x}e_{i,x} = 1 for all i = 1, …, m. The following result gives a relationship between correlations in Cqcs(m,2^{n}) and the structure of the group Γ(A, b).
Theorem IV.3. Suppose every column of A contains a non-zero entry. Then there is a surjective *-homomorphismπ:A→C^{*}(Γ(A,b))/⟨J+1⟩,where ⟨J + 1⟩ denotes the ideal generated by J + 1, given by
whereχ_{xj}(u_{j})denotes the spectral projection of u_{j}at the point x_{j}.Moreover, the map τ ↦ τ ◦ π is a bijection from the set of tracial states on C*(Γ(A, b))/⟨J + 1⟩ to the set of tracial states τ′ onAsatisfying τ′(e_{i,x}e_{j,y}) = 0 whenever Alice and Bob lose on outputs (x, y) given inputs (i, j).
Proof. First we show that the formula for π given in (2) defines a *-homomorphism on A. Note that since {u_{j}: j ∈ V_{i}} is a set of commuting self-adjoint unitaries, π(e_{i,x}) is defined and is a projection for each i and x. Moreover, for i = 1, …, m, in the algebra C*(Γ(A, b))/⟨J + 1⟩,
Moreover, note that if x∈{±1}{Vi} and ∏_{j∈Vi}x_{j}≠(−1){bi}, then
and hence ∏_{j∈Vi}x_{j}χ_{xj}(u_{j})=0. Combining these calculations, we have
and hence
Thus the desired *-homomorphism π exists.To see if π is surjective, fix k ∈ {1, …, m}. As the kth column of A contains a non-zero entry, there is an i ∈ {1, …, m} such that k ∈ V_{i}. Note that
As C*(Γ(A, b))/⟨J + 1⟩ is generated by u_{1}, …, u_{m}, the result follows.We next work to prove the claim about traces. As π is surjective, the induced map on traces is injective. To see surjectivity, let τ′ be a trace on A such that τ′(e_{i,x}e_{j,y}) = 0 if x ∉ S_{i}, y ∉ S_{j}, or there is a k ∈ V_{i} ∩ V_{j} such that x_{k} ≠ y_{k}. Define
and note that N is an ideal in A. We first show the following:
1. if x ∉ S_{i}, then e_{i,x}∈N,
2. if x_{k} ≠ y_{k} for some k ∈ V_{i} ∩ V_{j}, then e_{i,x}e_{j,y}∉N, and
3. if k ∈ V_{i} ∩ V_{j}, then ∑x∈S_{i}x_{k}e_{i,x}−∑y∈S_{j}y_{k}e_{i,x}∈N.For (1), if x ∉ S_{i}, then τ^{′}(ei,x*e_{i,x})=τ^{′}(e_{i,x}e_{i,x})=0 by the assumptions on τ′. For (2), if x_{k} ≠ y_{k} for some k ∈ V_{i} ∩ V_{j}, then
by the assumptions on τ′. For (3), fix k ∈ V_{i} ∩ V_{j}. Then
by (2) above. Also,
by (1) above. Now,
which proves (3).Fix k ∈ {1, …, n}. Since the jth column of A is non-zero, there is an i ∈ {1, …, m} such that k ∈ V_{i}. Define v_{k}∈A/N by
By condition (3) above, the v_{k} is independent of the choice of i. Note that v_{k} is a self-adjoint unitary in A/N and if k, ℓ ∈ V_{i} for some i = 1…m, then v_{k}v_{ℓ} = v_{ℓ}v_{k}. Finally for i = 1, …, m, since the projections e_{i,x} are orthogonal, we have
It follows that there is a group homomorphism ρ:Γ(A,b)→U(A/N) given by ρ(u_{k}) = v_{k} and ρ(J) = −1. Now, ρ induces a *-homomorphism, still denoted ρ, from C*(Γ(A, b))/⟨J + 1⟩ to A/N.Let q:A→A/N denote the quotient map. Since τ′ vanishes on N, there is a trace τ¯{′} on A/N such that τ¯{′}◦q=τ^{′}. Define a trace τ on C*(Γ(A, b))/⟨J + 1⟩ by τ=τ¯{′}◦ρ. By construction, ρ(π(e_{i,x})) = q(e_{i,x}) for all i and x and hence ρ ◦ π = q. Now, τ◦π=τ¯{′}◦ρ◦π=τ¯{′}◦q=τ^{′}. This completes the proof.
Corollary IV.4. Let Ax = b be a linear system.
1. synBCS(A, b) has a perfect qc-strategy if and only if J ≠ 1 in Γ(A, b),
2. synBCS(A, b) has a perfect qa-strategy if and only if there is representationΓ(A,b)→R^{ω}such that ρ(J) ≠ 1, and
3. synBCS(A, b) has a perfect q-strategy if and only if there is a finite dimensional representationρ:Γ(A,b)→U(M_{d})such that ρ(J) ≠ 1.
Proof. We may assume that no column of A is identically zero. Assume A is an m × n linear system.We first prove (1). If synBCS(A, b) has a perfect qc-strategy p(x,y|i,j)∈Cqcs(m,2^{n}), there is a trace τ on A such that
By Theorem IV.3, there is a trace τ′ on C*(Γ(A, b))/⟨J + 1⟩ such that τ′◦ π = τ. In particular, C*(Γ(A, b))/⟨J + 1⟩ is non-zero. Hence J + 1 ≠ 2 in C*(Γ(A, b)) and J ≠ 1 in Γ(A, b).Conversely, suppose J ≠ 1 in Γ(A, b). As J is central, ⟨J⟩≅Z/2 is a normal subgroup of Γ(A, b). There is a conditional expectation E:C^{*}(Γ(A,b))→C^{*}(⟨J⟩)≅C^{2} determined by E(s) = s for s ∈ {1, J} and E(s) = 0 for s ∈ Γ(A, b)∖{1, J}. Let χ:C^{*}(⟨J⟩)→C be the character defined by χ(J) = −1. Then χ ◦ E is a trace on C*(Γ(A, b)). As (χ ◦ E)(J + 1) = 0 and J + 1 ≥ 0, the trace χ ◦ E vanishes on the ideal ⟨J + 1⟩ ⊆ C*(Γ(A, b)) and hence induces a trace τ on C*(Γ(A, b))/⟨J + 1⟩. Now, the trace τ ◦ π on A is a trace where π is the surjection in Theorem IV.3. We define a qc-correlation by
By Theorem IV.3, p(x,y|i,j) is a perfect qc-strategy.For (2) and (3), we let B denote either R^{ω} or M_{d}. Suppose ρ:Γ(A,b)→U(B) is a group homomorphism such that ρ(J) ≠ 1. Let q denote the spectral projection of ρ(J) corresponding to the eigenvalue −1. As J ≠ 1, we have q ≠ 0. As J is central in Γ(A, b), the projection q commutes with the image of ρ. Now, qρ(·) is a unitary representation of Γ(A, b) on U(qBq) and qρ(J) = −q. When B=M_{d}, qBq≅M_{d^{′}} for some d′≥ 1, and when B=R^{ω}, qBq≅R^{ω}. Hence after replacing B with qBq and ρ with qρ(·), we may assume ρ(J) = −1. Now ρ induces a *-homomorphism C^{*}(Γ(A,b))→B vanishing on J + 1 and hence induces a *-homomorphism
The trace on B defines a trace on A which in turn defines a winning q-strategy when B is finite dimensional and a winning qa-strategy when B=R^{ω}.Now suppose synBCS(A, b) has a perfect qa-strategy. As in Theorem IV.3, there is a trace τ on C*(Γ(A, b))/⟨J + 1⟩ which factors through the trace on R^{ω}. The GNS representation of τ induces a representation of C^{*}(Γ(A,b))/⟨J+1⟩→R^{ω} which in turn induces a representation ρ:Γ(A,b)→R^{ω} with ρ(J) = −1. Similarly, if synBCS(A, b) has a perfect q-strategy, one produces a representation of Γ(A, b) in the same way using a finite dimensional algebra in place of R^{ω}.The following result is in the work of Slofstra [3].
Theorem IV.5. There is a linear system Ax = b such that there is a representationρ:Γ(A,b)→U(R^{ω})such that ρ(J) ≠ 1 but for every finite dimensional representationρ_{0}:Γ(A,b)→U(M_{d}), ρ(J) = 1.Combining Theorem IV.5 with Corollary IV.4 provides a synchronous game which has a perfect qa-strategy but no perfect q-strategy. Hence we have the following strengthening of Slofstra’s result [3].
Corollary IV.6. For sufficiently large m and n, we haveCqs(m,2^{n})=Cqss(m,2^{n})≠Cqas(m,2^{n}). In particular, for sufficiently large m, n, Cqs(m,2^{n})=Cqss(m,2^{n})is not closed.
Remark IV.7. If each row of the matrix A appearing in the above result has only k non-zero entries, then one can deduce thatCqs(m,2^{k})=Cqss(m,2^{k})is not closed.
Remark IV.8. If C_{qs}(m, 2^{n}) or C_{q}(m, 2^{n}) was closed, then their subsets of synchronous elements would be closed. SinceCqs(m,2^{n})=Cqss(m,2^{n}), the above result implies Slofstra’s result [^{3}]that C_{q}(m, 2^{n}) and C_{qs}(m, 2^{n}) are not closed, for sufficiently large m, n. It is not clear if there is any direct proof of the converse, i.e., that the non-closure of the sets C_{qs}(m, 2^{n}) and C_{q}(m, 2^{n}) implies that their synchronous subsets are not closed.
V. SEPARATING QUANTUM INDEPENDENCE NUMBERS OF GRAPHS
In this section, we prove that there exists a graph G for which α_{q}(G) < α_{qa}(G). Recall from Sec. II that for t ∈ {q, qa, qc}, the independence number α_{t}(G) is the largest c ≥ 1 for which the graph homomorphism game K_{c}→G¯ has a perfect t-strategy.
First let us recall from the work of Atserias et_al [9] (Sec. 6) the graph G_{A,b} defined for a linear system Ax = b over Z/2.
Definition V.1. Suppose Ax = b is an m × n linear system overZ/2andb∈(Z/2){n}. Define a graph G_{A,b}with the following data:
1. the vertices of G_{A,b}are pairs (i, x), where i ∈ {1, …, m} and x ∈ S_{i};
2. there is an edge between distinct vertices (i, x) and (j, y) if and only if there exists some k ∈ V_{i} ∩ V_{j}for which x_{i} ≠ y_{j}; that is, x and y are inconsistent solutions.
Lemma V.2. Suppose t ∈ {q, qa, qc}. If G and H are finite graphs and G≅_{t}H, then α_{t}(G) = α_{t}(H).
Proof. Let V = V (G) ∪ V (H). It suffices to show that if G≅_{t}H, then whenever α_{t}(G) ≥ c, we also have α_{t}(H) ≥ c. As α_{t}(G) ≥ c, we have K_{c}→tG¯. The C*-algebra of this synchronous game is a C*-algebra A, with a tracial state τ_{A} on A, and projections e_{i,v}∈A for i = 1, …, c and v ∈ V (G) such that ∑_{v}e_{i,v} = 1 for all i = 1, …, c and τ(e_{i,v}e_{j,w}) = 0 whenever (v,w) ∈ E(G). If t = q, we may assume that τ_{A} factors through a finite dimensional algebra and if t = qa, we may assume that τ_{A} is amenable.Similarly, since G≅_{t}H, there is a C*-algebra B, a tracial state τ_{B} on B, and projections q_{v,w}∈B for v, w ∈ V such that ∑_{w∈V}q_{v,w} = 1 for all v ∈ V and such that if v, w ∈ V (G) and x, y ∈ V (H) with rel(v,w) ≠ rel(x, y), then τ_{B}(q_{vx}q_{wy}) = 0. (Note that there are other relations in the graph isomorphism game; these are the only ones we will need to use here.) Again we choose τ_{B} to factor through a finite dimensional algebra if t = q and we choose τ_{B} to be amenable if t = qa.For i = 1, …, c and x ∈ V (H), define
Then each f_{i,x} is a projection and for all i = 1, …, c, we have ∑_{x}f_{i,x} = 1. If x, y ∈ V(H) and (x, y) ∈ E(H), then
For v,w ∈ V (G), if (v,w) ∈ E(G), then τ_{A}(e_{i,v}e_{j,w})=0, and if (v,w) ∉ E(G), then τ_{B}(f_{v,x}f_{w,y})=0. Hence the projections f_{i,x}∈A⊗B and the trace τ_{A}⊗τ_{B} determine a perfect qc-strategy for the graph homomorphism game from K_{c} to H¯. If τ_{A} and τ_{B} factor through finite dimensional algebras, so does τ_{A} ⊗ τ_{B}. If τ_{A} and τ_{B} are amenable, so is τ_{A} ⊗ τ_{B}. Hence in all cases, α_{t}(H) ≥ c.It is shown in the work of Ortiz and Paulsen [7] (Theorem 3.7) that for t ∈{q, qa, qc} and graphs G, H and K, if G→tH and H→tK, then G→tK. This leads to the following:
Proposition V.3. If t ∈ {q, qa, qc} and G is a finite graph, thenα_{t}(G)≤χ_{t}(G¯).
Proof. Suppose that α_{t}(G) = c. By definition, there is a t-homomorphism K_{c}→tG¯. If χ_{t}(G¯)=d, then there is a t-homomorphism, G¯→tK_{d}. Since qa-homomorphisms are closed under composition, there is a t-homomorphism K_{c}→tK_{d} which implies that χ_{t}(K_{c}) ≤ d. As noted in Sec. II, χ_{t}(K_{c}) = c and hence c ≤ d as claimed.In the case t = q, the following result appears as Theorem 6.2 in the work of Atserias et_al [9]
Theorem V.4. Suppose t ∈ {q, qa, qc} and let Ax = b be an m × n linear system. The following are equivalent:
1. the game synBCS(A, b) has a winning t-strategy;
2. G_{A,b}≅_{t}G_{A,0};
3. α_{t}(G_{A,b}) = m.
Proof. (1) ⇒ (2): Suppose that we have a winning t-strategy for the synBCS(A,b). Fix a C*-algebra B, a faithful trace τ∈B, and projections e_{i,x}∈B for i = 1, …, m and x ∈ {±1}^{n} such that ∑_{x}e_{i,x} = 1 for all i, e_{i,x} = 0 if x ∉ S_{i}, and e_{i,x}e_{j,y} = 0 if there is a k ∈ V_{i} ∩ V_{j} with x_{k} ≠ y_{k}. If t = q, we assume that B is finite dimensional and if t = qa, we assume that B⊆R^{ω}. Let G be the isomorphism game for (G_{A,b}, G_{A,0}) and let A(G) denote the algebra associated with G as defined in Sec. II. It suffices to construct a unital *-homomorphism π:A(G)→B.Let Si0⊆{±1}{n} denote the set of solutions to the ith equation of the linear system Ax = 0 and let Si1⊆{±1}{n} denote the set of solutions to the ith equation of the linear system Ax = b. Given x, y ∈ {±1}^{n}, let xy ∈ {±1}^{n} denote the pointwise product of x and y. Note that if x∈Si0 and y∈Si0, then xy∈Si1. Moreover, for x∈Si1, the map Si0→Si1 given by y ↦ xy is a bijection.For (i, x) ∈ V (G_{A,b}) and (j, y) ∈ V (G_{A,0}), define
and note that each q_{(i,x),(j,y)} is a projection. For (i, x) ∈ V (G_{A,b}), we have
A similar computation shows that for all (j, y) ∈ V (G_{A,0}), we have
We need to show that for all (i, x), (i′, x′) ∈ V (G_{A,b}) and (j, y), (j′, y′) ∈ V (G_{A,0}), the implication
holds. To this end, suppose q_{(i,x),(j,y)}q_{(i^{′},x^{′}),(j^{′},y^{′})}≠0. Then i = j, i′ = j′, and e_{i,xy}e_{i^{′},x^{′}y^{′}}≠0. We consider several cases.Suppose first i = i′. Then we have xy = x′y′. If x = x′, then y = y′ and we have both (i, x) = (i′, x′) and (j, y) = (j′, y′) so the right-hand side of the implication holds in the case. Conversely, if x ≠ x′ and y ≠ y′, then (i, x) ≠ (i′, x′) and (j, y) ≠ (j′, y′). Note also that since i = i′, x and x′ are necessarily inconsistent solutions so that (i, x) and (i′, x′) are adjacent. Similar reasoning shows (j, y) and (j′, y′) are adjacent. Hence the right-hand side of the implication holds.Now assume i ≠ i′ so that, in particular, (i, x) ≠ (i′, x′). If (i, x) and (i′, x′) are adjacent, there is a k∈V_{i}∩V_{i^{′}} such that x_{k}≠xk′. On the other hand, as e_{i,xy}e_{i^{′},x^{′}y^{′}}≠0, we know x_{k}y_{k}=(xy){k}=(x^{′}y^{′}){k}=xk′yk′. Therefore, y_{k}≠yk′ so that (i, y) and (i′, y′) are adjacent. Finally, suppose (i, x) and (i′, x′) are not adjacent. Then x_{k}=xk′ for all i∈V_{i}∩V_{i^{′}}. Again since e_{i,xy}e_{i^{′},x^{′}y^{′}}≠0, we also know x_{k}y_{k}=xk′yk′ for all k∈V_{i}∩V_{i^{′}} and therefore y_{k}=yk′ for all k∈V_{i}∩V_{i^{′}} so that (j, y) and (j′, y′) are not adjacent. This covers all cases.Now, the projections q_{(i,x),(j,y)}∈B define a unital *-representation π:A(G)→B and it follows that G_{A,b}≅_{t}G_{A,0}.(2) ⇒ (3): Suppose that G_{A,b}≅_{t}G_{A,0}. By Lemma V.2, it suffices to show that α_{t}(G_{A,0}) = m. The map f:G_{A,0}¯→{1,…,m}:(i,x)↦i is an m-colouring of G_{A,0}¯. Indeed, suppose (i, x) and (j, y) are distinct vertices in G_{A,0}¯ with f(i, x) = f(j, y). Then i = j and hence x ≠ y. That is, there is some k ∈ V_{i} such that x_{k} ≠ y_{k} and thus there is no edge between (i, x) and (j, y) in G_{A,0}¯.For each i = 1, …, m, the vector x_{0} = (1, …, 1) is in S_{i} ⊆ {±1}^{n} for the system Ax = 0. Hence for i, j = 1, …, m, there is no edge between the vertices (i, x_{0}) and (j, x_{0}) in G_{A,0}¯ and we have α(G_{A,0}) ≥ m. Now by the previous proposition,
and α_{t}(G_{A,0}) = m.(3) ⇒ (1): Suppose α_{t}(G_{A,b}) = m. Then the graph homomorphism game from K_{m} to G_{A,b}¯ has a perfect t-strategy. Fix a C*-algebra A with a faithful trace τ and projections e_{i,k,x}∈A for k = 1, …, m, v ∈ V (G_{A,b}) such that
1. ∑k=1m∑x∈S_{k}e_{i,k,,x}=1 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ m and
2. τ(e_{i,k,x}e_{ℓ,j,y}) = 0 if there is an edge between (k, x) and (j, y) in G_{A,b}.If t = q, we may assume A is finite dimensional and if t = qa, we may assume A=R^{ω}.Define for i = 1, …, m and j ∈ V_{i},
and note that v_{i,j} is a self-adjoint unitary since ∑_{k,x}e_{i,k,x} = 1 and for all j, we have x_{j} ∈ {±1}. Also, v_{i,j} and v_{i,k} commute for all i, j, k = 1, …, m.For all i, k and j ∈ V_{i} ∩ V_{k},
Note that when x_{j} ≠ y_{j}, there is an edge between (p, x) and (q, y) in G_{A,b} and hence τ(e_{i,p,x}e_{k,q,y}) = 0. Moreover, when x_{j} = y_{j}, x_{j}y_{j} = 1. Hence we have
Now, for i, k = 1, …, m and j ∈ V_{i} ∩ V_{k}, we have
and hence v_{i,j} = v_{k,j} as τ is faithful.Given j = 1, …, n, define w_{j} = v_{i,j} if j ∈ V_{i} for some i = 1, …, m and w_{j} = 1 otherwise. By the previous paragraph, this is well defined. If 1 ≤ j, k ≤ n and there is an i = 1, …, m with j, k ∈ V_{i}, then w_{j} = v_{i,j} and w_{k} = v_{i,k} commute. Moreover, for each i = 1, …, m,
Hence there is a representation ρ:Γ(A,b)→U(A) such that ρ(u_{i}) = w_{i} and ρ(J) = −1 for all i = 1, …, n. By Corollary IV.4, the game synBCS(A, b) has a perfect t-strategy which proves (1).
Corollary V.5. There exists a graph G for which α_{qa}(G) > α_{q}(G).
Corollary V.6. There exist graphs G and H for which G≅_{qa}H but G≇_{q}H.
