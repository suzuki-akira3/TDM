Short-crested, cnoidal, and solitary wave forces on composite bucket foundation for an offshore wind turbine
The analytical solutions for the diffraction of the short-crested wave, the cnoidal wave, and the solitary wave incident on a composite bucket foundation of an offshore wind turbine are derived in this paper. The analytical expressions for the pressure, wave run-up, and wave force on the composite bucket foundation are obtained. Based on the numerical results, it is found that the short-crested wave run-up is affected by the wave phase, the cnoidal wave run-up is affected by the wave parameter λ, and the solitary wave run-up is affected by the wave parameter χ. For a composite bucket foundation, the long-crested wave force is larger than the short-crested wave force and the solitary wave force is larger than cnoidal wave force in certain shallow water conditions. Moreover, the short-crested wave force may first increase and then decrease with the increase in the water depth, while the cnoidal wave force and the solitary wave force monotonically increase with the increase in the water depth. In the design of the offshore wind turbine with composite bucket foundation, it will be more conservative if the formula derived from the plane waves is used as design criteria in a short-crested sea, and the wave force in shallow water should be determined by the solitary wave and the cnoidal wave together.
I. INTRODUCTION
Wind energy is one kind of renewable energy and has been widely used in various areas. Since 2001, wind energy industry has developed with an annual capacity growth rate of 20% to 30% ( [Li and Duan, 2016a]). The capacity of one single wind turbine has currently reached 5 MW and will even target 10 MW in the near future. Compared to western countries, the wind energy industry in China started relatively late. In recent years, a large number of offshore wind-farms have already been installed, under construction or being planned in China ( [Zhang et_al, 2011] and  [Li and Duan, 2016b]). There are several types of offshore wind turbine structures, which are widely used in the development of offshore wind powers, including monopole, gravity-base, tripod, and jacket structures and suction caisson foundations ( [Byrne and Houlsby, 2003]). A new kind of suction foundation called composite bucket foundation was proposed by Tianjin University for offshore wind turbines ( [Lian et_al, 2011] and  [Zhang et_al, 2013],  [2014],  [2016]), as shown in Fig. 1, and there is also an application in the Daoda composite bucket foundation offshore wind turbine ( [Zhang et_al, 2014]). The composite bucket foundation takes full advantage of the high tensile capacity of the steel strand and the high compressive capacity of the concrete, which can transfer the large moment and horizontal shear forces from the tower to the foundation through the pre-stressing arc transition component. In addition, the composite bucket foundation has the advantages of reducing construction costs and shorting construction time compared to conventional foundations.
Ocean wave is one of the dominated forms of loads generally encountered in an offshore environment, and it has a great influence on the safety of the offshore wind power structure. Therefore, to safely design these offshore wind turbines, it is critical to appropriately evaluate the wave load on the large-scale composite bucket foundation.  [Lian et_al (2016)] proposed an analytical solution for calculating the wave force on the large-scale composite bucket foundation subjected to linear plane waves, and it was also verified by the experimental results. However, waves generated by winds in the oceans are much better modelled by short-crested waves than by plane waves. Additionally, the wave forces on this new composite bucket foundation in shallow water are not well studied.
The estimation of the wave loads on the large-scale offshore structure whose presence affects the incident wave is based on the diffraction theory developed by  [MacCamy and Fuchs (1954)]. They derived the analytical solution for linear plane waves being diffracted around a large vertical circular cylinder. The analytical results have been proven with experiments by many researchers ( [Chakrabatri and Tam, 1975] and  [Neelamani et_al, 1989]). Thereafter, the diffraction theory is generally applied to calculate the wave force on a large-scale structure. For linear plane wave diffraction problems,  [Chen and Mei (1973)] and  [Williams (1985)] proposed analytical solutions for the wave loads on elliptical cylinders, and  [Liu et_al (2016)] proposed an analytical solution for the wave loads on vertical cylinders with a smooth cross-section. In addition, the boundary element method ( [Au and Brebbia, 1983] and  [Kim et_al, 2007]) and the scaled boundary finite-element method ( [Li et_al, 2006] and  [Song et_al, 2010]) were developed for the wave loads on a vertical cylinder with complex shapes.
In fact, most waves generated by wind blowing the water surface in the oceans are short-crested. Short-crested waves exhibit many different properties compared to plane waves ( [Roberts, 1983]), and they can be doubly periodic in two horizontal directions, one in the direction of propagation and the other normal to it. Many researchers have studied the short-crested wave diffraction around large-scale vertical cylinders.  [Zhu (1993)] developed an exact solution for the diffraction of the short-crested wave incident on vertical circular cylinders. Based on the boundary finite method,  [Zhu and Moule (1994)] discussed the wave load induced by the short-crested wave on vertical cylinders with an arbitrary cross-section.  [Zhu and Satravaha (1995)] proposed an analytical solution for the second-order forces induced by the short-crested wave. Based on the scaled boundary finite-element method,  [Tao et_al (2007)] studied the short-crested waves diffracted by a vertical circular cylinder.
For the case of shallow water, there are limited studies about cnoidal wave or solitary wave diffraction around large-scale vertical cylinders. For the cnoidal wave,  [Isaacson (1977],  [1978)] expressed the incident potential in terms of a Fourier series and gave the analytical solution for the diffraction of the cnoidal wave incident on a vertical circular cylinder. Later,  [Isaacson (1983)] extended his study to investigate the solitary waves interacting with a vertical circular cylinder by assuming a Fourier integral transform with a first approximation. Moreover,  [Su and Pan (1987)],  [Wang et_al (1992)],  [Wang and Jiang (1994)],  [Jiang and Wang (1995)], and  [Wang and Ren (1999)] carried out systematic analyses of solitary waves and cnoidal waves interacting with a vertical circular cylinder or a group of circular cylinders.
However, to the best of the author's knowledge, none seem to investigate the diffraction of the short-crested wave incident on a composite bucket foundation and the diffraction of the shallow water wave incident on a composite bucket foundation by using the analytical, experimental, or numerical method. The purpose of this study is mainly to derive the analytical solutions for the diffraction of the short-crested wave, cnoidal wave, and solitary wave by a composite bucket foundation. This study will provide a useful guide for the design of offshore wind turbines.
II. FORMULATION AND SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM
The model of the composite bucket foundation investigated in this study is first given by  [Lian et_al (2016)]. The composite bucket foundation is assumed to be rigid and placed on the seafloor as shown in Fig. 2. In the Cartesian coordinate system in Fig. 2, the wave is assumed to propagate along the positive x-axis, while the z-axis is the vertical axis originated from the seabed. As shown in Fig. 2, O is the origin of the Cartesian coordinate system and O_{1} is the circle center of the arc transition. The cylindrical coordinate system O-rθz is also defined, and r is the radial axis. In the cylindrical coordinate system, the arc transition equation of the surface of composite bucket foundation is expressed as
The following notations are used in this paper: t is the time variable; g is the gravitational acceleration; d is the water depth; ρ is the water density; k is the total wave number; H is the wave height; ω is the wave frequency; and a is the radius of the composite bucket foundation at z.
A. Governing equations and boundary conditions
The fluid is assumed to be incompressible, inviscid, and irrotational. The total velocity potential function ϕ can be divided into two parts, named as the incident wave velocity potential ϕ_{I}(r,θ,z,t) and the scattered velocity potential ϕ_{S}(r,θ,z,t). With the above assumptions, the velocity potential ϕ should satisfy the following Laplace equation and the boundary conditions in the cylindrical coordinate system
where n denotes the normal of the foundation.
The scattered wave ϕ_{S} should satisfy the radiation condition at infinity as
where i=−1.
B. Solution for the short-crested wave
For short-crested incident waves traveling in the positive x-direction, the velocity potential can be expressed as the real part given by  [Fuchs (1952)]
in which θ_{0} is the phase of the sinusoidal wave crests in the direction perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation, k_{x} and k_{y} are the wave numbers in the x-direction and the y-direction, and k=kx2+ky2 is the total wave number which satisfies the dispersion relation
The wave velocity of short-crested waves propagating in the x-direction is given by
The velocity potential given in Eq. (7) can be rewritten as
where β=arccos(k_{n}/k), ε_{0}=1, and ε_{n}=2i^{n} for n≥1 and J_{n} is the Bessel function of the first kind of order n.
Substituting Eq. (10) into Eqs. (2) and (5), the solution for the scattered wave is expressed as
in which A_{n} and B_{n} are undetermined coefficients, Hn(1) is the Hankel function of the first kind of order n, and the prime denotes a derivative with respect to the argument.
Thus, the total velocity potential in the wave field can be expressed as
In order to determine coefficients A_{n} and B_{n}, Eq. (5) can be rewritten as
in which α_{0}, β_{0}, and γ_{0} are the angles between the external normal of the foundation and the r-axis, z-axis, and θ-axis, respectively. According to Eq. (1), α_{0}, β_{0}, and γ_{0} can be obtained as follows:
(15) 
where
Substituting Eqs. (12) and (15) into Eq. (14), A_{n} and B_{n} can be rendered as follows:
Appling the total velocity potential (12), the total free surface displacement on the surface of the composite bucket foundation is given by
The pressure can be calculated from the linearized Bernoulli equation, p=−ρ∂ϕ∂t. The pressure at any point on the surface of the composite bucket foundation is given by
The force components per unit length in the direction of the positive x-axis and y-axis are given by
Given the orthogonality of cosines and sines, the final expressions of dF_{x}/dz and dF_{y}/dz can be written as
where
Therefore, the total force components of the composite bucket foundation, F_{x} and F_{y}, are given by
Furthermore, the total force of the composite bucket foundation, F_{T}, can be obtained by
For a plane wave with wave number k, all the physical quantities, such as pressure and free surface wave elevation, can be obtained by letting k_{x}→k and θ_{0}→0. For a fixed total wave number k, as the wavelength decreases in the direction perpendicular to the wave propagation or increases in the direction parallel to the wave propagation, that is, the waves become shorter.
C. Solution for the cnoidal wave
The first approximation of velocity potential of incident cnoidal wave ϕ_{I} is derived by Isaacson in 1977 as
with
where κ is the modulus of the Jacobian elliptic function; κ^{′}=1−κ^{2}; K(κ) is the complete elliptical integral of the first kind. Modulus κ can be determined by the following equation:
Define wave parameter λ=Hk^{2}d^{3}, and then, the values of κ are obtained from Eq. (29), given certain values of λ.
In the cylindrical coordinate system, the velocity potential ϕ_{I} can be expressed as
Moreover, the velocity potential of scattered wave ϕ_{S} can be calculated as follows: Considering Eq. (6) and utilizing the method of eigenfunction expansion, velocity potential of scattered wave ϕ_{S} can be expressed as
in which A_{mn} is an unknown coefficient.
By substituting incident wave potential ϕ_{I} of Eq. (30) and the scattered wave potential ϕ_{S} of Eq. (31) into the surface boundary condition of Eq. (14), the coefficient A_{mn} can be represented by
Thus, the total wave potential can be written as
The total free surface displacement on the surface of the composite bucket foundation is expressed as
The pressure at any point on the surface of the composite bucket foundation is expressed as
The force components per unit length in the direction of the positive x-axis and y-axis are expressed as
The total force of the composite bucket foundation is expressed as
D. Solution for the solitary wave
The solution of the velocity potential of incident solitary wave ϕ_{I} ( [Isaacson, 1983]) can be expressed as
in which the wave velocity is given as c=gd.
In the cylindrical coordinate system, the velocity potential of solitary wave ϕ_{I} is expressed as
Considering Eq. (6) and utilizing the method of eigenfunction expansion, velocity potential of scattered wave ϕ_{S} is expressed as
in which Bn1 and Bn2 are unknown coefficients. Hn(2) is the Hankel function of the second kind of order n.
By substituting incident wave potential ϕ_{I} of Eq. (40) and scattered wave potential ϕ_{S} of Eq. (41) into the surface boundary condition of Eq. (14), the coefficients Bn1 and Bn2 can be represented by
So, the total wave potential can be written as
The total free surface displacement on the surface of the composite bucket foundation is obtained as
Defining parameters χ=Ha02/d^{3} and t_{0}=gHt/d, Eq. (45) can be rewritten as
The pressure at any point on the surface of the composite bucket foundation can be expressed as
The force components per unit length in the direction of the positive x-axis can be obtained as
The total force of the composite bucket foundation can be obtained as
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Short-crested wave
Figures 3 and 4 show the dimensional run-up η/H of short-crested waves on the composite bucket foundation against variable θ/π for different k_{n}/k and ka_{0} values with d =6 m in the cases of θ_{0} = 0° and θ_{0} = 45°, respectively, where a_{0} denotes the radius of the composite bucket foundation at z =0. It can be seen that the wave run-up on the foundation is quite different when the incident waves become short-crested or the wave phase θ_{0} and ka_{0} change. As can be seen from Figs. 3 and 4, for θ_{0} = 0 and a fixed k_{x}/k, the waves near the front side of the foundation, namely θ = π, have the largest amplitude which decreases as the waves become shorter. The amplitude of the waves reduced to a minimum when k_{x} = 0 and k_{y} = k. Under this circumstance, the incident short-crested wave becomes a standing wave in the y-direction and the wave run-up is symmetric in the θ direction. However, for the case of θ_{0} = 45° and a fixed k_{x}/k, the monotonically decreasing pattern of the wave run-up is not observed from the results and the largest amplitude does not necessary occur near the front side of the foundation. From these two figures, it can also be seen that the largest amplitude of the wave run-up induced by the long-crested (k_{x} = k) wave is larger than that induced by the short-crested wave.
Figure 5 illustrates the variation of the total horizontal short-crested wave force on the composite bucket foundation versus ka_{0} for different k_{x}/k and θ_{0} values with d =6 m. For different values of k_{x}/k and θ_{0}, it is observed that the wave force always first reaches a maximum value at a low frequency and then decreases gradually. For θ_{0} = 0 and θ_{0} = 45°, the wave force decreases when the wave becomes shorter. For θ_{0} = 90°, the wave force induced by the long-crested wave is consistent with the wave force induced by the standing wave. Therefore, one can conclude that the maximum wave load on the composite bucket foundation is achieved when the incident waves are the long-crested waves (plane waves). In other words, it will be more conservative for the composite bucket foundation if the formula derived from the plane waves is used to estimate the wave forces in a short-crested sea.
Unlike long-crested waves, the wave force induced by the short-crested waves varies with the phase angle θ_{0}. Figure 6 illustrates the variation of the short-crested wave force on the composite bucket foundation versus wave phase θ_{0} for different k_{x}/k values with ka_{0} = 1 and d =6m. It can be seen that the total wave force on the foundation varies sinusoidally with θ_{0}, whereas the force components in the x-direction and the y-direction exhibit cusps at their minima. In the case of k_{x}/k =0.8, the total wave force is not larger than that without considering the wave phase. Nevertheless, in the case that k_{x}/k ≤ 0.5, the total wave force is not less than that without considering the wave phase.
Figures 7 and 8 show the variation of the total horizontal wave forces on a vertical circular cylinder and on the composite bucket foundation versus water depth for different ka_{0} and k_{x}/k values with θ_{0} = 0, respectively. From Fig. 7, it can be seen that the maximum wave force on a circular cylinder increases with the increase in the water depth when ka_{0}, k_{x}/k, and θ_{0} are constants. However, the maximum wave force on the composite bucket foundation may first increase and then decrease with the increase in the water depth.
B. Cnoidal wave
Figure 9 shows the dimensional run-up η/H of cnoidal waves on the composite bucket foundation against variable θ/π for different λ and ka_{0} values in the case of t =0 and d =6 m. Figure 10 shows the maximum run-up of cnoidal waves around the composite bucket foundation against wave parameter λ for different ka_{0} values. From Fig. 9, it is observed that wave parameters λ and ka_{0} have a significant influence on the wave run-up of the foundation. In Fig. 10, the maximum run-up, which is independent of the values of ka_{0}, increases as λ increases.
Figure 11 illustrates the variation of the total horizontal cnoidal wave force on the composite bucket foundation versus ka_{0} for different λ values with d =6 m. Figure 12 illustrates the variation of the total horizontal cnoidal wave force on the composite bucket foundation versus water depth for different ka_{0} and λ values. In Fig. 11, irrelevant to the values of ka_{0}, the wave force reaches a maximum at a low frequency, and then, it decreases gradually. From Fig. 12, it is observed that the maximum cnoidal wave force on the composite bucket foundation increases with the increase in the water depth when ka_{0} and λ are constants.
Figure 13 shows the total cnoidal wave force and the Airy wave force on the composite bucket foundation versus kd with different d values for different ratios H/d. It is observed that the wave force on the composite bucket foundation induced by the cnoidal wave is much larger than that induced by the Airy wave. One can therefore conclude that the wave force on the composite bucket foundation computed by cnoidal wave theory is more reliable than that computed by small amplitude wave theory in shallow water conditions.
C. Solitary wave
Figure 14 shows the dimensional run-up η/H of solitary waves on the composite bucket foundation against variable t_{0} at different locations for different λ values in the case of d =6 m. Figure 15 shows the maximum run-up of solitary waves around the composite bucket foundation against χ for different water depths. From Fig. 14, it is observed that parameter χ has a significant influence on the wave run-up of the foundation. In Fig. 15, independent of the values of water depths, the maximum run-up increases at first and then decreases as χ increases. It is also observed that the maximum run-up decreases with the increase in the water depth for a small χ. Besides, the maximum run-up may increase with the increase in the water depth when χ becomes large.
Figure 16 illustrates the temporal variation of the x-component wave force on the composite bucket foundation for different χ values with d =12 m. It can be seen that the maximum wave force and the corresponding time are significantly influenced by χ. For different water depths, the maximum wave force on the composite bucket foundation and the corresponding time t_{0} versus χ are shown in Fig. 17. Apparently, the maximum wave force increases at first and then slightly decreases as χ increases. The maximum wave force also increases with the increase in the water depth. Moreover, the maximum wave force occurs at positive time when χ is small, and it occurs at negative time when χ is large.
Figure 18 shows the maximum wave force against ka_{0} on the composite bucket foundation induced by the solitary wave or the cnoidal wave with different values in the case of d =6 m. It can be seen that the wave force on cylinders induced by the solitary wave is much larger than that induced by the cnoidal wave when the value of χ is large. Therefore, in the design of the composite bucket foundation in shallow water conditions, engineers should determine the wave load by considering both the solitary wave and the cnoidal wave.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
The diffraction of the short-crested wave, cnoidal wave, and solitary wave around a composite bucket foundation is investigated analytically in this study. The free surface elevation and the wave forces are determined. Based on the results presented, the following conclusions can be drawn:
(1) The short-crested wave run-up distribution on the composite bucket foundation is quite different from that of a plane incident wave. The wave phase has a significant effect on the short-crested wave run-up and the short-crested wave force. Moreover, the maximum wave force on the composite bucket foundation may not necessarily occur in the case of the maximum water depth.
(2) Since the maximum wave load is achieved when the incident waves are plane waves, the composite bucket foundation will be safe if the formula derived from the plane waves is used as the design criteria to estimate the wave loading in a short-crested sea.
(3) The wave parameter λ has a significant influence on the cnoidal wave run-up and the wave force on the composite bucket foundation. The cnoidal wave force on the composite bucket foundation increases with the increase in the water depth.
(4) The wave parameter χ has a significant influence on the solitary wave run-up and the wave force on the composite bucket foundation. The solitary wave force on the composite bucket foundation increases with the increase in the water depth.
(5) The wave load should be determined from both the solitary wave and the cnoidal wave in the design of composite bucket foundation in shallow water.
