Spectral calibration of EBT3 and HD-V2 radiochromic film response at high dose using 20 MeV proton beams
Radiochromic film is used extensively in many medical, industrial, and scientific applications. In particular, the film is used in analysis of proton generation and in high intensity laser-plasma experiments where very high dose levels can be obtained. The present study reports calibration of the dose response of Gafchromic EBT3 and HD-V2 radiochromic films up to high exposure densities. A 2D scanning confocal densitometer system is employed to carry out accurate optical density measurements up to optical density 5 on the exposed films at the peak spectral absorption wavelengths. Various wavelengths from 400 to 740 nm are also scanned to extend the practical dose range of such films by measuring the response at wavelengths removed from the peak response wavelengths. Calibration curves for the optical density versus exposure dose are determined and can be used for quantitative evaluation of measured doses based on the measured optical densities. It was found that blue and UV wavelengths allowed the largest dynamic range though at some trade-off with overall accuracy.
I. INTRODUCTION
Radiochromic film (RCF) is used extensively to measure radiation dose in many medical [1,2], industrial [3,4], and scientific [5–9] applications. However, the characteristics of the film change with the introduction of new types of radiochromic film by manufacturers. Calibrations of these new film types are required in order to apply these films for quantitative dose calculations. Updated versions, EBT3 and HD-V2, of Gafchromic films (Ashland, Bridgewater, NJ, USA) have been introduced recently [10]. There have already been several reports on calibrations of these films using gamma ray [11,12], proton [6,13,14], and ion beam sources [15]. However, in some cases, particularly for proton measurements from high intensity laser experiments, the single shot dose on the film can exceed kGy exposures [5–9] and approach the maximum measurable density of typical scanner systems used to read out the optical densities [7]. In order to carry out calibrations which go to the maximum optical densities of such films, it is important to have a high quality scanning system that has an adequate linear optical density range and minimum scattered light. Alternatively, one can scan the film in spectral regions away from the peak density response of the film, allowing measurements over a larger dose range at lower optical densities. Such a strategy has been demonstrated in previous reports where multi-color analysis has been employed for high dose irradiation in Refs [7],  [14], and  [16]. This has been extended into the UV scanning range in Ref [17] where additional dynamic range was obtained for HD810, a previous version of radiochromic film.
In the present study, we have characterized the response of EBT3 and HD-V2 radiochromic films over a large dose range up to an optical density measurement limit of over OD 5. We have constructed a confocal 2D optical densitometer scanning system to carry out scans of irradiated RCF with high fidelity up to optical densities approaching OD 5. The system has interchangeable LED light sources of different wavelengths to allow for measurements at different wavelengths from the UV to the infrared part of the spectrum. The test samples were irradiated with energetic protons from the TR24 cyclotron located at the Medical Isotope and Cyclotron Facility (MICF, University of Alberta). The beam fluence and energy, thus RCF dose, was cross-calibrated using activation measurements of copper monitor foils placed behind the RCF. Least-squares fits to the response curves have been obtained allowing the application of the results in determination of proton doses in experiments using RCF.
II. CONFOCAL SCANNING OPTICAL DENSITOMETER SYSTEM
A schematic diagram of the scanning system is shown in Fig. 1. The scanning spot on the sample is defined by imaging a 500 μm diameter source aperture onto the film sample. The transmitted light is then re-imaged through a second 1000 μm diameter detection aperture to screen against scattered light from optical components in the system. The final optical signal was then focussed onto a 2.5 mm diameter photodiode detector. All imaging was carried out using 25 mm diameter, 50 mm focal length uncoated UV fused silica bi-convex lenses in 1:1 imaging mode.
An aperture on the first lens controlled the effective f-number of the light source while the collection aperture was defined by the 25 mm diameter aperture of the third and fourth lenses. Normally the first aperture was set to approximately 12 mm in diameter for an effective illumination aperture of f/8.3. The effective collection aperture was approximately f/4. The detector was a low noise UV sensitive silicon PIN photodiode with a UV quartz window (EG&G FND-100Q). The measured spatial resolution of the optical system when in scanning mode was measured to be of the order of 300 μm (10%–90% edge resolution).
Various LED light sources could be used to scan the sample film at different wavelengths. Characteristics of the LED sources used here are listed in Table I. The LED output was modulated with a continuous square wave to be able to separate the signal from any residual background light or electrical offset signals. A pulsed driving circuit was used to deliver a 200 Hz square wave current drive signal to the LEDs with a 50% duty cycle. The optical beam passed through four biconvex UV lenses, an adjustable aperture, a set of optical filters (as required), two pinholes and finally focused onto the PIN photodiode. All the optics were set up on a stable optical track which allowed easy refocusing of the imaging system when changing wavelengths. To limit the spectra of the LED to a full width half maximum (FWHM) of approximately 10 nm, an optical bandpass filter was installed in the filter holder for all the scans of any given wavelength. The presence of the bandpass filter and optical filters was taken into account when refocusing the optical system before any set of measurements.
The LEDs used were unpolarized and none of the optical components should introduce or be sensitive to the polarization of the light beam. EBT3 has an active internal layer and the outer substrates are identical but cross-laminated [14] in order to reduce polarization sensitivity. However, it has still been found to be sensitive to polarization [18,19]. The asymmetric HD-V2 films are also sensitive to the polarization of the scanning light source [20]. Two EBT3 and two HD-V2 samples were scanned twice with different orientations yielding OD differences of less than 0.02 indicating the lack of polarization sensitivity in our measurements. Since EBT3 has symmetric substrates, it does not matter which side is facing the light beam during scans. HD-V2 has a single substrate and is consistently scanned with the matte side (active layer side), rather than the smooth (substrate) side, facing the light beam.
The RCF is mounted on an xyz stage with the transverse x and y directions controlled by a LabVIEW program via computer controlled actuators. The manually controlled positioning stage in the z direction adjusts the focus of the optical beam on the RCF sample. The photodiode (200-1150 nm wavelength sensitivity) was reverse biased at 73 V. A low noise 3-stage amplifier circuit was used to amplify the weak signals. The circuit was housed in a metal box and all external coaxial connections were wrapped with a second shielding layer of conductive aluminum tape. The 1st stage is a transimpedance amplifier with 30 MΩ of gain. The second stage consists of a 2nd order low-pass filter with a cut-off frequency of 35.4 kHz and a buffer amplifier with unity gain to couple to the 3rd stage without significant signal attenuation. The 3rd stage is an instrumentation amplifier with a fixed gain of 100. It is connected to a battery-generated offset voltage which improves dynamic range by eliminating the significant offset voltage generated by the leakage current of the photodiode. During scans, the entire setup of the RCF scanner is separated into three chambers, covered in black cardboard, divided by walls located at each of the optical apertures to eliminate stray light. The LED current signal along with both the unity gain (2nd stage) and 100 times gain (3rd stage) outputs of the photodiode amplifier is connected to three analog input channels of a multichannel 14-bit NI USB-6001 DAQ for data collection. Recording both the second stage and third stage output signals simultaneously allowed an extension of the dynamic range without having to preselect the amplifier gain.
The optical densities measured by the scanner are measured relative to that of air (i.e., no RCF samples). The ADC of the DAQ has a sampling frequency of 20 kHz. An adjustable scanning speed is employed allowing much more rapid scanning of film regions at lower optical densities and slower scans in regions of higher optical density. A real-time assessment of the optical density is made with 100 ADC samples (requiring 5 ms), which is then used to control the next measurement period. For large signals (OD 0–3.2), the photodiode voltage reading at each pixel requires 1000 ADC samples, taking 50 ms to collect. The LED current signal is measured intermittently with 1000 ADC samples collected once every 10 photodiode voltage readings. A small signal algorithm was employed to increase the number of samples for weak signals above OD 3.2. For signals with optical densities between OD 3.2 and OD 4.2, 1000 ADC samples were simultaneously collected for both the LED current and photodiode signals. For very small signals with OD greater than 4.2, 2000 ADC samples were simultaneously collected for both the LED and photodiode signals. The average values of the high and low states of the square wave signals were determined for the photodiode signal and the LED current signal, taking care to remove transient artifacts at the rising and falling edges of the signals. As such, the signal processing was similar to a lock-in amplifier for detection of the 200 Hz modulated waveforms. The present scanning system is capable of scanning exposed films with OD less than 4.2 at a rate of 21 cm^{2}/h with a step resolution of 400 μm in the horizontal and vertical directions. Measurements below OD 3.2 are made at a rate of 250 ms per pixel and from OD 3.2 to OD 4.2 at a rate of 300 ms per pixel. For OD above 4.2, the measurement time at each pixel position of the scan is increased to 400 ms to give accurate values in this high optical density range. Typically only a small region of the order of 1 cm^{2} in the middle of a film plate exposed to a high intensity proton beam will be at high optical densities and the surrounding regions can be scanned much more quickly. By using this active scan speed control system, typical scan times for such proton beam exposed films 50 mm × 50 mm in size are of the order of 75 min or less with 400 μm resolution.
To test the linearity of the scanner, neutral density (ND) filters were inserted in place of the RCF sample. Different combinations of calibrated ND filters were placed in the filter holder and the resulting OD (relative to air) was measured. As shown in Fig. 2, the system was linear up to optical densities of 5.0 with an error in measured light intensity of less than 3% up to OD 4.3. At a value of OD 5.5, a deviation 1.7% in optical density was observed as shown. At OD 4.9, the optical density was accurate to 0.7% and the light intensity measured by the scanner was accurate to 8%. A least-squares linear fit through the origin (y = mx) up to OD 4.9 gave a slope of m = 0.993. The dynamic range of the densitometer is limited by the incident optical power on the sample and by the noise of the measurement system. With no sample in our densitometer, the incident optical power (∼0.5 μW) corresponds to a 10 V amplifier output. The typical amplifier output noise level is ∼18 μV RMS. The minimum output signal for conversion to optical density is set at 10 μV, so any single pixel measurement has a maximum value of OD = 6. We define the optical density measurement limit OD_{ML} as the optical density at which the measured value of OD is within 2% of its correct value leading to an OD_{ML} value of 5.5 in the present case.
III. FILM EXPOSURE USING 20 MeV PROTON CYCLOTRON SOURCE
A schematic diagram of the RCF proton exposure setup is shown in Fig. 3. The TR24 variable energy cyclotron at the MICF was used to carry out the calibrated exposures of the film. An approximately 1 cm diameter beam of 20 MeV protons (<100 nA) was incident on a copper plate with a 0.5 mm diameter pinhole transmitting about 1/400 of the incident cyclotron proton current (actual transmission assessed by means of copper monitor foils). A 292 μm thick aluminum plate degrades and scatters the transmitted proton beam which drifts about 237 mm through ambient air before reaching the radiochromic film stack in an approximately 10 mm (FWHM) beam spot.
Natural copper plates were placed behind the film stacks in order to monitor the proton energy and current using the nuclear activation reactions ^{nat}Cu(p,x)^{62}Zn and ^{nat}Cu(p,x)^{63}Zn. The activities of ^{62}Zn and ^{63}Zn radioisotopes are measured after the proton bombardment using HPGe high resolution gamma spectroscopy with energy and efficiency calibration achieved using NIST traceable sources of ^{133}Ba, ^{60}Co, ^{57}Co, ^{54}Mn, ^{22}Na, ^{109}Cd, and ^{137}Cs.
The reaction probability P_{α} for production of a ^{α}Zn nucleus by a proton travelling a distance L through copper is given by
where E_{0} and E_{L} are the initial and final proton energies, ρ is the copper mass density, m is the isotope averaged mass of a natural copper atom, ρ/m is the copper number density, σ_{α}(E) is the reaction cross section for production of ^{α}Zn, and S_{Cu}(E) = −dE/ρdx is the stopping power of copper. For the cyclotron energies used in this work, the proton stops (E_{L} = 0) in the final 812 μm thick copper plate.
The activity A(t_{B}) of the radioisotope generated after a bombardment time t_{B} by a constant proton current I starting at t = 0 is given by
where q is the proton charge and λ is the decay constant [21]. After the end of bombardment (t > t_{B}), the gamma count C accumulated during a time T starting at t_{C} is given by
where η is the detector efficiency, Γ is the gamma decay intensity, and T_{L} is the detector live time. Substitute Eq. (2) into Eq. (3) and integrate, to solve for the incident proton current I,
The total incident proton charge at the copper foil is then given by Q = It_{B}. The same proton charge flows through the RCF stack. The dose profile in the film can be calculated, given the proton spatial profile and the RCF active layer proton stopping power. The proton spatial charge density profile is assumed to be of the form QF(r) where F(r) is a double Gaussian distribution or the Gauss Rutherford distribution [22] and is normalized by requiring ∬FdA = 1 where the integration is over the proton exposed area of the RCF. The deposited dose in the RCF is given by D(r) = S_{R}QF(r)/q (J/kg) where S_{R} (J m^{2} kg^{−1}) is the stopping power of the RCF active layer. With S_{R} expressed in MeV cm^{2} g^{−1}, Q in Coulomb, and F(r) in cm^{−2}, the dose can be determined as
The peak dose at r = 0 is given by
The parameters of the distribution function F(r) are determined by 2D fits to the optical density arrays using an iterative process, described in Sec. IV. The best estimate of the distribution function peak at r = 0 is
The proton energies incident at all layers of the stack are calculated as a function of cyclotron proton energy using the continuous slow down approximation (CSDA) with the stopping powers from the NIST PSTAR data base [26]. Layer materials, thicknesses, and incident proton energies for a typical 20.3 MeV cyclotron energy are listed in Table II. According to the manufacturer, the active layers of the RCF have stopping power similar to tissue [10]. Therefore NIST PSTAR data for A150 tissue equivalent plastic are used to approximate the film active layer stopping power. The reaction probabilities in the copper layer(s) as a function of cyclotron proton energy are calculated using the CSDA and the IAEA recommended ^{nat}Cu proton activation cross sections [27] in Eq. (1). When both radioisotopes (^{62}Zn and ^{63}Zn) occur in sufficient quantity, the ratio of activation probabilities
was used to estimate the incident proton energy at the copper layer [21], and then CSDA calculations are used to estimate energies incident at the RC film active layers, and the cyclotron energy. The calculated incident energies, RCF active layer stopping powers, and copper activation probabilities as functions of cyclotron energy are listed in Table III. Using the activation probability ratios, the average cyclotron proton energy is estimated to be 20.3 ± 0.3 MeV, in good agreement with the nominal extracted 20 MeV energy. For the higher dose cases, the activation of 25 μm thick Cu plates was measured, and for lower doses, the 812 μm plates were used. For the 812 μm plates, only one measurement of activation probability ratio was obtained, corresponding to a cyclotron energy of 20.4 MeV. This same activation ratio (and cyclotron energy) was assumed for the other 812 μm thick Cu plates. The actual average energy of protons when passing through the RCF was 18.0 ± 0.3 MeV for the HD-V2 and 17.2 ± 0.3 MeV in the EBT3 film. Thus, our measurements represent the response of the RCF to 17–18 MeV protons incident on the film. It is estimated that the peak dose estimates in the RCF active layers are accurate to the order of 10% on average with larger error bars at lower doses. When fitting the spatial distribution of the dose profile, there are additional errors in the fitting functions used as discussed below. Tests were carried out to ensure that secondary radiation from the copper layers did not cause any significant additional exposure of the RCF samples. In all cases, the uncertainty in the incident proton charge is estimated to be less than ±6% (one standard deviation). Major error sources include gamma counting statistics and peak fitting error, HPGe detector efficiency uncertainty, and reaction cross section uncertainty.
IV. RCF SAMPLE MEASUREMENTS
The RCF samples were irradiated at the cyclotron facility at several dose levels from 2.3 Gy to 25 kGy. In most cases, a stack of two RCF samples was irradiated during one exposure. After exposure, the films were scanned with the densitometer to record 2D optical density arrays. At wavelengths where the RCF optical density does not exceed the OD_{ML}, our data show that at high values of dose, as the dose increases, the film OD reaches a maximum value (saturation), then slowly decreases with additional dose (solarization).
The proton irradiation spot used was initially assumed to be approximately double Gaussian in profile due to the scattering from the aluminum plate employed at the entrance pinhole to the RCF proton exposure assembly. However, a more accurate fit of the calculated OD profile to the measured optical density profile was obtained using the Gauss-Rutherford proton distribution function suggested by Bellinzona et_al [22],
where
where x and y are the spatial coordinates, x_{0} and y_{0} are the coordinates of the most highly exposed center, and N, W, σ, c, x_{0}, y_{0} are the fitting parameters.
We used an iterative process to estimate the peak of the normalized proton distribution function F_{GR}(0). Initially we employed the manufacturer’s suggested model for the dependence of optical density on dose given by
where a, b > 0 are the fitting parameters, D = dose, and OD_{0} is the optical density of unexposed RCF. However, we obtained better fits using the second order rational function
where a_{1}, a_{2}, b_{0}, b_{1} > 0 are the fitting parameters, D = dose (Gy), and OD_{0} is the optical density of unexposed RCF. This function allows for a possible supralinear fit (g″(D) > 0) at low doses and approaches the limit a_{2} at high dose. To start the fitting procedure, the proton distribution was assumed proportional to a double Gaussian F_{DG}(r), and f(D) [Eq. (11)] was fit to the OD (x, y)–OD_{0} arrays, with the prefactors in Eq. (5) incorporated in the fit parameter b, and with a, b and the parameters of F_{DG}(r) freely varied. The best fit at 676 nm for an HD-V2 sample with a peak dose of ∼300 Gy was normalized and used to calculate a preliminary F_{DG}(0) = 0.79 cm^{−2}. Using F_{DG}(0), the peak dose D(0) for all the RCF samples was then estimated using Eq. (6). Next, g(D) was fit to plots of ODpk–OD_{0} vs. D(0) to determine the first estimates of the g(D) coefficients a1,a2,b0,b1λ{set1} at wavelengths 634, 676, and 738 nm for EBT3 and HD-V2. Then with the Gauss Rutherford distribution F_{GR}(r) in Eq. (5), the g(D) coefficients fixed at a1,a2,b0,b1λ{set1} and Eq. (5) prefactors included in N, the parameters of F_{GR}(r) were varied to fit g(D) to the OD(x, y) − OD_{0} arrays at 634, 676, and 738 nm for EBT3 and HD-V2. Only arrays with D(0) included in the first g(D) fit were used for fitting F_{GR}(r). The average value F_{GR}(0)_{av} = 0.734 cm^{−2} is then used in Eq. (6) to determine the peak dose values presented in Table IV. To obtain the normalized distribution functions (∬FdA=1), the raw un-normalized 2D fit function [e.g., right side of Eq. (9)] is summed over the number of exposed points (excluding the unexposed corners) and multiplied by the area element (0.005 × 0.005 cm^{−2}). The raw 2D fit function was divided by this sum to obtain the normalized distribution F(r). Rather than least-squares regression, Matlab robust regression was used so that deviant points due to noise would be weighted less in the fits. The ranges of the fitting parameters W, σ, c for the cleanest fits were applied to all other fits. These corresponded to ranges of 0.22–0.30 (dimensionless) for W, 4.2–4.4 mm for σ, and 70–90 mm^{2} for c. All the fits are constrained within these ranges of W, σ, and c, causing the distribution peak F(0) to vary by up to 4%, due to the normalization requirement. The average values of the fit parameters are W_{av} = 0.2722, σ_{av} = 4.303 mm, and c_{av} = 87.4 mm^{2}, giving a proton beam spot of 10.46 mm FWHM. Typical spatial profiles of measured samples are shown in Fig. 4.
The fractional fitting error in OD values for the 2D fits, calculated using the formula fractional fit error = 1n∑i=1nODdata(i)−ODfit(i)ODdata(i){2}, was found to be less than 3% for all the fits. The average fractional fitting error is 1.8% for HD-V2 and 1.1% for EBT3.
RCF samples with spots exposed by the proton beam were scanned in 2D with a spatial resolution of 400 μm at 3 peak wavelengths: 634 nm, 676 nm, and 738 nm. In addition, the center region of the RCF samples was scanned for 402 nm and 468 nm. The optical density at peak dose OD_{pk} is defined as the average OD of the most highly exposed point at x_{0}, y_{0} and the 8 nearest neighbor points. Since the thick aluminum ring used to mount the RCF also masks the film corners, the average OD of the unexposed corners was used to calculate OD_{0}. The values of OD_{pk} − OD_{0} at different wavelength and peak dose are listed in Table IV. Robust non-linear regression in MATLAB was used to fit g(D) to the data of Table IV and the final values of the coefficients a1,a2,b0,b1λ{set2} are listed in Table V. The function g(D) does not fit well near film saturation; therefore, some high dose points were excluded from the fits as indicated in Table IV. The data and corresponding fit curves are plotted in Figs. 5 and 6. We note that the EBT3 fits at 676 and 738 nm initially have g^{″}0=2(a_{2}b_{0}−a_{1}b_{1})/b02>0 and maintain positive curvature up to inflection points at 12.6 and 20.9 Gy, respectively. This indicates a supralinear low dose response, as has been reported elsewhere for a previous radiochromic film type MD-55 [23–25]. By assuming F_{GR}(r) in Eq. (5) and the D(0) values from Table IV, and using average radial profiles from the OD arrays, we can plot the dose response OD(r) − OD_{0} vs. D(r) spanning an interval to nearby lower D(0) points, as shown in Fig. 7. The good agreement between adjacent profiles indicates that the Gauss-Rutherford distribution is a reasonable approximation to the actual dose profile. In addition, this method estimates the response at high dose in cases where the OD_{pk} − OD_{0} values are excluded from the curve fit.
The peak-exposed center spots of the RCF samples were also scanned by a spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer Lambda 900) from 400 nm to 850 nm. A 3.5 mm diameter aperture was placed on the RCF film for these spectrophotometer scans to restrict the measurement area to the peak exposed area. A small correction of the order of 2.3% was applied to the measured OD to scale to the peak OD to take into account the small spatial variation in OD over this measurement spot. This was based on the average irradiation beam profile parameters given above. The resulting spectra for EBT3 are shown in Fig. 8 and for HD-V2 are shown in Fig. 9. By scanning a narrow band HeNe optical interference filter and a samarium glass absorption filter, the spectrophotometer was found to be accurate to 1.0 nm in wavelength. For exposed HD-V2 films, the peak absorption wavelengths shift to slightly shorter wavelengths with increasing dose. This may cause the change in slope of the 676 nm response at around 200 Gy, as seen in Fig. 7(b).
The measured absorption spectra for EBT3 after subtracting background unexposed optical density (OD_{0}) are compared to those of León-Marroquín et_al [12] in Fig. 10. There is reasonable agreement within approximately 10% in the optical densities in the range of 8 Gy–50 Gy dose levels. However, some differences in spectral features can be seen. This might indicate differences in both final chemical composition and differences due to different aging of the EBT3 films. León-Marroquín et_al [12] have discussed the fact that there are several individual absorption peaks contributing to the main peaks observed in the absorption spectrum and that there are spectral shifts of these peaks as a function of dose. For the HD-V2 film, a comparison of our results with those of Albogamy [11] is shown in Fig. 11. Again, the background exposure has been subtracted out to show the increase in OD induced by the radiation dose. Over most of the spectral range, our results agree with Albogamy’s spectra within approximately 20% over the dose range of 50 Gy–500 Gy. The larger discrepancy for the peak at around 670 nm in Albogamy’s spectra for the 500 Gy exposure could be due to the film density exceeding the linear range of the spectrophotometer system in their case and thus we ignore this spectral peak in our comparison. It has been reported [28] that the OD of Gafchromic EBT and EBT2 can vary by plus or minus 20% from batch to batch due to changes in chemical composition between batches made by the manufacturer. In addition, Lillo et_al [29] reported that Gafchromic XR-QA2 films can have batch-to-batch variations of up to 55%. Thus, the 20% discrepancy between our HD-V2 film results and Albogamy’s measurements is comparable to previously reported variations.
The results measured using our confocal scanner system have also been compared to the results from the spectrophotometer measurements. To make this comparison, the equivalent response for each spectral channel “k” was calculated using the effective spectral source strength versus wavelength [source_{k}(λ_{i})], equal to the product of the bandpass filter spectrum k, the LED source spectrum k, and the Si photodiode responsivity. The equivalent OD_{k} was then calculated using the formula
where RCF T(λ_{i}) represents the measured spectral transmittance of RCF at wavelength λ_{i}. Comparisons were only made up to optical densities of approximately 3.4 as measured within the dynamic range of the spectrophotometer. The calculated ratios are plotted in Fig. 12 for EBT3 film and HD-V2 film. While scatter in the individual ratios is observed, the average value of all the ratios shown is 1.02 ± 0.01 giving an average residual error between the spectrophotometer readings and the scanner readings of 2%. The average RMS scatter in the set of all calculated ratios from the expected value of 1.00 is 0.075. This scatter is reasonable given the numerous spectral and spatial response functions that are convolved into each comparison ratio.
When using a spectrophotometer to read out the film exposures at the absorption peaks of 634 and 676 nm, the maximum density range of the spectrophotometer of 3.4 limits the range of exposure values that can be measured by over an order of magnitude compared to the scanner system which can measure densities up to 5. By using wavelengths in the UV and infrared wavelength ranges, one can further extend the measurable dose range to 25 kGy for HD-V2 and to 50 Gy in the UV region and 700 Gy in the IR region for EBT3, as seen in Figs. 8 and 9.
V. DISCUSSION
Response curves for EBT3 and HD-V2 versus dose have been measured at a number of fixed wavelengths in the blue, red, and near infrared wavelength range up to optical densities of the order of OD 5. The errors in these response curves arise from measurement errors in optical density and errors in calculating the dose exposure for each measurement. The estimated error in the OD measurements was on the order of a few percent for values of OD less than 5. The larger error was in the estimated dose for each exposure. For these measurements, the cyclotron was operated at very low proton currents in order to obtain exposures in the desired dose range. The proton beam current after the 0.5 mm pinhole was in the range 10–600 pA and could not be directly measured in the presence of a significant offset current due to secondary emission from the copper pinhole disc. Therefore, the activation of copper witness samples was used to determine the proton dose. The published values of the activation cross sections employed are estimated to be accurate to the order of a few percent. Iterative fits of the resultant dose response curves and fitting the spatial beam profiles allowed a spatial integration of the beam profile to give the peak dose at the center of each exposed RCF. Based on the range that fitting variables could be varied and still obtain a reasonable fit to the data, the error in estimated dose due to uncertainty of the spatial distribution is estimated to be 10%. These errors are larger than the measurement errors in actual optical density values. The activation and spatial distribution uncertainties are the major contributors to the final uncertainty in the RCF dose of approximately 14%.
From the measured results, it is clear that useful exposure data can be obtained at the standard peak measurement wavelengths of 634 nm and 676 nm for these films at optical densities up to OD 5. In addition, it is also feasible to measure the optical density at alternative wavelengths in the UV or infrared part of the spectrum where the optical density response is much less for a given dose. At these wavelengths, measurements up to OD 3 allow extension of the dose measurement range by at least an order of magnitude beyond what could be measured at the peak absorption wavelengths. It was found that at high dose, discoloration of the films was evident indicating possible saturation and solarization effects and conversion of the initial absorption species into new chemical species. The saturation of optical density values was apparent at high doses for infrared wavelengths, while larger dose values could be measured at 402 nm which seemed less sensitive to the onset of saturation. A dose in HD-V2 up to 25 kGy could be measured in the blue response channels (402, 468 nm) without evident saturation (Figs. 6 and 9), while the 676 nm channel is saturating and the 738 nm channel is approaching saturation as can be seen in Figs. 6, 7(b), and 9, where there are only small changes in optical density from a dose of 11.9 kGy–24.7 kGy. The extension in useful readout range observed here in the blue channels is similar to that reported by Scott et_al [17] where a range beyond 100 kGy was obtained by scanning at wavelengths of 320 nm for HD810, a previous version of the RCF similar to the HD-V2. For EBT3, the onset of saturation appears in the 738 nm channel at a dose of 783 Gy (Fig. 5) with no additional increase in optical density for a dose of 5.53 kGy, as can be seen in Figs. 7(a) and 8. The saturation and solarization of EBT3 at 738 nm can be clearly seen in the 2D scan of the EBT3 film exposed at the peak dose of 5.53 kGy (Fig. 13), where the OD reaches a maximum value (saturates) in the shoulder of the exposed region at a dose less than 5.53 kGy and then drops (solarizes) as the exposure increases to 5.53 kGy. For EBT3 at 402 nm, we do not see clear evidence of saturation at 783 Gy (Fig. 5). However, additional OD measurements in the blue at higher dose are needed to verify that the useful dose measurement range of EBT3 can be significantly extended by using blue wavelengths.
When scanning at UV and infrared wavelengths, two factors must be taken into account. The first is that the relative change in the OD versus dose is smaller at these wavelengths and thus the dose measurements at these wavelengths have increased sensitivity to small changes in the background optical density and to any measurement errors in optical density. However, this is often an acceptable trade-off in order to have a larger measurement dynamic range. The second factor is that at UV wavelengths, it is known that the film can be exposed by the UV radiation itself [30]. Thus small shifts in the background optical density could occur as the film is being read out. However, from our tests it appears that the changes induced by scanning at blue wavelengths are small, less than the order of 0.05 OD for a single scan at 402 nm and thus would be acceptable for high dose readout applications.
There are other issues related to using RCF for absolute dose measurements. It is known that the optical densities increase with time for a period of several hours after exposure [1,10,31,32]. It has been reported that after the first 24 h period, the exposure of the film remains constant within ±4% for the period of at least 6 months [31]. In our case, the samples were analyzed at times well after the exposure over a period of 20–40 weeks after exposure. In addition, a few samples were scanned again at a time of 7 months after the initial scans and the change in OD was found to be within 0.03 whereas the background OD also increased by 0.02. Thus, the net change above background was only of the order of OD 0.01. Another important question is the potential variation of the film sensitivity due to changes in manufacturing procedures over time. Batch-to-batch variations up to 20% are reported in the literature for EBT and EBT2 films [28] and up to 55% for other radiochromic films [29] which are possibly due to some variations in composition. A study of a large sample set of different batches of film would be required to determine an accurate value of the standard deviation from batch to batch of the film. It appears that accurate dose measurements would require calibration of the given batch of the film used in a given experiment. Finally, the effects of aging and change in sensitivity versus shelf life should be assessed in more detail. Simple subtraction of background optical density for unexposed films at a given wavelength appears to give an adequate first order correction for the cumulative exposure and aging of the film as it sits unused for periods of time. However, in the full spectral scans measured here, small differences in spectral features can be seen compared to other published results and compared to the manufacturer’s published response curves. Some of these may be related to variations in films from batch to batch, while some may be related to small chemical changes occurring in the film over time which may lead to changes in the dose response function. Again, the overall agreement of our measured results with previously published results indicates that these effects are not very large.
In many cases, commercial flat bed scanning systems have been used to scan the exposed RCF samples [5,6,14,16,18]. In those cases, the actual scanning source spectrum is either white light or a very broad color band. It is very difficult to quantitatively compare the measurements presented here with those published results without knowing in detail the characteristics of the light sources and spectral response functions of all stages of the scanner measurement. In general, quantitative measurements with such scanner systems require calibration with film specimens that have been exposed to known radiation doses. Because of the broadband light sources used in such scanners, they do capture some of the advantages of scanning at wavelengths off the peak response wavelengths since light in these off peak spectral regions will still be transmitted at attenuated levels even for larger exposures and thus the response curves tend to have a more gentle roll off of measured optical densities with dose than measurements at the peak absorption wavelengths. However, such scanners are still limited in the maximum optical densities which can be measured reliably up to OD values of approximately 2–3 depending on the scanner system.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, a high dynamic range 2D optical scanning system has been built for 2D scanning of radiochromic film up to high optical densities for applications such as high intensity laser production of intense MeV energy protons beams. The scanning range achieved is up to OD 5.4 with a linearity and accuracy in OD of the order of 1% up to the linear measurement limit, OD_{ML} of 5, for the present system. This system is capable of measuring the optical density profiles at well-defined wavelengths within optical bandwidths of 10 nm using interchangeable LED light sources and bandpass filters. The measured spatial resolution was of the order of 300 μm for 10% to 90% slope edges. By using an active scan speed control system, typical scan times for proton beam exposed films, 50 mm × 50 mm in size, are of the order of an hour with 400 μm step sizes. In future work, our OD_{ML} could be increased by using higher optical power and reducing the noise. Optical power can be increased by using lasers instead of LEDs, with the constraint that the laser light should not contribute significantly to the film dose. The noise can be reduced by using a lock-in amplifier, longer averaging time, a smaller area silicon detector and a lower noise photodiode amplifier.
This system was employed to scan RCF samples which had been exposed using a 20 MeV proton cyclotron source with peak dose values up to 25 kGy. The exposed samples were measured using the optical scanner system at a number of wavelengths from the blue to the near IR spectral regions. In addition, complete spectral scans of a number of the exposed films were carried out using a spectrophotometer system, agreeing with the optical scanner results within standard deviation error bars of 8% for ODs up to 3. The spectrophotometer measurements also agreed with similar published measurements for EBT-3 film within approximately 10% and for HD-V2 film within approximately 20%.
It was found that scanning at a blue wavelength of 402 nm gave the largest dynamic ranges up to 700 Gy for EBT3 and both 402 nm and 468 nm gave the largest dynamic ranges up to 25 kGy for HD-V2. It is possible that higher values could also be read out at these wavelengths, as indicated up to and beyond 100 kGy in previous studies [17], but no exposures were carried out at higher doses in the present study. It was also found that while the optical densities measured at 738 nm also increased more slowly with dose, potentially allowing measurements to higher doses at moderate optical density (e.g., OD_{ML} ∼ 2.5), that the response at 738 nm begins to saturate at dose levels of the order of 500 Gy and 15 kGy for EBT3 and HD-V2, respectively.
The present results now allow analysis and studies of RCF exposure up to doses of approximately 25 kGy. Such single-shot high-dose fluences are readily generated by current generation Petawatt class laser sources and the results indicate that by choosing appropriate readout wavelengths, GAF radiochromic films can effectively be used in characterizing proton generation at such high dose levels.

FIG. 3. 
The RCF proton exposure assembly is shown schematically. A 25 μm thick aluminum foil is used to isolate the cyclotron vacuum. A copper disc with 0.5 mm diameter pinhole was used to reduce the cyclotron beam current, and a 292 μm thick aluminum disc was used to scatter the proton beam. Typical proton energies incident at the layers are as indicated for an extracted 20.3 MeV proton energy. Radioactivation of the 26 μm and 812 μm Cu plates was used to estimate the RCF doses. The materials and thickness of all the layers are listed in Table II.

The red points represent rejected corner points and points that deviate too far from the fit. Dust particles can cause some points to be too deviant during a scan.

Measured OD–OD_{0} versus dose for the EBT3 film at various scan wavelengths (Table IV) and fit curves g(D) using coefficients of Table V. The solid lines indicate the measured range and dashed lines are extrapolated using the fitted curve. The peak absorption wavelength is 634 nm at low doses but the UV and infrared wavelengths with lower absorption allow measurement up to higher exposure doses. The red point has been excluded from the 738 nm fit due to the onset of saturation of the film response in the IR range.

Measured OD–OD_{0} versus dose for the HD-V2 film (Table IV) at various scan wavelengths and fit curves g(D) using coefficients of Table V. The solid lines indicate the fit range and dashed lines are extrapolated using the fitted curve. The peak absorption wavelength is 676 nm at low doses but there is a crossover near 5000 Gy where the density measured at 634 nm exceeds that measured at 676 nm. The red points have been excluded from the 676 and 738 nm fits due to the onset of saturation of the film response at these wavelengths.

Each profile spans a range from D(0) to D(r) = D(0)/30. Three colors distinguish individual curves from different film exposures.
