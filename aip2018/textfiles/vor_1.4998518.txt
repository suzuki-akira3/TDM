Production and aging of paramagnetic point defects in P-doped floating zone silicon irradiated with high fluence 27 MeV electrons
Enhancing the long term stable performance of silicon detectors used for monitoring the position and flux of the particle beams in high energy physics experiments requires a better knowledge of the nature, stability, and transformation properties of the radiation defects created over the operation time. We report the results of an electron spin resonance investigation in the nature, transformation, and long term stability of the irradiation paramagnetic point defects (IPPDs) produced by high fluence (2 × 10^{16} cm^{−2}), high energy (27 MeV) electrons in n-type, P-doped standard floating zone silicon. We found out that both freshly irradiated and aged (i.e., stored after irradiation for 3.5 years at 250 K) samples mainly contain negatively charged tetravacancy and pentavacancy defects in the first case and tetravacancy defects in the second one. The fact that such small cluster vacancy defects have not been observed by irradiation with low energy (below 5 MeV) electrons, but were abundantly produced by irradiation with neutrons, strongly suggests the presence of the same mechanism of direct formation of small vacancy clusters by irradiation with neutrons and high energy, high fluence electrons, in agreement with theoretical predictions. Differences in the nature and annealing properties of the IPPDs observed between the 27 MeV electrons freshly irradiated, and irradiated and aged samples were attributed to the presence of a high concentration of divacancies in the freshly irradiated samples, defects which transform during storage at 250 K through diffusion and recombination processes.
I. INTRODUCTION
The use of crystalline silicon in pixel and microstrip detectors for particle tracking at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) from the European Nuclear Research Center CERN and its planned High Luminosity upgrade (HL-LHC) requires to further improve its bulk radiation hardness to radiation damage produced by the large intensity of high energy charged hadrons, resulting in the degradation of the detectors performance [1,2]. The radiation induced changes in the properties and structure of the crystalline Si in the tracking detectors are basically due to the formation and interaction of irradiation defects, reflected in changes in the electrical properties, namely: (a) the strong increase in the detector leakage current (LC), (b) the change in the space charge concentration (N_{eff} —effective doping), and (c) the considerable reduction of the Charge Collection Efficiency (CCE) [3]. It is therefore essential to determine the nature, transformation, and stability of the radiation defects produced at high radiation energy and fluence levels, especially of those known to influence directly or indirectly the performances of the Si-based sensors operating at room temperature (RT) [1,3,4]. Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) spectroscopy is one of the best techniques for determining the presence, concentration, and nature/structure of the irradiation paramagnetic point defects (IPPDs) in insulators and semiconductors [5–7]. In the particular case of crystalline silicon, multifrequency and multiresonance ESR techniques [8,9] have been extensively employed to identify and characterize the huge number of intrinsic and radiation induced paramagnetic defects reported so far [10,11]. Since ESR relies on the presence of unpaired electrons, sometimes optical “in-situ” excitation at low temperatures is necessary to generate a metastable charge state with non-zero ground spin state [12,13]. By detecting changes in the concentration of the paramagnetic point defects under isochronal and isothermal annealing, ESR also supplies quantitative information about the thermal induced transformation of the IPPDs, essential in understanding their structural properties, interaction, and transformation mechanisms [8,14,15]. While most of the information about the annealing–transformation properties of the IPPDs in silicon for radiation detectors has been obtained from thermal annealing experiments at temperatures above the usual production (room) temperature (RT), their long term stability around RT, where the detectors are operating, has been less investigated [3,4,15].
Here, we report the results of an ESR study concerning the long term (3.5 years) aging at T = 250 K, of the IPPDs produced by RT irradiation with 27 MeV electrons, at high fluence (2 × 10^{16} cm^{−2}), in n-type high resistivity standard floating-zone silicon (STFZ) samples. It evidences the unexpected transformations of the negatively charged multivacancy type defects observed for the first time in the freshly electron-irradiated silicon into neutral tetravacancies [V_{4}]^{0}, a process which can be partly reversed by annealing at T > 150 °C. To our knowledge, this is the first time that such effects have been reported.
II. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS
A. Samples preparation and irradiation
The investigations were performed on samples cut from a Si wafer of 0.3 mm thick and 100 mm diameter, of oxygen lean standard float-zone (STFZ) single crystalline n-type (P-doped), high resistivity (ρ = 3–4 kΩ cm), with (100) oriented polished surfaces, from Wacker-Chemitronik GmbH. Such Si-wafers are used in the tracking detectors at CERN. Their impurity concentration values, c(O) = 1 × 10^{16} cm^{−3}; c(C) = 2 × 10^{15} cm^{−3}, and c(P) = 1 × 10^{12} cm^{−3}, are in the range of previously reported values (see Table 4.1 from Moll [4]). Platelets of 10 × 10 mm^{2} cut from the STFZ wafer were irradiated at RT with 27 MeV electrons (fluence 2 × 10^{16} cm^{−2}) at the Metrology Institute PTB, Braunschweig, Germany [16].
B. ESR methodology
ESR sample probes of 4 × 1.8 × 0.3 mm^{3}, with the longest side parallel to one of the ⟨110⟩ crystal axes, were cut either from a freshly irradiated platelet and inserted in the sealed bottom of calibrated ultrapure silica tubes of 2 mm inner diameter for Q-band measurements. Similar ESR sample probes were cut 3.5 years later from the remaining platelet, which was kept in between in a freezer at ∼250 K, without any additional annealing treatment. Each ESR sample probe contained about 1.1 × 10^{20} atoms of Si. Between measurements, the samples were also kept in the freezer, at ∼250 K. No changes in the concentration of the observed IPPDs for the samples cut from different parts of the irradiated platelets were observed. The ESR measurements were performed in the Q (34 GHz) microwave frequency band, from RT down to 20 K, with an ELEXSYS-E500Q (Bruker) spectrometer equipped with a high sensitivity probe head and a cryostat operating from 3.6 K up to RT, at a nominal sensitivity of 1.2 × 10^{9} spins/Gauss. Details about the equipment are given in Stefan et_al [17] and Nistor et_al [18]
For in-situ “across the gap” illumination, we employed 1.06 μm coherent light from a thermally stabilized pig tailed laser diode model LPS-1060-FC of 60 mW maximum output power from ThorLabs. The emitted light was directed with minimum loss (<5%) at the investigated sample in the EPR spectrometer microwave cavity, through a 1 mm diameter optical fiber vacuum tight inserted in the sample holder rod, with its lower flat polished end laying a few cm above the top of the investigated sample. Using a goniometer coupled to the upper part of the sample holder rod, one could rotate the sample around its long axis, resulting in the magnetic field rotation in the (110) crystal plane perpendicular to the sample's long axis. The ESR spectra were recorded with the samples rotated in steps of 5° between the ⟨100⟩ and ⟨110⟩ orientations, going through the ⟨111⟩ orientation. The initial, approximate orientation of the sample principal crystal axes with respect to the magnetic field, established by the visual orientation of the (100) facets perpendicular to the magnetic field, was further improved from examining the ESR spectra recorded for rotations of the sample in steps of 1°–2° on both sides of the initial, approximate ⟨100⟩ orientation.
ESR spectra were recorded on sample probes cut from the as-received, freshly irradiated platelet, before and after being subjected to isochronal annealing in steps of 50 °C/30 min, from 150 °C up to 300 °C. In order to find the optimum sensitivity conditions for recording the spectra of the observed IPPDs, we initially performed exploratory ESR measurements at temperatures in the 250–90 K and 70–20 K ranges, at low and high microwave powers. We found weak anisotropic lines in the as-irradiated sample, besides some low intensity isotropic EPR spectra previously attributed to paramagnetic surface and impurity related centers [19]. Their intensity could be, in many cases, increased by in-situ above the gap illumination with 1.06 μm monochromatic light at T < 150 K. An upper 10 mW output power of 1.06 μm in-situ illumination was usually enough to reach the maximum ESR intensity for the presently reported paramagnetic defects. Due to the rather small size of the investigated samples, one could get, even in the optimum conditions of temperature, magnetic field modulation, and microwave power, ESR spectra with signal to noise ratio s/n < 15. For the less intense lines, workable ESR spectra could be obtained only by further tedious multiple field scanning. The increase in the concentration/production of the paramagnetic (ESR active) IPPDs by across the gap illumination seems very likely to be related to changes in the charge state of the IPPDs by trapping the mobile electrons/holes produced by illumination. The enhancement of the ESR signals from the A/[V-O]^{−}, G7/[V_{2}]^{−} and G15/[C_{i} − O_{i}]^{+} centers in both float-zone n-type and crucible grown n- and p-type irradiated Si by illumination with photon energy >0.76 eV has been previously reported and attributed to the optical recharging defects [20,21]. It has been also reported in certain cases of illumination with white light [22].
During the ESR measurements, the irradiated samples were handled at room temperature (RT) for a total of less than 6 weeks, a length of time which did not result in significant changes in the concentration/nature of the observed IPPDs. About 3.5 years later, we decided to reinvestigate the formation of IPPDs on samples cut from the stored, irradiated platelets using ESR. As will be shown here, we found entirely different ESR spectra from new IPPDs resulting, very likely, from the diffusion and interaction with other defects and/or aggregation of the divacancies initially produced by irradiation.
III. RESULTS
A. ESR of the freshly irradiated STFZ samples: Isochronal annealing experiments
Isotropic ESR signals, similar to those reported earlier for STFZ samples irradiated with 6 MeV electrons [19], have been observed in the freshly 27 MeV electron irradiated samples. Weak, anisotropic paramagnetic defects have also been observed at T < 150 K, under 1.06 μm in-situ illumination. Their intensity markedly increased after the first step of isochronal annealing at 150 °C. Figure 1(a) presents the sequence of ESR spectra recorded at 100 K, from such a STFZ sample freshly irradiated with 27 MeV electrons and annealed for 30 min at 150 °C, for the magnetic field rotated in a (110) crystal plane, in steps of 5°. Groups of ESR lines with similar saturation behavior, very likely belonging to the same IPPDs, have been identified from the analysis of the ESR lines intensity vs. microwave power and temperature. Further on, by comparing their experimental line position angular dependence with computer simulations based on published data [10,11], one could identify in each case the proposed/accepted structural model of the center responsible for each group of lines. One can see that the angular variation of the line positions fitted with the spin Hamiltonian parameters of the corresponding paramagnetic center given in Table I describes accurately, in each case, the experimentally observed variation of the line positions, confirming the validity of the proposed identification. Based on this procedure, we have identified in the ESR spectra of the freshly irradiated and isochronally annealed STFZ samples several IPPDs, which will be described further.
We have also recorded the ESR spectra of a freshly irradiated STFZ sample subjected to isochronal annealing. Changes in the relative intensity of the ESR lines, reflecting variations in relative concentration of the identified IPPDs have been determined within the estimated ±25% experimental errors. Figure 1(b) presents the spectra of a freshly irradiated STFZ sample isochronally annealed up to 300 °C, while Fig. 2(a) presents the relative variation in the concentration of the observed IPPDs vs. the isochronal annealing temperature T_{ann}.
According to the data presented in Figs. 1(a), 1(b), and 2(a), one could distinguish in the STFZ sample freshly irradiated with 27 MeV electrons and further subjected to isochronal annealing the spectra of the following IPPDs:
The ESR spectrum of the G7/[V_{2}]^{−} negatively charged divacancy center, one of the best known and dominant point defect in Si irradiated with high energy particles, exhibits at lower temperatures (T < 70 K) a monoclinic symmetry [23–25]. At higher temperatures, it is subjected to thermally activated reorientation from one direction of the Jahn-Teller distortion to another, resulting in a motionally averaged ESR spectrum with a trigonal symmetry [24,26].
It is known that its ESR spectrum is observed when the Fermi energy in the band gap is below E_{F} = E_{c} − 0.4 eV, a situation valid for the electron irradiated n-type high resistivity STFZ [24]. We did observe at T > 100 K, in the as-irradiated samples, its high temperature spectrum, with the axial ⟨111⟩ symmetry. The 1.06 μm band-gap illumination increased its intensity. As expected, the observed angular dependence [Fig. 1(a)] could be simulated with an axial spin Hamiltonian with S = ½, g_{ǁ} = 2.0117, and g_{⊥} = 2.0080 parameter values, practically identical with those reported in the literature [10,26]. Measurements at T < 50 K resulted in the observation of the low temperature ESR spectrum, which could also be fitted in the limit of experimental errors with the known g-values (Table I) of the monoclinic [V_{2}]^{−} centers [23]. According to data presented in Fig. 2(a), the [V_{2}]^{−} center observed in the freshly irradiated sample is thermally stable up to 250 °C and begins to decay at higher temperatures, in agreement with previous investigations on STFZ samples irradiated with lower energy electrons [24,27].
The spectrum of the A3/[V_{4}]^{−} negatively charged tetravacancy center, with S = ½ ground state and trigonal symmetry, which could be barely observed in the sample freshly irradiated with 27 MeV electrons, was found to increase in intensity by low temperature 1.06 μm illumination. This center has been previously observed in neutron irradiated Czochralski (CzSi) and floating zone (FzSi) grown silicon after subsequent annealing at T_{ann} > 150 °C, a process accompanied by the decay of initially formed neutrally charged P3/[V_{4}]^{0} tetravacancy centers [22,28]. The four-vacancy structure in two parallel {111} planes, resulting in a local axial ⟨111⟩ symmetry, was demonstrated by ESR monitored stress induced defect alignment experiments [29]. As shown in Fig. 1(a) and Table I, the recorded spectra angular dependence is well fitted with a SH with trigonal ⟨111⟩ symmetry and known parameters [22,30]. The low intensity A3 centers' spectrum of the 27 MeV electrons freshly irradiated sample increases by thermal annealing at T_{ann} = 150 °C and decays at T_{ann} = 250 °C [Fig. 2(a)]. A similar annealing behavior was reported in the neutron irradiated FzSi samples [22].
The presence of the N/P1/[V_{5}]^{−} negatively charged pentavacancy centers in the freshly irradiated sample has been identified in a barely visible group of ESR lines with angular dependence corresponding to monoclinic I symmetry and SH parameters (Table I) close to those of the so-called N centers with S = ½ ground state observed in various neutron-irradiated Si samples after annealing at T_{ann} = 170 °C [31]. The N center, reported to be stable up to T = 300 °C and exhibiting a strong temperature variation of the SH parameters, is identical with the P1 center, also produced by high fluence neutrons (>1 × 10^{17} cm^{−2}) and attributed to a negatively charged non-planar pentavacancy P1/[V_{5}]^{−} defect [32]. One should mention that the intensity of the ESR spectrum of the N/P1 centers in our 27 MeV electron irradiated STFZ samples did not depend on illumination and begun to decay at T_{ann} > 250 °C, a somehow lower temperature compared to their reported decay at T > 300 °C in the neutron irradiated Si [22,31].
Two more IPPDs, with small concentration, visible in the ESR spectra of the freshly irradiated samples have also been identified after annealing at 150 °C:
The ESR spectrum angular dependence of the PK1/[V_{5}]^{−} negatively charged pentavacancy center, visible at T = 100 K in the samples annealed at 150 °C [Fig. 1(a)], with increasing intensity under 1.06 μm in-situ illumination, is described by a SH with the triclinic symmetry and S = ½ ground state. The fitting SH parameters of the recorded spectra (Table I) were found to be slightly different from those of the PK1 center reported at 70 K, in both n- and p-type STFZ irradiated with neutrons (3 × 10^{17} n/cm^{2}) and annealed at 150 °C [33]. The difference seems very likely to result from their measuring temperature variation, as observed for other N/P1 pentavacancy centers [22,31]. The PK1 center, with the triclinic symmetry, was tentatively attributed [33] to one of the seven possible configurations of a pentavacancy [V_{5}]^{−}. Its concentration was found to decrease in the n-irradiated samples at T_{ann} > 200 °C, a somehow lower temperature compared to the corresponding T_{ann} > 250 °C value observed in our 27 MeV electron irradiated sample.
The ESR spectrum of the G15/[C_{i} - O_{i}]^{+} center, also known as the [V–O–C]^{+} center, barely visible at T = 100 K in the freshly irradiated and annealed at 150 °C sample [Fig. 1(a)], has been previously reported in the ESR spectra of the oxygen rich CzSi silicon irradiated with 3.5 and 27 MeV electrons [14,34,35]. The presently observed spectrum angular dependence could be simulated with the SH parameters of the G15/[C_{i} - O_{i}]^{+} center with the monoclinic I (C_{1h}) symmetry (see Table I). Initially called the K center, it was first reported in p-type STFZ irradiated with 7 MeV electrons [20]. It was suggested that the production of the G15 center requires oxygen doping levels of 1 × 10^{18} cm^{−3} [35]. However, this oxygen concentration limit may actually be much lower, considering that its ESR spectrum could be observed in p-type FzSi doped by diffusion with carbon and further on with 1 × 10^{17} cm^{−2} oxygen concentration [34]. Moreover, as previously mentioned, traces of the G15 centers were found in the ESR spectra recorded at T = 100 K, under 1.06 μm illumination of our n-type STFZ samples with c(O) = 1 × 10^{16} cm^{−3} irradiated with 27 MeV electrons and annealed at 150 °C. According to deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) measurements [36] on boron doped Si, the transition energy level observed at E_{v} + 0.38 eV was associated with the G15 centers.
One should mention the presence in some of the ESR spectra presented in Figs. 1(a)–1(d), recorded with the magnetic field oriented along the ⟨110⟩ or ⟨100⟩ main directions, of a few lines which could not be associated with any particular paramagnetic center. The reason is that once the sample was rotated away from the main directions, these lines split in several components of too low intensity to be followed during the angular variation determinations.
B. ESR spectra of the 27 MeV electrons irradiated STFZ samples further aged for 3.5 years at 250 K: Isochronal annealing experiments
The low temperature ESR spectrum of the STFZ sample irradiated with 27 MeV electrons and subsequently aged for 3.5 years at T = 250 K consists [Fig. 1(c)] of a group of lines with similar saturation properties, insensitive to the in-situ illumination. Its angular dependence in a (110) plane could be fitted with a SH with the local monoclinic I symmetry, spin S = 1, and spectra parameters (Table I) known to describe the neutral {110} planar tetravacancy P3/[V_{4}]^{0} center [22]. No other ESR transitions of significant intensity were detected in these samples.
The paramagnetic P3/[V_{4}]^{0} neutral tetravacancy center, initially reported as the (II, III) center in both CzSi and FzSi irradiated with high-fluence (∼1 × 10^{18} n/cm^{2}) neutrons [30], was further observed in neutron [22,28,29] and proton [37] irradiated FzSi. Its structural model, established by ESR monitored stress induced experiments, consists of a {110}—planar tetravacancy chain [29,32]. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the decay of the P3/[V_{4}]^{0} centers observed in the aged samples at T_{ann} > 150 °C is accompanied by the formation and increase in the concentration of the N/P1/[V_{5}]^{−} and A3/[V_{4}]^{−} centers [Fig. 1(d)]. A similar behavior under thermal annealing was previously observed in the neutron irradiated FzSi and CzSi samples [22,28,30]. Both N/P1/[V_{5}]^{−} and P3/[V_{4}]^{0} centers further decay in our aged STFZ samples at T_{ann} > 200–250 °C. A somehow similar behavior was observed in the n-irradiated Si samples [22], with the difference that the N/P1/[V_{5}]^{−} centers completely decayed only at T_{ann} ∼ 450 °C. In addition, a small concentration of G15/[C_{i}-O_{i}]^{+} centers was observed in the our 27 MeV electrons irradiated and aged STFZ samples at T_{ann} > 200 °C. No effect of 1.06 μm in-situ illumination on the ESR spectrum of the P3/[V_{4}]^{0} centers has been observed.
Our efforts to observe the ESR spectra of other small cluster multivacancy defects, such as the A4/[V_{3}]^{−} centers with the orthorhombic symmetry, or the monoclinic A8, and trigonal A9 centers reported [22,28] in the n-irradiated Si samples after annealing at T_{ann} = 150 °C, have been unsuccessful. Moreover, as in the case of the STFZ sample freshly irradiated with 27 MeV electrons, we could not observe in the ESR spectrum of the aged samples ESR lines from the di-interstitial P6/[Si(i)_{2}]^{+} and A5/[Si(i)_{2}]^{0} centers, reported in the neutron irradiated Si.
C. Discussion
The analysis of the data presented in Secs. III A and III B suggests that the nature and annealing properties of the main paramagnetic small-cluster multivacancy (tetra- and penta-vacancy) defects observed in the 27 MeV electron irradiated and aged STFZ [Figs. 1(c) and 1(d)] are similar with those previously reported in neutron irradiated FzSi and CzSi [22,28–30]. Namely, the P3/[V_{4}]^{0} centers observed in the irradiated and aged sample decay at T_{ann} > 150 °C, with the formation of increased concentration of the N/P1/[V_{5}]^{−} and A3/[V_{4}]^{−} centers, which further decay at T_{ann} > 200–250 °C [Fig. 2(b)].
Meanwhile, the freshly 27 MeV electrons irradiated STFZ exhibit a somehow different behavior compared to the n-irradiated samples [22,29]. Their ESR spectra [Figs. 1(a) and 1(b)] already consist of lines from the main negatively charged tetravacancy A3/[V_{4}]^{−}, divacancy G7/[V_{2}]^{−}, and pentavacancy N/P1/[V_{5}]^{−} centers, as well as from small amounts of PK1/[V_{5}]^{−} and G15/[C_{i} - O_{i}]^{+} centers. Moreover, the concentration of all these centers increases by annealing at 150 °C, remain stable up to 250 °C, and decrease at higher annealing temperatures [Fig. 2(a)].
One should also note that compared to both our 27 MeV e-irradiated and aged STFZ samples, the n-irradiated Si samples exhibited additional ESR lines from the paramagnetic di-interstitial centers. Their production in a comparable concentration with the small cluster vacancy centers seems very likely to reflect the more efficient n-irradiation knock-out process accompanied by a stronger separation from the recombinant vacancy-type centers, as compared to the electron irradiated samples.
We found very few published results concerning the IPPDs in electron irradiated FzSi to compare with, as the majority of the ESR investigations have been done on oxygen rich CzSi irradiated with ∼2 MeV electrons, at fluences from 1 × 10^{15} cm^{−2} to 1.2 × 10^{19} cm^{−2} [21,38,39]. These investigations report the observation of divacancies and various impurity trapped [V_{n}-O_{m}]-type centers (n, m < 4), the formation of the latter ones being explained by the excellent vacancy trapping properties of the oxygen impurity, which inhibits the vacancies agglomeration resulting in multivacancy centers [40,41]. It has also been shown [39] that in-situ illumination at T = 125 K resulted in an increase in the concentration of the G7/[V_{2}]^{−} defects and a decrease in the concentration of the A14/[V_{2} – O]^{0} centers (initially called I1 centers). The need of illumination to make some of the paramagnetic centers visible has also been mentioned by Watkins [14]. Investigations on production of defects in CzSi by irradiation with higher energy electrons (<56 MeV) did evidence only single vacancy and divacancy defects [40].
Researches on electron irradiated FzSi samples were mainly performed on samples irradiated with low energy electrons (1–4 MeV) and resulted in the detailed characterization of the divacancy in several charge states, namely, G7/[V_{2}]^{−}, G6/[V_{2}]^{+}, NL11/[V_{2}]^{0}, and of the vacancy-oxygen B1/[V-O]^{−} defect [21,23,24,42–47]. One should note that in one of these works [46], it was explicitly mentioned that the P3/[V_{4}]^{0} centers could not be observed in such electron irradiated FzSi.
To our knowledge, this is the first time that the predominant formation, besides divacancies of small defect clusters of multivacancy (tetra- and pentavacancy) IPPDs in electron irradiated FzSi, is reported. Our result seems possible considering that the nature of the dominant type of resulting IPPDs is known to vary with the energy and fluence of the irradiating electrons and the concentration of vacancy-trapping impurities [21,39,40,48]. Unexpected is the radical change in the nature of the dominant paramagnetic defects observed in the freshly irradiated samples, compared to those irradiated and aged at T ∼ 250 K, i.e., the replacement of the main G7/[V_{2}]^{−}, A3/[V_{4}]^{−}, and N/P1/[V_{5}]^{−} defects, observed in the freshly irradiated sample, by the P3/[V_{4}]^{0} center alone in the irradiated and aged samples [Fig. 2(b)].
The formation of small-cluster multivacancy A3/[V_{4}]^{−} and N/P1/[V_{5}]^{−} centers in the samples freshly irradiated with 27 MeV electrons could be explained by two mechanisms: (a) the aggregation of the high concentration of primary divacancy centers produced by the high fluence 27 MeV electrons and (b) the direct formation by a cascade of secondary recoils across the path of the high energy electron.
(a) The aggregation of divacancies cannot be excluded considering the large concentration of primary divacancies resulting from irradiation. Indeed, this possibility is favored by their predominantly one-step hopping mechanism of diffusion, that is, two vacancies move together, with an estimated activation energy of ∼1.3 eV [49], in agreement with experimental data [24]. The migrating divacancies can interact with other defects/impurities from the lattice, resulting in divacancy–impurity pairing with impurities such as oxygen and/or carbon. Thus, the divacancy–oxygen interaction was suggested as the main mechanism of divacancy elimination in CzSi upon annealing [24,27,38,50,51]. This mechanism can also explain the formation of the minor amount of G15/[C_{i} - O_{i}]^{+} centers observed in our freshly 27 MeV electron irradiated low oxygen and carbon content STFZ. One should note that Monakhov et_al [52] concluded from experiments on oxygenated FzSi samples the presence of a significant energy barrier for the V_{2} + O_{i} = V_{2}O reaction which can make this mechanism less efficient. Another possibility, which seems more likely in the low oxygen content STFZ samples, is the association of two closely spaced V_{2} centers by the reaction: V_{2} + V_{2} = V_{4}. According to the simple cluster model for neutron irradiation produced defects in silicon [47,53], because the divacancies are little mobile at RT, this reaction is limited to the divacancies separated by a distance no larger than the corresponding capture radius. It means that the concentration of tetravacancies will depend on the concentration of divacancies. This mechanism can also explain the presence of the tetravacancy centers in the freshly irradiated samples, but not of the pentavacancy N/P1/[V_{5}]^{−} and PK1/[V_{5}]^{−} centers.
(b) One expects that multivacancies, as small cluster defects, are also produced directly by irradiation with high energy electrons from a chain of neighboring vacancies by a cascade of secondary recoils across the path of the high energy electron in a separate (110) plane, as in the case of neutron irradiation of FzSi [3,47,48]. Indeed, according to theoretical studies, the ring multivacancy V_{m} (m = 1,…7) defects, except the hexavacancy, introduce deep levels into the band gap, with stable configurations for the tri-, tetra-, and pentavacancies [54,55]. Measurements of the cluster center formation in n-irradiated CzSi and FzSi samples have also shown that P3/[V_{4}]^{0} and P6 di-interstitial centers are formed in the primary cascade [56]. Radiation defect formation in n-type CzSi and FzSi by electrons with energy in the 2.5 to 1200 MeV has shown the formation of clusters of defects for E > 10 MeV, as well as variation in their formation rate with radiation energy [48]. Our experimental results demonstrate that the cluster formation mechanism is active under irradiation with 27 MeV electrons as well. It is not so clear why trivacancies have not been observed. One possible explanation is that their concentration resulting from secondary recoils is much smaller as compared to the other observed small cluster defects. Moreover, it was suggested [47] that trivacancies interact with diffusing divacancies resulting in pentavacancies. One could thus explain the dominant concentration of tetra- and pentavacancies as compared to divacancies observed [Fig. 2(a)] in the freshly 27 MeV electron irradiated STFZ.
Although the formation of the tetra- and penta-vacancy defects in the freshly 27 MeV electron irradiated sample after annealing at T = 150 °C is quite similar to the case of the neutron irradiated FzSi [28], one also notices important differences. First, the additional production after irradiation of the negatively charged G7/[V_{2}]^{−} divacancy and A3/[V_{4}]^{−} tetravacancy centers, which were not observed in the n-irradiated samples. Second, the lower production rate, below the ESR sensitivity level, of the interstitial centers, as compared to the n-irradiated samples.
The unexpected observation of the dominant neutral tetravacancy P3/[V_{4}]^{0} center in the STFZ sample irradiated and aged at T ∼ 250 K and the total absence of the other centers observed in the freshly irradiated STFZ sample can be explained by the presence of a slow, but still efficient interaction-recombination process of the tetra- and pentavacancy centers with the still mobile divacancies during such long-time aging. One could thus explain the total absence of divacancy centers in the aged sample as a result of their pairing, with an increased concentration of tetravacancy P3/[V_{4}]^{0} centers and by their combination with the tetra- and pentavacancy centers produced by the initial irradiation, resulting in even larger cluster centers, very likely ESR silent. The aggregation of the small defect clusters could be accelerated by annealing the irradiated samples above RT, a process observed by high resolution transmission electron microscopy [3]. Therefore, one finds a balance of multivacancy defects in the aged sample similar to the case of the neutron irradiated Si samples.
The increase in the concentration of the IPPDs in the sample freshly irradiated and annealed to 150 °C [Fig. 2(a)] needs an explanation. Such an effect has been previously observed, but not explained, in neutron irradiated samples [22,28]. One could explain this property by the presence of neighboring interstitials in the irradiated sample, produced simultaneously with the vacancies and ejected at various positions, close enough to the vacancy defects to perturb their local crystal field. Their presence would result in a supplementary local crystal field of both variable intensity and symmetry at each paramagnetic defect, resulting in line broadening effects, diminishing the amplitude of the ESR signal from the corresponding IPPDs. Such interstitials would migrate by annealing above RT, being trapped further away from the investigated IPPDs. Their migration further restores the local lattice order at the investigated paramagnetic defects, resulting in narrower, more intense ESR lines. Indeed, recent experimental and theoretical investigations have shown [57] that annealing at 150 °C samples irradiated at high doses results in trapping of interstitials (Si_{i}) by C_{i}O_{i} defects forming C_{i}O_{i}(Si_{i})_{n} complexes, thus confirming our proposed explanation.
The presence of the negatively charged A3/[V_{4}]^{−} and neutral P3/[V_{4}]^{0} tetravacancy centers in the ESR spectra of the freshly electron irradiated and of the aged STFZ, respectively, seem to be related to changes in the Fermi energy position in the band-gap, which depends, besides temperature, on doping and deep-level defects concentrations. It is known that the stability of a paramagnetic defect in a certain charge state is determined by the localization of its corresponding charge state transition levels and the position of the Fermi energy in the band-gap. Thus, for a known Fermi energy at a certain temperature, the charge transition levels of a defect type allow to calculate the fraction of such defects in each charge state and to determine the most stable one. The presence of the A3/[V_{4}]^{−} defect in small amounts in the electron irradiated and annealed to 150 °C sample and its strong concentration increase by illumination with above the band gap light strongly suggests that, at the detection temperature, the Fermi level lies close to the (0/-) defect charge transition level. A similar intensity variation under illumination is observed for the pentavacancy PK1/[V_{5}]^{−} and divacancy G7/[V_{2}]^{−} centers. According to previous studies [24] on electron irradiated n-type Si, the (0/-) defect charge transition level of the single negatively charged divacancy lies at E^{−} ∼ E_{v} + 0.6 eV. Under the assumption of defect concentration homogeneity over the sample one expects comparable (0/-) defect charge state transition values for the negatively charged A3/[V_{4}]^{−} and PK1/[V_{5}]^{−} defects. Meanwhile, the concentration of the P1/[V_{5}]^{−} centers hardly changes upon illumination, which implies that the Fermi level is close to the center of the stability region of this defect charge state. The presence in the ESR spectra of the aged samples of the neutral tetravacancy P3/[V_{4}]^{0} centers, insensitive to above the gap illumination, suggests a lowering of the Fermi energy in the band gap, very likely resulting from the massive decay of the divacancies and possible of the tetra and pentavacancy defects [47]. This is supported by studies of neutron irradiated FzSi which revealed the presence, besides interstitials, of the P3/[V_{4}]^{0} centers [22,28]. In such samples, the Fermi energy was found [47] to be pinned at E_{v} + 0.39 eV, lower than in the freshly irradiated STFZ. One concludes that aging STFZ samples irradiated with high doses of 27 MeV electrons results in lowering the Fermi energy in the band-gap.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
Our ESR investigation concerning the production, nature, and stability of the irradiation paramagnetic point defects (IPPDs) produced by high fluence (2 × 10^{16} cm^{−2}) 27 MeV electrons in P-doped, n-type standard floating zone silicon, in both freshly irradiated samples and long term (3.5 years) stored samples after irradiation at T = 250 K lead to some new, unexpected observations.
Thus, it was found that small negatively charged tetravacancy and pentavacancy clusters are directly produced by high energy (27 MeV) electron irradiation of the STFZ samples, a process which was not observed by irradiation with low energy (<5 MeV) electrons, but was found to be similar to the case of neutron irradiated silicon. This experimental result strongly suggests that the direct cluster formation mechanism, which explained the defect production in neutron irradiated silicon, is also active under irradiation with 27 MeV electrons, confirming early theoretical predictions [48].
It has also been also observed that in the samples stored at T = 250 K for long periods after irradiation, the small vacancy cluster defects, namely, the divacancies, tetravacancies, and pentavacancies, as well as the smaller amounts of interstitial carbon - oxygen G15/[C_{i}-O_{i}]^{+} and low symmetry pentavacancy PK1/[V_{5}]^{−} defects observed in the freshly irradiated sample, are replaced by the neutral tetravacancy P3/[V_{4}]^{0} centers. This unexpected result is attributed to the diffusion of the divacancies even at the relatively low 250 K temperature, resulting in their pairing in tetravacancies, as well as by their interaction–recombination with the larger radiation induced tetra- and pentavacancy centers, resulting in larger ESR silent vacancy clusters, a process which can be accelerated by annealing at higher temperatures.
We also found some differences in the production of IPPDs by irradiation with neutrons and 27 MeV electrons, namely, a lower production rate of di-interstitial centers in the latter case, attributed to a lower production rate and a smaller separation by electron irradiation, as well as a different thermal stability of the IPPDs produced in the two cases, very likely from a more complex process.
TABLE I. 
Production and ESR spectra parameters of the IPPDs evidenced in STFZ irradiated with electrons of 27 MeV at high fluence (2 × 10^{16} cm^{−2}) compared with published data. Except the P3/[V_{4}]^{0} center with spin S = 1, the other IPPDs exhibit S = ½ ground state. Symmetry notations according to Madelung and Schultz [10] and Umeda et_al [11]: Monoclinic = Mcl.; Triclinic = Tricl; Trigonal = Trig. The SH parameters were determined by fitting the experimental angular dependence with simulations in which the g-components were varied. Reported orientation of the principal directions used in spectra simulations is given for the Mcl.-1 local symmetry by the rotation angle (θ).
