THz generation by laser coupling to carbon nanotube array
A viable scheme of THz radiation generation by beating of two lasers (ω_{1}, k→{1}; ω_{2}, k→{2}) in a nanotube array, mounted on a dielectric substrate, is proposed and studied. The free electrons of the nanotubes acquire a large oscillatory velocity and experience a beat frequency ponderomotive force that turns nanotubes into oscillating dipole antennae emitting THz radiation. The THz power peaks in directions where a phase difference between fields due to successive nanotubes is integral multiple of 2π. The THz power is large when the beat frequency equals ω_{p}/2 (where ω_{p} is the electron plasma frequency) and surface plasmon resonance occurs. For our set of laser and carbon nanotube parameters, the generated THz is about 0.1 kW for CO_{2} laser power of 10 GW and pulse length of a few picoseconds.
I. INTRODUCTION
The carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have electron plasma frequencies in the THz range, hence appear to be a favorable medium for terahertz radiation generation via nonlinear coupling with lasers [1–3]. The existing schemes of THz generation involve the interaction of high power laser or relativistic electron beam with semiconductors and plasmas [4–12]. Presently, there is an increased interest in THz science in employing metallic nanotubes and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to produce THz radiations as these structures provide the advantage of compactness with significant efficiency [1]. Gildenburg and Vvdenskii [13] have reported an interesting result on tunnel ionization by laser plasma interaction. The electron produced via tunnel ionization retains finite residual transverse momentum after the laser pulse is gone and sets in transverse oscillations about the ion cylinder with the natural frequency ω_{p}/2, where ω_{p} is electron plasma frequency. The oscillating electron cylinder acts as an oscillating dipole and produces THz radiation.
Kibis and Portnoi [14] investigated a scheme of THz generation in which heating of the electron gas in CNTs due to electric field can produce population inversion of the electron sub bands with energy difference in the THz range. Titova et_al [15] have reported the generation of polarized terahertz pulses from single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) array from femtosecond (fs) optical pulses in the absence of external bias. A built-in electric field in the semiconducting SWCNTs is generated by top-bottom asymmetry in the SWCNTs array, which produces polarized THz radiation due to transient photocurrent. Portnoi et_al [16] have shown that quasi metallic carbon nanotubes, with the application of potential difference, can emit THz radiation and maximum spectral density has strong dependence on the applied voltage. They find that tunable THz detectors and emitters can be created by armchair carbon nanotubes with the effect of magnetic field. Shuba et_al [17] have studied the electromagnetic properties of SWCNT film on the surface of silica fibers and reported the antenna resonance in the THz range with a low temperature photoconductivity measurement. The concept of thermal radiation in the THz range from a metallic carbon nanotube caused by the formation of discrete spectral lines due to geometrical nano-antenna resonances is theoretically investigated by Nemilentsau et_al [18] Wang et_al [19] have shown that CNT antenna increases the bandwidth of high frequency THz radiation in comparison with photoconductive antenna. THz radiation properties emitted by a metallic CNT antenna have been investigated experimentally by Wang and Wu [20] in THz waveform and field distribution. Parashar and Sharma [21] have studied the generation of THz radiation by optical rectification of amplitude modulated laser in a vertical array of CNTs mounted on a metallic base. A scheme to generate THz radiation by passing an electron bunch over a nanotube array across their lengths has been studied by Kumar and Kumar [22]. A beat wave terahertz (THz) undulator formed by the beating of two laser pulses at normal incidence to the electron-moving direction has been proposed by Chang et_al [23] to realize a higher gain X-ray Free electron laser [24].
In the present paper, we study the nonlinear mixing of two lasers in an array of CNTs embedded on a dielectric base to generate THz radiation. The two lasers of frequency (ω_{1},ω_{2}) and wave vectors (k→{1}, k→{2}) impinged on the CNTs array with an angle θ_{0}. A beat ponderomotive force is exerted on the electrons of the carbon nanotubes at beating frequency ω=ω_{1}−ω_{2}, where ω is in the THz range, inducing a nonlinear current. These oscillating CNTs array act as antennae to generate THz radiation at beating frequency. In Sec. II, we drive nonlinear current density. In Sec. III, we calculate vector potential and radiated power at THz frequency. Discussion is given in Sec. IV.
II. NONLINEAR CURRENT DENSITY
Consider a dielectric surface embedded with cylindrical carbon nanotubes (CNTs) of radius r_{c}, length l_{c}, free electron density n_{0e}, and nanotube axis along ŷ as shown in Fig. 1. Two P-polarized lasers of frequencies ω_{1} and ω_{2} are obliquely incident on the CNTs array (x=0) at an angle θ_{0} with respect to the z-axis. The laser electric field as seen by the CNTs can be written as the superposition of the incident and reflected waves
where j=1,2, ω=ω_{1}−ω_{2}, and ω is in the THz range. R_{A} is the amplitude reflection coefficient of reflected wave from the dielectric surface [23]
where ε_{g} is the permittivity of the dielectric material.
Under the laser electric field, the electrons of a CNT are displaced by a distance Δ→ with respect to the ion cylinder. When Δ→ is perpendicular to the axis of the CNT, a space charge field E→{s}=n_{0e}eΔ→/2ε_{0} is created in the overlap region of the electron and ion cylinders. Under the combined fields of the laser fields and the space charge fields, the drift velocities of electrons turn out to be
where ω_{p}=n_{0e}e^{2}/ε_{0}m, −e, and m are the electron charge and mass and ε_{0} is the free space permittivity and ε_{L} is the relative permittivity of the lattice. For Δ→∥ŷ, there is no space charge restoration force. The lasers also exert a ponderomotive force on CNT electrons
Here, we have taken reflection coefficient to be real R_{A}=RA*.
The oscillatory velocity of electrons due to the ponderomotive force can be written as
The nonlinear current density inside a single CNT at ω can be written as

III. THz VECTOR POTENTIAL AND RADIATED POWER
Now, consider a planar array of CNTs with their lengths along ŷ axis and centers at (n_{1}d_{0}ẑ,n_{2}b_{0}ŷ), n_{1}=0,1,2……..N_{1}, and n_{2}=0,1,2……..N_{2}. By acting as an oscillatory dipole, a CNT produces a vector potential. Total vector potential due to entire CNTs array at a far point can be written as
where r→{n1,n2}=n_{1}dcosθẑ+n_{2}bsinθsinϕŷ. For r≫|r→{n1,n2}|, one may write
ψ_{1}=ωdc(cosθ−cosθ_{0}) and ψ_{2}=ωbcsinθsinϕ; where θ is the angle of direction of observation r̂ makes with z axis.
The magnetic field at r→ (far distance) is
The time average Poynting's vector using above equation can be written as
where
and
THz power conversion efficiency is of the order of the ratio of total THz power to incident laser power and calculated at a far distance in (θ, ϕ) direction and written as
In Fig. 2, we have shown the variation of THz power conversion efficiency, that is, ratio of Total THz power and total incident laser power, with angle θ_{0} for the following set of parameters: ω=0.98ω_{p}/2 (red line) and ω=0.96ω_{p}/2 (blue line), ω_{2}=2×10^{14}rad/s,r_{c}ω_{p}/c=0.002,r_{0}=120μmε_{g}=2.5(glass),a_{2}=eA_{20}mω_{2}c≈0.03 (corresponding to incident CO_{2} laser power ∼10 GW at 10.6μm wavelength), ω_{p}∼3×10^{15}rad/s for N_{1}=1000,N_{2}=60,l=2μm, r_{c}=20nm, and separation between CNTs d=30nm. The radiated THz power increases with angle, attains a maximum for θ_{0}=48.75°, and then decreases gradually for higher values of angle θ_{0}. THz power has a strong maxima in those directions, where
and
In those directions, S=N12N22 for ψ_{1}=0 and ψ_{2}=0 or when ψ_{1} and ψ_{2} are integral multiples of 2π. It is observed that a strong enhancement in the power is observed in the direction for which ψ_{1}=0 and ψ_{2}=0. This condition is achieved when ϕ=0 and for any value of θ (direction of observation). One may note that we get maximum power when θ=θ_{0}, which is called in the direction of specular reflection.
In Fig. 3, we have shown the variation of THz power with the normalized THz frequency at ϕ=0°,θ_{0}=48.75° and θ_{0}=70°. The other parameters are same as given in Fig. 2. THz power has a strong dependence on the THz frequency. The resonant enhancement in THz power is observed as ω approaches ω_{p}/2, where ω_{p} is electron plasma frequency of the carbon nanotubes. Enhancement in the THz power occurs due to plasmon resonance at ω∼ω_{p}/2. There is a sharp reduction in the THz power as one moves away from the resonance point (ω∼ω_{p}/2). Zhang et_al [1] investigated experimentally that a broad and strong conductivity peak in metallic and doped semiconducting CNTs is caused by the phenomena of plasmon resonance.
In Fig. 4, we have displayed the variation of THz power conversion efficiency with normalized electron plasma frequency (ω_{p}/ω_{2}). We have also plotted the optimally generated THz frequency as function of ω_{p}/ω_{2}, presuming that ω_{1} is suitably changed to attain this frequency, that is, ω_{1}=ω_{2}+ω. The CNTs with higher electron density produce higher THz power. The frequency of the generated THz increases linearly with ω_{p}/ω_{2}.
IV. DISCUSSION
THz radiation generation by laser beat wave excitation in a carbon nanotubes (CNTs) array embedded on a dielectric surface appears a viable scheme. Lasers exert a beat ponderomotive force on CNTs electrons to produce nonlinear current, driving THz radiation at ω_{p}/2. CNTs act as oscillating dipole array and emit THz radiation at beat frequency (ω=ω_{1}−ω_{2}). For typical parameters, radiated terahertz power turns out to be ∼ 0.1 kW for incident CO_{2} laser power of 10 GW. An enhancement in the THz power is achieved due to plasmon resonance at when ω∼ω_{p}/2. Significant variation in the THz power is observed with the angle of incidence of lasers. One may note that maximum power is obtained in the directions where ψ_{1}=ωdc(cosθ−cosθ_{0}) and ψ_{2}=ωbcsinθsinϕ are integral multiples of 2π.
The laser breakdown of the dielectric base is a limiting mechanism for the proposed scheme. Threshold intensity for dielectric breakdown of glass with Nd: glass laser (1.06 μm) is 6×10^{13}W/cm{2}. With CO_{2} laser, it may be two orders of magnitude smaller; hence, the present theory is applicable for intensity ≤6×10^{11}W/cm{2}, that is, a_{2}≤0.03. The present scheme offers a good possibility of creating compact and high power THz sources.
Our treatment is valid for lasers of uniform intensity; that is when the laser spot size is much bigger than the nanotube array. In the case when the spot size of the laser is comparable to the size of the nanotube array the current induced in each nanotube will be a function of its position and function F in Eq. (8) will not be a constant term and has to be replaced by F_{n1,n2}, where F_{n1,n2} depends on the intensity profile of the lasers. Chang et_al [25] have shown the generation of flat top laser with a tapered end to obtain a Gaussian pulse distribution and the effect of incident laser beam shaping on the enhancement of the power gain of the X-ray Free electron laser. In the future, we suggest realizing arbitrary laser profiles to increase the efficiency of THz radiation generation.
