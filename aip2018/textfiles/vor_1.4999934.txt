Suppression of persistent photo-conductance in solution-processed amorphous oxide thin-film transistors
This study offers a combinatorial approach for suppressing the persistent photo-conductance (PPC) characteristic in solution-processed amorphous oxide semiconductor (AOS) thin-film transistors (TFTs) in order to achieve rapid photo-recovery. Various analyses were used to examine the photo-instability of indium-gallium-zinc-oxide (IGZO) TFTs including negative-bias-illumination-stress (NBIS) and transient photo-response behaviors. It was found that the indium ratio in metallic components had a significant impact on their PPC and photo-recovery characteristics. In particular, when the indium ratio was low (51.5%), the PPC characteristic was significantly suppressed and achieving rapid photo-recovery was possible without significantly affecting the electrical performance of AOSs. These results imply that the optimization of the indium composition ratio may allow achieving highly photo-stable and near PPC-free characteristics while maintaining high electrical performance of AOSs. It is considered that the negligible PPC behavior and rapid photo-recovery observed in IGZO TFTs with a lower indium composition are attributed to the less activation energy required for the neutralization of ionized oxygen vacancies.
During the past decade, considerable attention has been paid to solution-processed amorphous oxide semiconductors (AOSs) as active layers for thin-film transistors (TFTs), which are utilized in various applications such as active-matrix-driven displays, photo-sensors, and X-ray detectors [1]. The solution-processed AOSs typically exhibit higher field-effect mobility than that of amorphous Si films [2] and occasionally comparable to that of poly-Si films [3,4]. Moreover, as the solution-processed AOSs can be fabricated over a large-area by using slot-die coating or inkjet printing methods with a low-temperature [5,6], they allow for the expeditious formation of emerging electronic devices such as wearable electronics.
Although the AOSs exhibit high electrical performance, good stability, and uniformity, their light-induced electrical instability issues such as negative-bias illumination stress (NBIS) and persistent photo-conductance (PPC) are still problematic, which may induce a large negative threshold voltage (V_{TH}) shift and slow recovery of conductivity [7], respectively. To minimize these effects and to improve the photo-stability of oxide TFTs, various approaches have been suggested, including back channel passivation using a dense etch stop layer such as SiN_{x} or SiO_{x} [8], top-gate-structure to block the light illumination on the channel area [9], gate dielectrics with low trap density such as AlO_{x} or SiO_{x} [10], and additional gate pulse accelerating the recombination of the electron and VO•• sites [11]. Additionally, concerning the PPC characteristic, an oxygen plasma treatment has been introduced to suppress the PPC effect in ZnO semiconductors by reducing the oxygen vacancies present in the film [12]. Although these advances are noteworthy, it is more desirable to develop an AOS material with inherently less photo-response characteristics and relatively small PPC effects.
In this study, a combinatorial approach for suppressing the PPC characteristic in solution-processed indium-gallium-zinc-oxide (IGZO) TFTs is reported so as to develop inherently less photo-response AOSs. In particular, the role of the indium ratio on the PPC, transient photo-response characteristics, and recovering behavior after illumination-stresses (ISs) were examined. It was found that decreasing the indium composition ratio can weaken the PPC effect and enhance the V_{TH} recovery after illumination stress. More importantly, when the indium composition was reduced to a certain point (e.g., 51.5%), the IGZO TFTs exhibited minimal degradation of electrical performance compared to the IGZO TFTs with an indium ratio of 68.0%. These results indicate that controlling the indium ratio is particularly important to achieve highly photo-stable AOS TFTs while maintaining high electrical performance. In order to thoroughly examine and verify the effect of the indium ratio on photo-response characteristics of IGZO TFTs, the transient photo-response characteristics of IGZO TFTs under pulsed light illumination and their recovery behavior after illumination were analyzed. We suggest that the low photo-response, negligible PPC behavior, and rapid recovery after illumination found in IGZO films with a low indium ratio can be attributed to the lower activation energy (E_{a}) required for the neutralization of ionized oxygen vacancies, which is considered as the origin of the PPC effect in oxide semiconductors [13].
An IGZO precursor was prepared by dissolving indium nitrate hydrate, gallium nitrate hydrate, and zinc nitrate hydrate powders in 2-methoxyethanol. To examine the effect of the indium ratio on photo-response and electrical characteristics of IGZO TFTs, IGZO precursor solutions with different indium ratios (51.5%, 61.4%, and 68.0%) were prepared while the total molar concentration was fixed at 0.125 M. The corresponding In:Ga:Zn composition ratios were In:Ga:Zn = 68.0%:10.0%:22.0%, 61.4%:12.0%:26.5%, and 51.5%:15.2%:33.3%, respectively. Here, each metal composition ratio (C_{metal}) is defined as C_{metal}= M_{metal}/(M_{In} + M_{Gn} + M_{Zn}), where M_{In}, M_{Ga}, and M_{Zn} denote the molar concentration of indium, gallium, and zinc, respectively. The IGZO precursor solution was spin-coated on Si/SiO_{2} wafers after stirring at 75 °C overnight. Afterwards, the spin-coated films were thermal annealed at 350 °C for 1 h in air ambient. Next, aluminum source/drain electrodes were deposited by means of thermal evaporation at a base pressure of ∼3.0 × 10^{−6} Torr on top-contact-structured TFTs. After depositing the source/drain electrodes, the IGZO channel layer was patterned by photolithography and the wet etching process. As a passivation layer, ∼300-nm-thick poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) layer was spin-coated over the device and annealed at 160 °C for 10 min. The width and length of the TFTs were 1000 μm and 50 μm, respectively [Fig. 1(a)].
The electrical characteristics of the IGZO TFTs were analyzed in the dark using a semiconductor parameter analyzer (Agilent 4155C). The characterization of illumination stability and recovery characteristics was carried out by analyzing the transfer characteristics (I_{D}-V_{GS}) under IS (stress time = 3600 s, V_{GS} = 0 V, and light intensity = 0.85 mW/cm^{2}) and NBIS (stress time = 3600 s, V_{GS} = −10 V, and light intensity = 0.85 mW/cm^{2}) conditions. In addition, for the characterization of transient photo-response behavior of IGZO TFTs with different indium ratios, an ultraviolet (UV) light source was illuminated on the devices with pulses of 0.1, 0.6, and 1.2 Hz.
First, in order to determine the composition-dependent variation of electrical properties in an IGZO TFT, IGZO TFTs with different In:Ga:Zn composition ratios (In:Ga:Zn = 68.0%:10.0%:22.0%, 61.4%:12.0%:26.5%, and 51.5%:15.2%:33.3%) were fabricated. Here, it should be noted that due to the different levels of hydratization in metallic precursors, there can be a variation in the metallic composition ratio in the annealed IGZO films [1]. Particularly, in a previous study, we observed a variation of ∼3% in the indium composition ratio when comparing the molar concentration ratio in the precursor solution and the metallic composition ratio in the annealed IGZO film [1]. As shown in Figs. 1(b) and 1(c), the IGZO TFTs in this composition range exhibited similar electrical performance, with a slight decrease in field-effect mobility when decreasing the indium ratio. Particularly, with indium ratios of 68.0, 61.4, and 51.5%, the average field-effect mobilities of 1.49 ± 0.10 cm^{2}/V s, 1.50 ± 0.03 cm^{2}/V s, and 1.23 ± 0.10 cm^{2}/V s were reported, respectively. From these results, it can be claimed that the indium ratio of ∼50% is sufficient to obtain reasonably high field-effect mobility values, which correspond to that of high-indium-ratio IGZO TFTs. To further investigate the composition-dependent photo-response behavior of IGZO TFTs, the influence of IS and NBIS on the electrical characteristics of IGZO TFTs was examined. Figures 2(a)–2(c) illustrate the transfer curves after a recovery period of 60 min after the IS. In the case of IS, the magnitude of the V_{TH} shift (ΔV_{TH}) was relatively small in all devices, with noticeable ΔV_{TH} occurring at higher indium ratios. Notably, when the indium ratio was 51.5%, almost no V_{TH} shift was observed. Although the overall variations were small, it should be noted that when the indium ratio was high (68.0%), V_{TH} was not fully recovered even after the recovery period, indicating that the high-indium-ratio IGZO films are less stable under light illumination.
The influence of the indium composition ratio on the V_{TH} shift and recovery characteristics was more significant under NBIS conditions. Figures 2(d)–2(f) show the variation of transfer characteristics under NBIS with different indium composition ratios. As shown in Fig. 3, the devices reported ΔV_{TH} of −9.51 V, −8.61 V, and −8.21 V under NBIS for IGZO TFTs with indium ratios of 68.0%, 61.4%, and 51.5%, respectively. It is apparent that the IGZO TFTs with a lower indium ratio exhibited a relatively small V_{TH} shift. However, ΔV_{TH} reported under NBIS is larger compared to that obtained under IS conditions, which can be attributed to the hole trapping at the IGZO/SiO_{2} interface by the strong negative gate bias [14]. Nevertheless, it can be considered that by lowering the indium ratio, relatively stable device characteristics could be obtained. More importantly, it was observed that when the indium ratio was small, the recovery of threshold voltages after the NBIS (ΔV_{TH,r}) was larger. As shown in Figs. 2(d), 2(e), and 3, the IGZO TFTs with relatively high indium ratios of 68.0% and 61.4% showed small ΔV_{TH,r} values of +5.41 V and +5.59 V, respectively. In the meanwhile, with an indium ratio of 51.5%, the ΔV_{TH,r} value was +7.16 V which is almost comparable to the ΔV_{TH} value under NBIS (−8.21 V). These results clearly exhibit that the V_{TH} recovery after NBIS was significantly influenced by the indium ratio, and a rapid recovery of I-V characteristics was achievable with a low indium ratio.
Furthermore, the effect of the indium ratio on the PPC behavior of IGZO TFTs was investigated by analyzing the transient photo-response characteristics of IGZO TFTs. UV light-emitting diodes were used as a light source (λ = 380–385 nm and light intensity = 0.6 mW/cm^{2}). In addition, pulsed light with frequencies of 0.1, 0.6, and 1.2 Hz was used rather than a continuous light illumination, and the transient current variation was measured. The pulse width was fixed at 0.5 s for all frequencies. Figure 4(a) illustrates the drain current (I_{D}) variations of IGZO TFTs with different indium ratios (pulse frequency = 0.1 Hz). As shown, each light pulse caused an abrupt increase in drain current, and after the short pulses, the increased current was decayed. It should be noted that the magnitude of the current increase caused by the consecutive light pulses largely varied depending on the indium ratio; moreover, the current decaying behavior also largely varied. Particularly, when the indium ratio was 68.0%, the drain current was increased more than four orders of magnitude after 10 light pulses and showed relatively slow decaying characteristic even after the light pulses. When the indium ratio was 61.4%, a similar increase in drain current was observed by around two orders of magnitude. By further lowering the indium ratio down to 51.5%, the light pulses only caused a temporal increase in current, and after each light pulse, the current was rapidly decayed to its original state (∼1 pA). Similar trends were also observed at higher light pulse frequencies of 0.6 and 1.2 Hz as shown in Figs. 4(b) and 4(c). In these cases, due to the high frequency of light illumination, the current increase rate was more rapid with higher degrees of the current increase, particularly with high indium ratios (61.4% and 68.0%). In contrast, when the indium ratio was 51.5%, the increase in drain current was still relatively small (∼1 order of magnitude) and the current was readily decayed after ceasing the light pulses.
The slow decaying of photo-current after light illumination in IGZO films originates from the PPC behavior in AOSs. In fact, the PPC behaviors are found in various semiconducting materials including metal-oxide, organic, and two-dimensional semiconductors [15–18]. Although the underlying physical mechanism may differ in materials, they often show slow current-decaying characteristics after light illumination. The PPC behavior of AOSs can be mainly attributed to the ionization of oxygen vacancies (VO×→VO••+2e^{⋅}) by light illumination, in which excess electrons are donated to the bulk oxide semiconductor (form shallow donor states), thus increasing the conductivity [Fig. 5(a)] [19–21]. As the neutralization of the ionized oxygen vacancies requires activation energy (thermally activated process), the AOSs maintain high conductivity until a considerable neutralization is occurred. The transient photo-response characteristics shown in Fig. 4 clearly indicate the evidence of PPC behavior in IGZO films, and importantly, the IGZO films with high-indium-ratio exhibited strong PPC behavior compared to low-indium-ratio IGZO films. This relative variation of PPC behavior in IGZO films with different indium concentrations can be explained by the activation energy required for the neutralization of ionized oxygen vacancies [22]. For instance, with higher activation energy, high conductivity is prolonged even after the light is turned off since the neutralization of ionized oxygen vacancies is rather difficult. In contrast, with lower activation energy, the ionized oxygen vacancies can be easily neutralized, and thus, the conductivity can be recovered more rapidly. In order to determine the activation energies of IGZO thin films having different indium ratios, we examined the Arrhenius plots obtained from the temperature-dependent relaxation time constant (τ) as shown in Fig. 5(b). Here, the relaxation time constant was obtained by fitting the photo-decaying curve to the Kohlrausch stretched-exponential function
where τ is the relaxation time constant and β is the stretching exponent. By obtaining the relaxation time constant at different temperatures, the activation energy for neutralizing the ionized oxygen vacancies can be extracted using the equation
where E_{a} is the activation energy for neutralization, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature. The activation energies were extracted from the linear fitting of ln (τ) vs. 1/kT, and the statistics of fitting as a residual sum of squares and adjusted R-square values are shown in Table S1 (supplementary material). The extracted activation energies for IGZO thin films with indium ratios of 68.0%, 61.4%, and 51.5% were 0.476 eV, 0.231 eV, and 0.020 eV, respectively [Figs. 5(b) and 5(c)], showing that the activation energy increases with the indium ratio, which are in a good agreement with the photo-response characteristics of IGZO semiconductors [23,24]. Moreover, to clarify the influence of each metallic component on the photo-response characteristics, we fabricated ternary oxide semiconductors of IZO, IGO, and GZO films having different metallic compositions and their photo-response characteristics (photo-induced current and relaxation time) were evaluated. As shown in Fig. S1, it was observed that the relative amount of indium had the dominant effect on the photo-response characteristics of IZO and IGO films. Particularly, the photo-induced current and the relaxation time were significantly increased with the indium content by several orders of magnitude. In contrast, in the case of GZO thin films, the composition ratio of gallium and zinc had a little influence on the photo-response characteristics. Based on these observations, it can be suggested that the relative amount of indium plays a key role in determining the photo-response characteristics of IGZO films rather than the gallium or zinc. In addition, the physical meaning of relaxation time constant τ is important in understanding its relation with the PPC behavior in IGZO semiconductors. In fact, the relaxation time constant τ is the time required for an exponentially decreasing variable to drop from an initial value to 1/e of that value [Eq. (1)]. Therefore, in the case of photo-decaying characteristics, a large relaxation time represents slow decaying behavior or strong PPC characteristics, while a small relaxation time represents fast decaying behavior or weak PPC characteristics. Supposedly, it can be stated that the relaxation time is related to the lifetime of photo-excited electrons in semiconductors [25–27].
This study reported a combinatorial approach for suppressing the PPC characteristic in solution-processed AOS TFTs. Using various static and transient analyses, it was observed that the indium composition ratio of the IGZO film had a significant impact on the photo-response characteristics. Additionally, the suppressed PPC effect and rapid recovery after light illumination were observed in IGZO films with a low indium ratio. More importantly, it was found that the IGZO TFTs with a relatively low indium ratio exhibited reasonable electrical performances. These results support the concept that optimizing the metallic components of IGZO films is crucial to obtain high photo-stability and negligible PPC characteristics.
