Effect of magnetic coupling on non-radiative relaxation time of Fe^{3+} sites on LaAl_{1−x}Fe_{x}O_{3} pigments
Inorganic pigments of the system LaAl_{1–x}Fe_{x}O_{3} were prepared by the Pechini and the Solid State Reaction (SSR) methods. Magnetic interactions and non-radiative relaxation time were analyzed by means of phase-resolved photoacoustic spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) techniques. EPR results show a change in the magnetic behavior from paramagnetic (x = 0.2 and 0.4) to antiferromagnetic (x = 1.0), which is believed to be a result of the SSR preparation method. Trends in the optical absorption bands of the Fe^{3+} are attributed to their electronic transitions, and the increase in the band's intensity at 480 and 550 nm was assigned to the increase in the magnetic coupling between Fe–Fe. The phase-resolved method is capable of distinguishing between the two preparation methods, and it is possible to infer that SSR modifies the magnetic coupling of Fe–Fe with x.
I. INTRODUCTION
Inorganic pigments have been used since the beginning of civilization in a variety of materials for decoration, makeup, textile production [1–4], ceramics, and in colored flooring and roofs [5]. However, a pigment that exhibits good thermal and color stabilities contains toxic heavy metals in high concentrations and can drastically affect human health and the environment [1,6]. One alternative to avoid the toxicity of pigments containing Cd, Pd, Cr, Mn, and Co is to obtain compounds with Fe^{3+} and rare earths, such as La^{3+}, Ce^{4+}, and Pr^{3+}/Pr^{4+} [6–8]. A previous study [9] has demonstrated that the samples prepared in the LaAl_{1–x}Fe_{x}O_{3} system by the Pechini method presented the potential to be employed in ceramic pigments at decorative burning temperatures and in polymer, when opacity is desired, mainly to replace pigments of the same color that were produced with more toxic elements.
The application of photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS) in this kind of investigation is encouraged, once this technique is characterized by optical absorption spectra measurements by means of a photoacoustic (PA) signal. When a modulated light is focused on a sample in a closed gas chamber, a PA signal is generated. Photo-induced heat is generated by non-radiative decay processes following optical energy absorption by the sample. The magnitude of the photoacoustic signal is directly related to the amount of radiation absorbed by the sample and to the thermal wave propagation from the sample to the surrounding air. PAS is a non-destructive method and has been used in a number of applications for the thermal characterization of gases, liquids, and solids in materials science [10–12] and in the biological and pharmaceutical areas [13–15].
In this context, we investigate LaAl_{1–x}Fe_{x}O_{3} obtained by different methods of synthesis using photoacoustic spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements. We show that the preparation method can strongly influence the neighborhood of Fe^{3+} and the non-radiative relaxation time. The dependence of non-radiative relaxation time on x can affect the material performance in practical application [16], for instance, as a cool material used as a coating on roofs and walls because heat is dissipated via non-radiative relaxation [17].
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ceramic pigments of the LaAl_{1–x}Fe_{x}O_{3} system, with x = 0.20, 0.40, 0.60, 0.80, and 1.00 (LAFRES-2, LAFRES-4, LAFRES-6, LAFRES-8, and LAFRES, respectively), were synthesized by the solid state reaction (SSR) method. The samples prepared by a modified Pechini method, as described in detail in Ref [9], are referred to as follows: LAFP-2, LAFP-4, LAFP-6, LAFP-8, and LAFP. In the SSR method, the precursor reagents La_{2}O_{3} (VETEC, 99.99%), Al_{2}O_{3} (ALCOA, 98.50%), and Fe_{2}O_{3} (VETEC, 98.0%) were mixed and homogenized in a ball mill for 3 h, in wet media with the addition of isopropyl alcohol (99.5%). After milling, the mixture was taken to an oven at 100 °C, for the evaporation of the isopropyl alcohol, and later to the muffle furnace for thermal treatment at 1400 °C for 4 h, with a heating rate of 5 °C/min. The samples were ground in an agate mortar and sieved through a 325 mesh sieve (45 μm).
Structural characterizations were carried out by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a SHIMADZU XRD-6000: CuK_{α} (λ = 1.5406 Å), 40 kV, 30 mA, 2° min^{−1} and 2 θ from 10° to 120°. From the X-ray diffraction data, the fitting of relevant peaks was obtained using the software XFIT [18]. Lattice parameters were obtained by employing the software UnitCellWin [19].
The EPR measurements were performed in a homemade apparatus operating at 9.5 GHz, in the X-band, at room temperature. All results were normalized by the samples mass.
The photoacoustic apparatus uses a Xenon lamp with 1000 W (Oriel, model 6269) as the light source, a monochromator (Oriel, model 74100 Cornerstone^{®} 1/4 m), a mechanical modulator (Stanford Research Systems, model SR540), a lock-in amplifier (Stanford Research Systems, model SR830), and a microphone (Brüel and Kjaer, model 4953) coupled to a sealed photoacoustic cell for signal detection. The data acquisition was performed by a personal computer.
The synchronized detection of the microphone signal with the mechanical modulation is an important feature of photoacoustic spectroscopy. This signal presents a phase delay with light modulation. Considering that only thermal diffusion contributes to the generation of the photoacoustic signal, for a thermally thick sample, the phase ϕ of the PA signal can be derived from the Rosencwaig and Gersho [38] (RG) model and can be written as a function of the modulation frequency (ω), the non-radiative relaxation time (τ), the optical absorption coefficient (β), and sample thermal diffusivity (α_{s}) as [20,21]
with τ_{β} = 1/αβ^{2}. In Eq. (1), the first term corresponds to the non-radiative relaxation contribution, and it increases with increasing modulation frequency. However, the second term is the contribution from thermal diffusion in the optical-absorption depth. This contribution decreases as the modulation frequency increases. In this sense, if the experiments provide a condition of an optically opaque and thermally thick sample, in which both optical absorption depth and the thermal diffusion length are much smaller than the sample thickness, we can assume the phase delay of the photoacoustic signal as given by [21]
with ω = 2πf, in which f is the frequency of the modulated light excitation. The thermally thick and optically opaque regime can be verified by performing a frequency scanning at a fixed wavelength of an absorbing center of the pigment samples using the PAS setup. Thus, for a given absorber center, we can obtain the non-radiative relaxation time by
Considering a PA signal composed by superimposed bands S_{I} and S_{II}, with each band centered at two different wavelengths, λ_{I} and λ_{II}, each absorbing center will take different times to absorb and generate heat, presenting a signal with different phases ϕ_{I} and ϕ_{II} [10,11,14,22].
The phase-resolved photoacoustic method (PRPA), in turn, can detect different bands if a difference in phase (Δϕ = ϕ_{I} − ϕ_{II}) exists, working at a fixed frequency modulation. In this sense, the PA signal can be represented by a phasorial image, where it can be separated in two components (phase and quadrature), as can be seen in Fig. 1.
In a simplified way, a rotation operation can be executed, for example, on the S_{I} band (rotating ϕ_{I}), transforming S_{0}→S_{0^{′}} and S_{90}→S_{90^{′}}, i.e., the component S_{90^{′}} from the S_{I} band is zero. When the other band is projected onto the new axes, taking into account the component S_{90^{′}}, we have a new spectrum containing the signal generated by the bands that have phase differences with S_{I}, but without the contribution of this center [22,23] as
with
If the phase difference is Δϕ ≠ 0, it is possible to obtain the spectrum for each component, taking into account the experimental error in which the instrumental precision for the experimental measurement of the phase of a spectral component is less than 1°. On the other hand, it is usually assumed that for the photoacoustic spectrum generated by two absorber centers with very close peak centers, the delay of the measured phase must be greater than that of the instrumentation error. Therefore, the limit assumed here for the phase difference is defined as Δϕ > 3° [24].
Considering two absorbing center with phases delay assigned as ϕ_{I} and ϕ_{II}, and using Eq. (2), we can define
Using Eq. (7), we have the non-radiative relaxation time for each absorbing center given by
which leads to the non-radiative relaxation time difference between the absorbing centers as
In the case of these two absorbing centers having a difference of phase Δϕ > 3°, for a modulation frequency of 23 Hz, this difference need to be Δτ > 0.3 ms.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
After the pigment synthesis from the Pechini and SSR methods, the samples were characterized by XRD. The results from these analyses are presented in Fig. 2. We can observe the evolution of the crystalline phases with increasing x. Pigments LAFP-2, LAFP-4, LAFP-6, LAFP-8 [9], LAFRES-2, LAFRES-4, and LAFRES-6 presented a rhombohedral structure, with spatial group R-3c (perovskite). For LAFP, LAFRES-8, and LAFRES, phase crystalline transitions from rhombohedral to orthorombic are observed.
Lattice parameters and unit cell volumes obtained by refinement of peaks position by software XFIT and least square method by WINUNITCELL are shown in Table I. It was possible to observe a gradual growth in the lattice parameters as well as in the unit cell volume with the increase in Fe^{3+} ions content up to LAFRES-8 (for the SSR method) and LAFP (for the Pechini method). The distortions caused on perovskite structure can be attributed to the ionic radius differences between Fe^{3+} (0.785 Å) and Al^{3+} (0.675 Å) [9], in addition to the increase of the unity cell volume when Fe^{3+} replaces Al^{3+} on the B site.
On the other hand, the decrease on unity cell volume for the LAFRES-8, LAFRES, and LAFP systems can be related to the solubility of the Fe^{3+} ions in the systems LAFRES-8 and LAFRES due to the refractory property of LaAlO_{3} [25], which implies a mixture of the rhombohedric and orthorhombic crystalline phases. For the samples synthesized by the SSR method, secondary phases can be obtained (Al_{2}O_{3} and Fe_{2}O_{3}), which makes the proper phase identification difficult due to the peak diffraction superimposed on the LaAl_{1−x}Fe_{x}O_{3} phases.
Figure 3 shows the EPR signal for all LaAl_{1–x}Fe_{x}O_{3} samples at room temperature. The results demonstrate that LAFP samples have fewer Fe^{3+} ions contributing to the signal (mainly for LAFP-2 and LAFP-4), when compared to the samples with the same concentration obtained by the SSR method. For LAFRES-2 and LAFRES-4, for instance, the spectra consist mainly of an intense resonance signal at g ∼ 2. This resonance is characteristic of either octahedral Fe^{3+} and/or clusters of Fe^{3+} ions coupled by spin-spin interactions [26–29].
This behavior corroborates with a previous study on LAFP samples investigated by Mossbauer spectroscopy [9], in which LAFP-2 and LAFP-4 samples presented a single paramagnetic site referring to iron atoms substituting aluminum atoms in the perovskite lattice. The paramagnetic characteristic is justified due to the fact that there is no coupling of Fe atoms that are far apart in the crystalline structure. In this work, we attributed the EPR resonance for samples LAFRES-2 and LAFRES-4 to the same reason as for LAFP.
The EPR signal of LAFRES-6 is evidenced by a ferromagnetic behavior [30], which, in comparison with LAFP-6, results from the Mossbauer investigation [9], and there is a magnetic coupling. Yet, LAFRES-8, LAFRES, LAFP-8, and LAFP do not show an EPR signal at room temperature. It was not possible to relate the EPR behavior with Mossbauer spectroscopy of the SSR samples due to the presence of secondary phases, which reinforces the XRD results.
It is known that LAFRES is an antiferromagnetic insulator material [31–33], and therefore, it can be inferred that LAFRES-8 possesses the same antiferromagnetic insulator character at room temperature. Notwithstanding, increasing x clearly modifies the magnetic properties of LaAl_{1–x}Fe_{x}O_{3} pigments, because the increase in Fe^{3+} concentration can induce a super exchange interaction between particles with a very small magnetic moment. This is verified in materials with high concentration of Fe^{3+} [26,28].
A transformation from a rhombohedral structure into orthorhombic can also be identified. This is due to the larger distribution of iron atoms, substituting aluminum ones, occupying different positions in the two co-existing structures. The different magnetic neighborhoods imply a change from paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic behavior with increasing x.
Survey PAS UV-Vis spectra of LaAl_{1–x}Fe_{x}O_{3} pigments are presented in Fig. 4. By critically analyzing the Fe^{3+} electronic transitions present in octahedral sites, which are presented in the Appendix, the region of 250–400 nm can be attributed to ligand to metal charge-transfer (LMCT) transitions and partially from the contributions of Fe^{3+} ligand field transitions {6}A_{1}→^{4}T_{1}(^{4}P)(290−310nm),^{6}A_{1}→^{4}E(^{4}D), and {6}A_{1}→^{4}T_{2}(^{4}D)(340−380nm). The region 400–600 nm is considered to be the result of the pair excitation processes {6}A_{1}+^{6}A_{1}→^{4}T_{1}(^{4}G)+^{4}T_{1}(^{4}G). However, in this region, the ligand field transition {6}A_{1}→^{4}E,^{4}A_{1}(^{4}G) in ∼430 nm can be overlapped [34–37].
From the normalized PA signal, the following absorption bands are identified: 290nm(Pk1),340−350nm(Pk2),450nm(Pk3),480nm(Pk4), and 550 nm(Pk5). Note that when x increases, the amplitude of the bands attributed to the transitions Pk3, Pk4, and Pk5 increase. This behavior is typical of Fe^{3+} ions in perovskite structures and is related to the increase in the coupling degree of Fe^{3+}–Fe^{3+} [34].
To explore these results even further, the PRPA method was applied in the PAS spectra, with a lower limit set to Δϕ = Ψ > 3°. Table II summarizes the PRPA results, where the notation Ψ_{(a}_{−b}_{)} represents the phase difference between the Pk_{a} and Pk_{b} absorbing center. The set of samples prepared with the Pechini method (LAFP) did not show phase separation (results not presented here). This implies that these samples present only one of the Fe^{3+} configurations (octahedral Fe^{3+} or clusters of Fe^{3+} ions coupled by spin-spin interactions). On the other hand, LAFRES presents phase separation, showing the two conditions of Fe^{3+}. In addition, Pk_{1} and Pk_{2} (Ψ_{1–2}) have no phase difference, evidencing that the two absorbing centers possess approximately the same non-radiative relaxation time. For Pk_{3}, Pk_{4}, and Pk_{5} (Ψ_{3–5}, Ψ_{4–5}), a decrease is observed in phase difference with the increase of x up to the limit of Ψ < 3°. Considering that Pk_{5} (at 550 nm) is related to the magnetic coupling of Fe^{3+} neighbor ions, it can be inferred that this magnetic coupling influences the non-radiative relaxation time of this absorbing center. Figure 5(a) presents a typical PRPA for LAFRES-2, and Fig. 5(b) shows a typical result of non-separation for LAFP-2, as can be seen for the red line, which is approximately constant with the wavelength.
As the magnetic coupling of Fe^{3+} ions is dependent on the distance between Fe–Fe ions [34,35] in the matrix, it can be assumed that the non-radiative relaxation time of Fe^{3+} ions is indeed dependent on the Fe–Fe distance, and consequently, the PRPA method is sensitive to detection of this behavior. This can be verified by the relaxation times calculated using Eq. (3).
Frequency scanning, at fixed wavelengths, of a specific absorbing center of the pigments was performed to ensure the optically opaque sample in thermally thick regime measurements. Figure 6 presents the typical results obtained for the PA signal amplitude for frequency scanning (5–150 Hz). A f^{−1} curve dependence is also presented for comparison. Considering the frequency of 23 Hz used for PAS measurements and, according to Ref [38], using front incidence, a f^{−1} dependence is a thermally thick regime in an optically opaque regime. This behavior was tested for all samples in the absorbing centers assigned previously. Therefore, Eq. (3) can be used to estimate the non-radiative relaxation time. We determinate the non-radiative relaxation time difference using Eq. (8) for two consecutive absorbing centers.
Figure 7 presents the behavior of Δτ with x for each absorbing center obtained from Eq. (3). The error bar was obtained by propagating the experimental accuracy of 1° for ϕ and 0.2 Hz for the modulation frequency. The results are in agreement with the ones obtained from phase separation (shown in Table II). It can be noticed that the increasing Fe^{3+} content decreases the non-radiative relaxation times of Pk_{3}, Pk_{4}, and Pk_{5}, and these values tend to the ones of Pk_{1} and Pk_{2}. This explains the decrease of the phase separation due to the strong magnetic interaction of the Fe^{3+} ions for LAFRES. This result is reinforced also by the EPR measurements, indicating that with more vibrating ions, the magnetic coupling increases and that this property alters the non-radiative relaxation time. It should be emphasized that the values presented here are quantitative. However, the results do provide a qualitatively consistent behavior of Fe^{3+} concentration on the non-radiative relaxation time difference between the absorbing centers.
The results presented here show that the PA phase of a solid sample can provide valuable information about its structure, optical absorption, and non-radiative transitions, as predicted theoretically by Mandelis et_al [21] in 1979. In this investigation, it was possible to determine the behavior of the non-radiative decay of LaAl_{1−x}Fe_{x}O_{3} inorganic pigments and how the preparation method can have an influence on the neighborhood of Fe^{3+} ions. Because Fe^{3+} ions are transition metals and the energy levels are strongly influenced by the sites where they are distributed, we demonstrated that the PRPA method is sensitive to the structural variations of these sites.
IV. CONCLUSION
In this work, we characterized LaAl_{1–x}Fe_{x}O_{3} pigments obtained by means of two different methods: the Phase-Resolved Photoacoustic method and the EPR technique. The EPR results confirm the presence of Fe^{3+} ions with g = 2, which can be attributed to either octahedral Fe^{3+} and/or clusters of Fe^{3+} ions coupled by spin-spin interactions. With increasing x, the magnetic behavior changes from paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic. From the EPR results, we identify differences in the preparation methods. From the photoacoustic results, we assigned the optical absorption characteristics of Fe^{3+}, and from those results, applying the phase resolved photoacoustic method, we inferred the different sites of Fe^{3+}. We showed that it is possible to estimate the non-radiative relaxation time from the PRPA method, demonstrating the increase of the interaction spin-spin of Fe^{3+}. We also showed that the PRPA method is sensitive to the way that inorganic pigments are prepared.
APPENDIX: THEORY OF Fe^{3+} SPECTRA
There are three types of electronic transitions: (i) the Fe^{3+} ligand field transitions, (ii) the ligand to metal charge-transfer transitions, and (iii) those that result from the simultaneous excitation of magnetically coupled Fe^{3+} ions occupying adjacent sites.
(i) Fe^{3+}ligand field transitions: in octahedral coordination, the atomic orbitals of Fe are split in two sets of orbitals: t_{2g} and e_{g}. In the ligand field approximation, the energy of these states is expressed in terms of the Δ, B, and C parameters (Racah parameters). One example of the ligand states for the Fe^{3+} in octahedral coordination as a function of Δ/B is shown in Fig. 8.
The fundamental state ^{6}A_{1} comes from the ground state (t2gα){3}(e2gα){2} coordination of high spin Fe^{3+}. The first excited state is (t2gα){3}(egα){1}(t2gβ){1}. From this configuration, the ^{4}T_{1}_{g} and ^{4}T_{2}_{g} states arise. The configuration spin flip results in the next excited states, (t2gα){2}(egα){2}(t2gβ){1}. All transitions from ground state ^{6}A_{1} are, in principle, forbidden. However, in practice, these transitions can occur with a defined transition probability and are the origin of the strong color of Fe oxides [34,35]. These transitions become allowed or assisted through the magnetic coupling of electronic spins of next-nearest neighbor Fe^{3+} cations in the crystal structure. If two Fe^{3+} cations are strongly coupled, one must consider the spectroscopic selection rules for the Fe^{3+}–Fe^{3+} pairs, but not those individual Fe^{3+} ions, at the moment the covalence between Fe and O also plays an important role [34,40]. Considering two Fe^{3+} coupled, the Heisenberg Hamiltonian is
in which S_{a} and S_{b} are the electronic spins of the two Fe^{3+} cations and J is the Heisenberg exchange integral. Applying Eq. (A1) as a perturbation of the ligand field states of the uncoupled Fe^{3+} cations yields a set of states for the pair with energies, given by
Here, S is the net spin of the pair with values |S_{a}+S_{b}|,|S_{a}+S_{b}−1|,|….|,|S_{a}−S_{b}−1. If both Fe^{3+} cations are in their ground state, ^{6}A_{1}, S_{a} = S_{b} = 5/2, the resulting pair-states derived by coupling the two Fe^{3+} cations will have S = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Now, if one of the Fe^{3+} cations in the pair is excited to a quartet ligand state, S_{a} = 3/2 and S_{b} = 5/2, the two Fe^{3+} would couple to a set of five pair states with S = 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. Transition from the S = 1, 2, 3, and 4 states in the Fe^{3+}(^{6}A_{1g})−Fe^{3+}(^{6}A_{1g}) pair state to an excited single ion pair state can occur with |S_{a}−S_{b}=0| and be spin allowed.
(ii) Ligand to metal charge-transfer transitions: According to molecular orbital theory, the transitions at energy higher than the most of the ligand field transitions are the ligand to metal charge-transfer transitions (LMCTs). These bands are normally at the 230–260-nm region for Fe^{3+} octahedral coordination sites [34,35].
(iii) Pair excitation or double excitation process: An additional phenomenon resulting from the magnetic coupling of adjacent Fe^{3+} cations is the presence of absorption features corresponding to the simultaneous excitation of two Fe^{3+} centers. These features occur at energies given approximately by the sum of two single ion Fe^{3+} ligand field transitions and are often referred to as “double excitation processes.” These transitions are also spin allowed: if both Fe^{3+} cations are excited to a quartet ligand field state so that S_{a} = S_{b} = 3/2, the pair states resulting from coupling the two Fe^{3+} cations will have S values of 0, 1, 2, and 3, and the transitions to these pair states can occur [34,35].
