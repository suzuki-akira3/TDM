Description of nonideal Lorentz transformation for electromagnetic nulls
To identify characteristic topological features of the electromagnetic field in an arbitrary reference frame, Lorentz transformation properties of an electromagnetic field near a null point are explored under certain constraints, in different nonideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) situations for linear nulls, showing violations of topology accordingly. It is shown that Newcomb's condition for conservation of covariant magnetic surfaces does not necessarily mean conservation of field line topology under Lorentz transformation. Characterizations of the violation of magnetic topology under Lorentz transformation are given. A method describing local magnetic null webs by combination of the first and second order Taylor expansions is also proposed, whose transformation properties with possible nonideal influences are discussed in the frame of resistive MHD. These results are important for establishing a reasonable range of the fieldline picture and thus the dynamical analysis based on magnetic fieldlines.
I. INTRODUCTION
Ever since it was first proposed by Alfven [1,2], the magnetic field line has become a commonly accepted concept with which physical pictures of magnetic fields can be easily constructed. It plays a crucial role in the study of magnetic topology evolution as well as many magnetically dominated processes such as magnetic reconnection [3–5], dynamo [6], and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) turbulence [7]. Conservation properties of magnetic field lines have also been explored in the literature [8,9], identifying the domain of validity for this concept. Covariant representation of transported flow [10] as well as magnetic connectivity [11] has also been proposed to deal with relativistic problems. Under the constraint of idealness, magnetic topology is conserved under Lorentz transformation (LT) [9]. However, when nonideal effects exist, e.g., resistivity, Hall terms, and so on, not only can magnetic topology evolve with time but also change under LT. Due to the inconvenience in describing dynamic processes with covariant descriptions of the magnetic field and their inability to offer detailed information for null structures, magnetic field lines are widely employed in analysis and understanding of many phenomena in astrophysical as well as laboratory plasmas. The behavior of fieldlines and the change of magnetic topology due to nonidealness under LT are therefore worth looking into to show to what extent the fieldline represents the complete behavior of the electromagnetic (EM) field.
Nonideal effects, manifest as a finite electric field in the rest frame, distort conservation properties of the magnetic fieldlines as discussed in Ref [9]. The differences between the null structure in the rest frame and that in an arbitrary observer frame, in fact, can be seen as a mark for nonideal effects. However, as was pointed out in Ref [9], “the maximum transformation velocity up to which the topology does not change depends on the configuration under consideration, especially the configuration and value of the electric field.” In other words, a general quantitative measure is not accessible for nonideality induced change in fieldline topology. In general, with nonideal effects, features of magnetic fieldline complexity do not necessarily have the same representation in the rest and observer frames, i.e., links, including the trivial (disjointedly embedded circles) and the essential (not disjointedly embedded) [12], constituting the total helicity may be changed due to LT. For B=(x_{1}−2x_{2},x_{1}−x_{2},0) and E=(0,1,0) in the rest frame, there are trivial elliptical links which are static but do not survive after LT. And instead, helical structures emerge (see Fig. 1). Ultimately, it results from the fact that helicity and other higher order topological quantities are odd-dimensional [12–15], representing the invariants of coadjoint action of the volume-preserving group SDiff(M), while spacetime is however four-dimensional (4D). It requires careful treatment of Lorentz transformed magnetic fieldlines in the presence of nonideal effects, especially fieldlines around magnetic nulls. Though in practice, a frame can be chosen for simulation and theoretical analysis, plasmas containing extremely rapidly moving nulls cannot be nonrelativistically described in a single frame. The difference then emerges between the observed picture and that seen in the frame where fluid elements rest. In analysis of commonly seen nonideal magnetic nulls in a steady state, we can get certain qualitative or semi-quantitative results, to give a few measures for analyzing EM topology, which is then critical to understanding whether the fieldline picture offers good descriptions in different cases. Our discussions are focused on magnetic fieldlines in the vicinity of a magnetic null since away from magnetic null points, the magnetic fieldline topology is an ill-posed question unless the full length of a magnetic fieldline can be in principle followed [16].
To study characteristic topological properties of the EM field and their covariance under LT, particularly the signatures of the magnetic field lines in various reference frames, we in this paper further discuss the LT properties of electromagnetic nulls in the nonideal case, which may be applied in relativistic magnetic reconnection and related processes, especially in studies of astrophysical phenomena. The paper is organized as follows: Section II is devoted to the discussion on linear magnetic nulls under LT, where the nonideal electric field is represented by an expansion around the magnetic null, with the effect of constant and linear terms analyzed. Resistive MHD (rMHD) model is employed in Sec. III to analyze certain LT properties of local magnetic null webs. Section IV contains a discussion combining some invariant properties and fieldline topology in the presence of a nonideal electric field. And Sec. V serves as a brief summary. In this paper, discussions are focused on special relativity with LT between inertial frames, and natural units with the speed of light c =1 are adopted.
II. MUTUAL INFLUENCES OF ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC FIELDS BY LT
Focusing on magnetic configurations in the vicinity of a magnetic null point, our discussion is primarily constrained to constant and linear terms of the EM field. Let the field around the null r=0 in a rest frame be represented by E=E_{0}+∇E|{0}⋅r and B=∇B|{0}⋅r. In general, critical quantities of electric field are E=(E_{1},E_{2},E_{3}), ∂_{t}E=(∂_{t}E_{1},∂_{t}E_{2},∂_{t}E_{3}), and
regardless of its generation mechanism. A finite curl of the electric field in the rest frame surely imposes further difficulties such as simultaneity, which will not exist for steady configurations in the rest frame. Our discussion in this paper will be confined to the situation of a steady state in rest frame for the magnetic field with ∂_{t}B=−∇×E=0 and J=∇×B. Take V in the x_{1} direction, the LT-ed fields are
where the Lorentz factor γ=1/1−V^{2}. The LT-ed electric field usually composes of two parts, E′=E′_{ni}+E′_{in}, where E′_{ni} is transformed from the nonideal electric field E_{ni} and E′_{in} from the intrinsic electric field E_{in}(≈VX⋅Δx), i.e., the electric field that can be induced by LT of the magnetic field, with the intrinsic expansion matrix near the null point
Similarly, for the magnetic field, B′=B′_{LT}+B′_{Eni}, where B′_{LT} from B in the rest frame and B′_{Eni} from E_{ni}.
First, to describe the effect of E_{ni} on LT of magnetic nulls, emphasis should be on the following features. (1) To the same magnetic field, the separation of the ideal from the nonideal case can be estimated by defining a separation parameter. For a given starting point, say a point close to the null, (x^{′}_{1}(0),x^{′}_{2}(0),x^{′}_{3}(0)) in the LT-ed frame, trace the magnetic field lines and let it be parameterized by the length s, dx_{1}B_{1}=dx_{2}B_{2}=dx_{3}B_{3}=ds|B|, and then X^{′}_{i}=(x^{′}_{i1}(s),x^{′}_{i2}(s),x^{′}_{i3}(s)) is the location for the ideally transformed fieldline at the length s. If X^{′}_{ni}=(x^{′}_{ni1}(s),x^{′}_{ni2}(s),x^{′}_{ni3}(s)) is the location in the presence of the nonideal electric field, we then can define a parameter Δ=|X^{′}_{i}−X^{′}_{ni}|. Comparing Δ with the critical scale for a specific problem shows whether the LT of relativistic flows has significant influences on the physical picture. (2) Angles between E^{′} and B^{′} on a spacetime point can be given by cosθ^{′}=E^{′}⋅B^{′}|E^{′}||B^{′}|. Thus, with the numerator is a Lorentz invariant and the denominator is not, only right angles conserve under LT. A ratio R_{EB}=θ/θ^{′}=(E,B)/(E^{′},B^{′})=arccosE⋅B|E||B|/arccosE⋅B|E′||B′| can be defined to depict the magnitude of the change, which is determined by both the EM field configuration and V. (3) Angles between eigenvectors of an electric or magnetic null in the rest and the observer frames can also be compared to estimate the change of topology. (4) The variation of null types, more drastic than the change of angles, is of great importance, among which the change of dimensionality is the most serious and always appears. (5) The shift of null locations can be taken as a representation for E_{ni}. (6) Symmetry breaking caused by E_{ni}, on the other hand, is an obvious indicator with asymmetries generated both by LT of B and superposition of B′_{Eni}, The former is along V and exists in the ideal situation.
Second, different groups of E_{ni} can be distinguished as (I) the highly localized, (II) the constant in the region of the linear B field, (III) the linear in the region considered, and (IV) those consisting of both the constant and the linear terms.
Case (I) is similar to situations where the diffusion region (DR) is small with E_{ni} only at the immediately neighborhood of the magnetic neutral point, thus E⋅B=0 satisfied elsewhere. Then approximately E_{ni}=(E_{1}δ(r),E_{2}δ(r),E_{3}δ(r)). It may result from a large amount of electric charge confined in an infinitesimal region caused by a certain type of charge or current singularity. Nevertheless, this kind of E_{ni} does not affect the LT of B nor E′_{in} in terms of global topology due to the strong locality. On the other hand however, the connectivity of fieldlines is certainly affected.
Case (II) has a constant electric field in the vicinity of the null. This can be found in a steady state electric field in the area produced in reconnection processes particularly in rMHD, especially where the dissipation of magnetic energy leads to intense pair production and renders the plasma highly collisional [17]. In this case, there is an electric potential formed, which can accelerate the bulk plasma. Quantities in the rest frame can be written as E_{0}=(E_{1},E_{2},E_{3}), B=∇B⋅r, and ∇E=0; and after LT, ∂_t^{′}B^{′}=∂_t^{′}E^{′}=0, B^{′}=(0,γVE_{3},−γVE_{2})+∇^{′}B^{′}⋅r^{′}, and E^{′}=(E_{1},γE_{2},γE_{3})+∇^{′}E^{′}⋅r^{′}. It shows that by the transformation, the position of the magnetic null is shifted unless E_{0} is completely parallel to V, while the bifurcation structure is preserved but moved. The strength of E_{ni} determines the shift distance, measured by the relative strength of |B^{′}| and |∇^{′}B^{′}|. Let L be the spatial scale characterizing the first order expansion, then the effect of a constant E_{ni} on the magnetic field, say the topology change and the position shift, can be only seen as a perturbation if C_{B}=|B^{′}|L|∇^{′}B^{′}|∼VE_{⊥}L∇B_{⊥}≪1. Oppositely if C_{B}≫1, B^{′}_{Eni} would become dominant after LT, while B^{′}_{LT} becomes a perturbation. However, this is not likely to occur for a magnetofluid, but common for electrostatic cases. An external electric potential can also lead to such kind of situation. For the LT of E^{′}, the analysis is similar, with the criterion changed to C_{E}=|E^{′}|L|∇^{′}E^{′}|∼E_{⊥}LV∇B_{⊥}. For a given C^{′}_{E}=E_{⊥}L∇B_{⊥}, since 0≤V≤1, situations can be divided into 3 groups.
(II.1) C^{′}_{E}∼1, for a nonrelativistic V, C_{B}≪1, and C_{E}≫1, then the magnetic and electric fields are mutually perturbations after LT, while for extreme relativistic cases however, C_{B}∼C_{E}∼1, and the correction of E_{ni} to E^{′} and B^{′} is both comparable to the magnetic induced quantities, demanding detailed consideration for specific cases.
(II.2) For C^{′}_{E}≫1, clearly C_{E}≫1 also holds. E^{′}_{B} can then be neglected in E^{′}. While for B^{′}, only when 0≤V≤εC^{′}E−1 can B^{′}_{Eni} be neglected, where ε is infinitesimal. As to V∼C^{′}E−1, B^{′}_{LT} and B^{′}_{Eni} comparably contribute to B^{′}. When V≫C^{′}E−1, B^{′} mainly results from E_{ni}.
(II.3) For C^{′}_{E}≪1, mutual effects of B and E are just the inverse of (2). Cases with C_{B}∼1 or C_{E}∼1 show combined effects of B and E_{ni} in LT, which can be explored in detail in the view of particular magnetic fields. The null location is then given by
And with the fixed direction of V, the displacement is linearly related to the magnitude of V. In the direction of fastest varying |∇B|, the shift is comparably small. For E_{ni} contributing a parallel component to the magnetic null line, the line will vanish after the transformation. The variation of null types can also result from a constant E_{ni}, i.e., 2D hyperbola or elliptic magnetic field lines will change into 3D spiral lines if E_{ni} is neither parallel to B nor to V. See Fig. 2. A clear example is a 2D magnetic field in rMHD, B=[a_{11}x+a_{12}y,a_{21}x−a_{11}y,0], where the electric field induced by the ohmic electric current is always perpendicular to the magnetic field, satisfying E⋅B=0. Thus points in the region with B^{2}−E^{2}=(a11x+a12y){2}+(a21x−a11y){2}−η^{2}(a21−a12){2}<0 can be LT-ed into magnetic nulls and the region is usually quite small due to tiny resistivity. Also, it should be pointed out that for rMHD, under the previously stated steady state assumption, E=ηJ in the rest frame shows that the potential null configuration is not only free from reconnection but also conserves topology between different reference frames.
Case (III) manifests complexity, with no E_{ni} but finite ∇E at the magnetic null point, when E_{ni} induces an unignorable B^{′}_{Eni} by LT. Transformations of corresponding quantities are given as (1). For stationary cases considered, ∇×E_{ni}=0, requiring X=∇E|{0} to be symmetric and only magnetic nulls with a curl-free current can satisfy this condition in rMHD. In this case, the electric field also induces a potential, whose gradient, i.e., the electric field, is not homogeneous. Therefore, the potential of the linear electric field leads to acceleration in different directions with various strengths. The quasi-neutral condition for plasmas in the rest frame can be written as ∇⋅E=0, i.e., e_{11}+e_{22}+e_{33}=0. As a matter of fact, for rMHD with constant resistivity, if the electric field in the rest frame is steady, i.e., ∂_{t}E=0, then ∇⋅E=∇⋅(ηJ)=η∇⋅(∇×B)=0. Under these constraints, the structure of electric nulls in the rest frame can only be that identical to potential magnetic neutral points. In nonneutral cases, possible electric nulls are superpositions of potential nulls and charge contributions. The rank of the matrix M=∇^{′}B^{′} might change due to E_{ni}. For 3D magnetic nulls, let h(V)=aV^{2}+bV+c=0, where
and c=|M|. For 0≤V≤1, the dimension of B can be reduced for V satisfying by h(V)=0. And h(0)×h(1)=(a+b+c)×c<0 guarantees the existence of V which changes the dimension of magnetic null structure. For 3D magnetic nulls reducible to 2D ones in a specific frame, convenience for analysis may be obtained in that frame. Not as drastic as the change of dimension, the change of magnetic null types can be discussed by eigenvalues, which before and after LT are given by
respectively, whose 1st order derivatives with respect to λ are f^{(1)}(λ) and g^{(1)}(λ), showing properties of the roots. Let Δ=a_{23}a_{32}+a_{13}a_{31}+a_{12}a_{21}−a_{11}a_{22}−a_{22}a_{33}−a_{11}a_{33}, the sign of Δ shall be decided to see the possible distribution of real roots. The change of Δ then indicates change of magnetic topology. For Δ>0, the roots λ_{±} for f^{(1)}(λ)=0 are critical in deciding the number of real roots by the sign of f(λ_{−}), while the number of positive roots is decided by f(0)=|M|. Ratios of eigenvalues usually do not conserve in the presence of E_{ni}, unless the corresponding coefficients of f(λ) and g(λ) are proportional to each other. By a detailed investigation, it can be seen that magnetic nulls with an eigenvalue 0 or two identical real roots are unstable even with a minor E_{ni}. In other words, under the transformation, the higher the system symmetry is, the less stability the system will have. There are two ways to estimate the change of magnetic topology. (1) |f(λ_{−})| and |f(0)| determine the sensibility of the magnetic null structure to the perturbation E_{ni}. The larger they are, the more stable the magnetic null structure is. (2) Quantitative estimates can also be made. Let
we can define
Deviation of r from unity indicates the change of the magnitude ratios of eigenvalues by the transformation. For cases where A/C≪1, B/C≪1, D/F≪1, E/F≪1, magnetic null structures are stable. It can be achieved for situations with large C and F. Electric configurations with A=B=D=E=0 then do not affect the topology of B. For each magnetic null configuration, direct computation shows that there will always be a possible linear electric null in the rest frame that does not affect the magnetic structure by LT. However, they may not always happen to be the real situation. The influence of B on E by LT can be analyzed using similar methods and dual quantities.
A special case should be mentioned where E⋅B=0 holds on every spacetime point, where each point with B^{2}−E^{2}>0 is a magnetic null in its own rest frame, requiring (∇E⋅r)⋅(∇B⋅r)=0. It is the condition for conservation of covariant magnetic surfaces [8]. Define a matrix
and a vector e=(e_{11},e_{22},e_{33},e_{12},e_{13},e_{23}). The solution H⋅e=0 gives possible E_{ni} s, i.e., for a magnetic null to have corresponding linear electric nulls satisfying E⋅B=0, detH=0 should hold. By direct calculation, it is only possible for the 2D magnetic null. Therefore 2D nulls are especially easy to change under LT except for special situations of potential nulls or where E_{ni} does not affect the transformation of B. Thus, the conservation of covariant magnetic surfaces does not mean the conservation of magnetic fieldlines in different frames (see Fig. 3). Barotropic Hall MHD with the electric field E∝J×B can take on this form in the case of linear magnetic null. As a matter of fact, a relativistic force-free field where ρE+J×B=0 [18] always satisfies this degeneracy condition, which can be seen by taking the dot product with B. Though conserving covariant magnetic surfaces, the evolution of force-free fields does not mean a conserved fieldline topology when changing frames.
Case (IV) is possibly realized in real scenarios and much more complex. For E_{ni} decreasing outwards from the magnetic null, there may be some resemblance to the diffusion region in magnetic reconnection. In this case, the number of magnetic nulls may reduce under LT, which never appears in the pure linear case. It depends on the solvability of (E1,γE2,γE3){T}=−T2−1γXT_{2}⋅r, where T_{2}≡[γ00010001], in the range 0≤V≤1 that whether there is still any magnetic null after LT. Similarly, an electric null point can be studied by (0,γVE3,−γVE2){T}=−T2−1γMT_{2}⋅r. Qualitatively speaking, seen from the observer frame, the dominant role of nonideality changes from the constant to the linear part gradually with an increasing distance to the null, i.e., to make a transition from Case (II) to Case (III) (see Fig. 4).
To sum up, in the presence of E_{ni}, main features of LT properties for magnetic nulls are as follows. (i) The type of the magnetic null structure can change in general, with the change of dimensionality as the most extreme case. (ii) The influence of E_{ni} on the magnetic null structure in LT mainly depends on the stability of the magnetic null structure, the structure and relative strength of E_{ni}, and the direction and magnitude of V. (iii) The constant term of E_{ni} can shift the location of the magnetic null as be LT-ed. (iv) A linear E_{ni} does not affect the number of discrete magnetic nulls, though continuous null structures, say a null line or a neutral sheet, may however be totally changed. (v) Although magnetic fieldlines can be plotted in any frame, no correspondence exists for magnetic fieldlines before and after LT as long as E_{ni} plays a role.
III. LT PROPERTIES OF LOCAL MAGNETIC NULL WEBS
Section II is focused on the LT property of discrete magnetic nulls. However, in magnetic reconnection [19–21] such as that in magnetosphere and solar plasmas, as well as in other large scale structures of magnetic configurations [22–25], the web of discrete magnetic nulls certainly plays a significant role. Some commonly studied cases manifest complicated features by LT, i.e., the stretch-twist-fold (STF) flow [26], which is most conducive to fast dynamo, takes a form of combination of linear and second order terms, e.g.,
The STF flow has an associated electric current j=(−βx,2α,30x) with a finite curl, indicating that for rMHD this kind of flow is time-varying, and therefore quite distinct in different reference frames, with a relativistic velocity.
In this section, we explore local magnetic null webs using the Taylor expansion method up to the second order, and assuming the third and higher order terms negligible. In the rest frame, the magnetic field in the vicinity of a given null is
The general quadratic form near the null is then
With ∇⋅B=0, constraints on expansion coefficients are
From the expression, in the immediate neighborhood of a magnetic null where the expansion holds, the second order contribution gives a nonlinear correction to the first order, with the linear part dominating most of the inner region around the null while the second order part playing a role on a larger scale. The second order contribution can then make a significant difference where the first order vanishes, i.e., on null lines and neutral planes. Such kinds of magnetic field can have many interesting mathematical features, e.g., dynamics on center manifold [27], stable closed orbits, and trans-adiabatic drifts between different invariant surfaces [26], which deserve further investigation.
The number of nearby discrete null points described by the expansion reduces to a mathematical problem of finding common real roots of the polynomials
This can be handled by the resultant method via the construction of Bezout matrix [26], i.e., let F_{x}=R_{x}(g,h), F_{y}=R_{x}(h,f), F_{z}=R_{x}(f,g), and G_{x}=R_{y}(F_{y},F_{z}), G_{y}=R_{y}(F_{x},F_{z}), G_{z}=R_{y}(F_{x},F_{y}), and solve the G_{i}=0 and F_{i}=0 successively, where R_{i}(F_{1},F_{2}) denotes the resultant of polynomials of F_{1} and F_{2} with respect to the subscript i. From the theory of polynomials, we can easily see that the above expressions can possess at most 8 separate common real roots, i.e., 8 separate null points. This is deduced by Bezout's bound, .i.e., the number of common zeros is at most N=∏n_{i}, where n_{i} is the highest order of the ith polynomial. The connection between different nulls, with the structure of the electric current the main feature, can be deduced from the expression also
In rMHD for the steady state ∂_{t}E=0, the nonideal electric field in the rest frame is E=ηJ, which in this case contains both constant and linear terms, no longer always static as that in the pure linear case. The transformation rules are as before. With the effect of the nonideal electric field, the roots for the polynomials are likely to change, which represents topological changes of the magnetic field. Due to the great variety of the structure with the second order term [29,30], we do not enumerate all possible local magnetic nulls but show some typical examples.
For the magnetic null given by B={y(y−a)−z(z−a)x(x−a)+z(z−a)−x(x−a)+y(y−a), the local null web consists of 8 separate null points, with 4 couples (0,0,0), (a,a,a); (0,a,a), (a,0,0); (a,0,a), (0,a,0); and (0,0,a), (a,a,0). The null points in each couple have completely contrary eigenvalues to the first order, which is consistent with the observation of clustered magnetic nulls [31]. The nonideal electric field therefore is E_{ni}=2η(y−z,x−z,x−y). The Lorentz transformed magnetic field in the x_{1} direction with the velocity V is then
Let b=2Vη, the nulls depicted by the original coordinate are (0,0,0), (a,a,a); (a−b,0,0), (−b,a,a); and 12(a−b±a^{2}+b^{2},a+b+a^{2}+b^{2},a−b−a^{2}+b^{2}), 12(a−b±a^{2}+b^{2},a+b−a^{2}+b^{2},a−b+a^{2}+b^{2}). Clearly, from the condition E(0,0,0)=E(a,a,a)=0, the first pair of nulls survives under whatever LT, while the other nulls will however change. Particularly, for b=a or b=−a, there are only 7 null points, with two former 3D nulls merging into a 2D one. Just as proposed in Ref [19], the points with E⋅B=0 are likely to change into magnetic nulls by an LT. See Fig. 5. For a large a, since resistivity is always small, the number of nulls can conserve under an LT. And the topological change of each separate null in the web can be investigated as in Sec. II.
It should be noted that for a 3D local null web with 3D second order terms, the nonideal electric field induced by constant resistivity cannot change it into 2D totally. However for a given null in the web, the change from 3D to 2D can sometimes occur. The 2D magnetic null webs, on the other hand however, are quite susceptible to nonideal effects, with unstable continuous null structures. For example, to B=[y(y−a)−z(z−a),x(x−a)−z(z−a),0], the resistivity induced nonideal electric field is E=ηV(2z−a,−2z+a,2x−2y), an infinitesimal LT will change it into a null web with only 2 discrete nulls. See Fig. 6. Thus 3D magnetic nulls shall certainly be more commonly seen in observation than 2D ones. Similar to a single null, only potential null webs which can be constructed from potential nulls of the first and second orders [28,29,31,32] can well retain their topological properties under an LT.
IV. COVARIANT VIEW OF THE NULL STRUCTURES
As described in Sections II and III, the magnetic field line topology is liable to change under LT, and the change of dimensionality seems drastic at first sight. However, though field lines may be susceptible to a frame transformation, the invariant regions in spacetime can give a covariant view to the magnetic structure. As proposed in Ref [18], invariants I_{1}=B^{2}−E^{2} and I_{2}=E⋅B can be employed to characterize a null point, and points with I_{1}<0 and I_{2}=0 are possible to change into nulls in certain reference frames. Here we take a step further and define the region with such properties as the null region. No matter what the spacetime decomposition is, a null region shall always be the region near a null spatially in any frame, and its size depends on the magnitude of nonideal effects and its shape on the properties of the EM field. Connections exist between the properties of the null region and the properties of the magnetic field line configuration.
First, it is obvious that dimensionality of the magnetic field lines can be clearly seen from a null region. The null region for 3D magnetic nulls in spacetime is 3D, e.g., in the rest frame, it is 2 spatial and 1 temporal. The spatial part is a bounded 2D surface, while in the temporal direction it is infinitely long for the steady state case. For 2D nulls, the null region turns out to be 4D and extend infinitely in 2 directions; therefore, no matter what the spacetime decomposition is, the observer will see the null region infinite in a spatial direction in an arbitrary instant. The identification of dimensionality is closely related to the identification of emergence and annihilation of null points, and therefore important.
On the other hand, the shape of a null region is related to the nonideal electric field. In rMHD with a constant electric field for linear magnetic nulls, the null region is in a plane spatially, while for nonideal electric field with non-constant term, it is on an irregular surface instead. In fact, the more complex the nonideal electric field is, the more irregular the null region will be.
Also, relative to the plasma, a null point can be defined invariantly and uniquely by the magnetic 4-vector b^{μ}=U^{μ∗}F_{μν} [33], with U^{μ} the 4-velocity of the plasma flow and ^{∗}F_{μν} the dual of the EM tensor. This kind of definition is relevant to the motion of plasmas, while the null region is defined independent of any velocity. In a given frame, b^{μ}=γ(v⋅B,B−v×E), which equals to (γvB_{||0},γB_{||0}+B_{⊥0}) where the subscript “0” represents the quantity being measured in the rest frame. Obviously, the LT property of the topology of b^{μ} is not the same as that for B, and thus has no line-preserving property. This is why it is ineffective to describe magnetic field lines. However, for the identification of the null point relevant to the plasma flow, this covariant vector is certainly useful. The physical importance of the null point with regard to the plasma flow is that it characterizes the diamagnetic property of the charged particles. For b^{μ}=0, electrons and ions are surely demagnetized. It can be seen that combining the covariant point of view and fieldline dynamics gives better understanding of the EM field in the relativistic regime.
V. CONCLUSIONS AND REMARKS
The presence of a nonideal electric field can affect the properties of magnetic fieldlines under LT. In this paper, the effects of the nonideal electric field are investigated both for separate linear magnetic nulls and local magnetic null web described by first and second order Taylor expansion terms. Certain major conclusions are reached as follows:
(1) In the presence of a nonideal electric field in the rest frame, magnetic and electric field configurations seen in the observer frame will show deviations. The intensity of the topology change depends on V, as well as the configuration and relative strengths of E_{ni} and B. For most cases, the nonideality adds to the complexity of the LT of the EM field.
(2) Topology violation includes situations where null types are changed or conserved. In both situations, magnetic fieldlines seen in the observer frame cannot be mapped to that in the rest frame. A finite electric field at the null point will change the null location after an LT. In general, the number of discrete magnetic nulls does not change with linear or constant electric corrections, and quantitative measures for topological change are given in both circumstances.
(3) For local magnetic null webs, the nonideal electric field can change the number of separate nulls in the web as well as the null type and location of each separate null. In the rMHD regime, 3D magnetic null webs are comparatively stable, and the number of nulls can be well preserved if the second order term is relatively smaller than the first order, while 2D null webs are always susceptible to nonideal effects with continuous null structure disappearing after LT, giving part of the reason for the ubiquitous existence of 3D nulls in observation.
However, though LT properties of steady state magnetic field lines can be analyzed, that of evolving fieldlines certainly impose difficulties concerning simultaneity, which should be explored in future work. The change of magnetic fieldlines structures due to LT make it worth deliberately analyzing the dynamics and energy conversion processes using pictures based on magnetic fieldlines such as kink modes or Fermi acceleration [34–37] in a fixed frame. To give a representation that can both be invariant under an LT and describe dynamics of EM fields, some new perspectives shall also be further explored. This work, however, should be helpful for observations, especially for magnetic reconnection with highly relativistic velocity, and be useful to the analysis of fieldlines in moving frames.
