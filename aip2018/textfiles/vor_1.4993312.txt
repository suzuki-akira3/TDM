Design and development of a low cost, high current density power supply for streamer free atmospheric pressure DBD plasma generation in air
This paper presents a new power supply architecture for generating a uniform dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma in air medium at atmospheric pressure. It is quite a challenge to generate atmospheric pressure uniform glow discharge plasma, especially in air. This is because air plasma needs very high voltage for initiation of discharge. If the high voltage is used along with high current density, it leads to the formation of streamers, which is undesirable for most applications like textile treatment, etc. Researchers have tried to generate high-density plasma using a RF source, nanosecond pulsed DC source, and medium frequency AC source. However, these solutions suffer from low current discharge and low efficiency due to the addition of an external resistor to control the discharge current. Moreover, they are relatively costly and bulky. This paper presents a new power supply configuration which is very compact and generates high average density (∼0.28 W/cm^{2}) uniform glow DBD plasma in air at atmospheric pressure. The efficiency is also higher as no external resistor is required to control the discharge current. An inherent feature of this topology is that it can drive higher current oscillations (∼50 A peak and 2–3 MHz frequency) into the plasma that damp out due to the plasma dissipation only. A newly proposed model has been used with experimental validation in this paper. Simulations and experimental validation of the proposed topology are included. Also, the application of the generated plasma for polymer film treatment is demonstrated.
I. INTRODUCTION
Plasma is considered the 4th state of matter, which is a highly active state. The whole universe is comprised of plasma state except planets and their satellites. All interstellar bodies, including the Sun in our solar system, are in the plasma state. We experience cold as well as thermal plasma in various applications like fluorescent tubes, plasma arc welding, plasma cutting, etc.
The plasma discharge is an efficient and environmentally friendly technique for functionality improvement (an improvement in surface energy that enhances wettability, etc.) in various surface engineering applications. The dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma is one such plasma discharge widely used for the surface treatment in many surface engineering applications such as textiles and polyethylene surface treatment. The DBD plasma generates active species (polar groups like COO^{−} and COOH^{−}) in the presence of oxygen that deposit on the surface of the material in radical form and etch the surface to improve the functionality [1]. This has been explored for many applications such as surface modifications and [2] biomedical applications [3].
Plasma density plays an important role in the fast processing of the surface by achieving the desired functionality improvement particularly for in-line treatment of textile, paper, and polymer film. High power density plasma is important for commercial applications as it can generate more active species that play a key role in fast surface functionality improvement without changing the bulk property of the material. This can provide a solution for in-line treatment of material in the industries.
DBD plasma can be generated with better homogeneity and density using gases like helium and argon, but the cost of these treatment gases is exorbitantly high and therefore does not make it an economically viable solution for industrial applications. Hence, DBD plasma generation, particularly in air with high density, can provide an economically viable solution.
In the past, numerous electrical models have been proposed to explain dielectric barrier discharge plasma at atmospheric pressure [4,5]. In most of these models, the filamentary discharges are represented by a voltage-controlled current source and have been experimentally validated. The general model representing filamentary discharge is shown in Fig. 1. In this model, the air gap capacitor is represented as C_{ag}, plasma discharge is represented as R_{p}, while the dielectric barrier capacitance is represented as C_{ds}. VCCS represents voltage-controlled current source whose amplitude depends upon the air gap voltage. However, filamentary discharge is undesirable in many applications and hence there is a need to work on power supply control to generate uniform glow discharge plasma. Another model has been presented to describe uniform glow discharge plasma based on input energy control by providing damping [6].
In this paper, the emphasis is on generating uniform glow discharge cold plasma in air for various surface engineering applications such as textiles and polyethylene surface treatment. Due to safety concerns, high-density cold plasma is preferred over plasma jets for applications like textile, paper, etc. OAUGDP (One Atmosphere Uniform Glow Discharge Plasma) is observed to be a safe treatment method for textile applications [4]. The plasma jet generates non-equilibrium streamers that are also cold plasma with high density but it can lead to arc formation and hence are not applicable for applications like textile, paper treatment, etc. Hence, high power density uniform glow discharge plasma has great potential in textile treatment as it can replace toxic chemical processes in textile industries.
Townsend has described the voltage-current transition from dark discharge to glow discharge and then arc discharge with the increase in discharge current as shown in Fig. 2. For glow discharge ionization in air at atmospheric pressure, the typical electric field of 30 kV/cm is required due to the higher ionization potential of air. However, at the higher voltage in air, a much faster transition from dark discharge to streamers (or arc) occurs, compared to low-pressure discharges.
The DBD load characteristics also depend on electrodes’ geometry and the dielectric material properties. The choice of thin dielectric material to get more discharge current leads to streamers’ formation at higher voltages, whereas thick dielectric requires higher voltage for discharge initiation, thereby restricting the current to a very low value [11–13].
No dynamic model, particularly for atmospheric pressure in air, has been able to predict the transition from dark discharge to arc discharge for a certain voltage and medium. However, various studies have been performed to understand the transition from corona to glow or streamer regimes. Researchers have observed the transition dynamics from dark discharge to arc discharge using a fast charged coupled camera or high-speed photo-sensors. It has been identified that streamers, in high voltage low current DBD, last for nearly 50–100 ns [14–16]. One of the techniques to avoid such streamers is to make the power available to plasma for few nanoseconds in the repetitive mode using an appropriate power supply. The use of medium frequency (10–100 kHz) AC supplies (5–30 kV) has also been reported for generation of air DBD plasma in surface engineering applications [17–20]. However, these topologies are required to generate very high voltages and generate random micro-discharge or streamers that are not good for textile and paper treatment.
The use of very high voltage (>20 kV) and nanosecond range (50–400 ns) pulsed supplies for DBD plasma generation has been reported for various surface engineering applications [21–25] with a repetition rate of 1–100 kHz. In nanosecond pulse discharge, applied energy to DBD plasma damps out in few microseconds after each pulse. Hence, nanosecond pulses help in limiting the discharge transition from glow to arc discharge. The nanosecond pulsed DBD plasma discharge is found to be homogenous as compared to DBD generation powered by 10–100 kHz AC sources [26–28]. However, even though such high voltage nanosecond pulses results in uniform plasma discharge for DBD applications, the achievable discharge current is limited to few hundred milliamperes only. This limits the achievable plasma density for DBD application. These nanosecond pulsed power supplies are not compact in size and less attractive for commercial purpose owing to their complexities and not been able to run several DBD discharge in parallel as an array for fast treatment. Various power supply topologies have been studied for generating homogenous plasma for DBD applications [29–31].
Huiskamp et_al [30] have worked on similar voltage-current characteristics for generating a plasma jet in paper printers using a DC voltage source as shown in Fig. 3. However, the oscillations across the plasma jet were generated due to parasitic capacitors of a MOSFET and diode D. The use of an external resistance R_{d} for controlling the plasma current dissipates a large amount of power and also it restricts the plasma current within a few milli-ampere range as shown in Fig. 4.
In this paper, a novel power supply architecture is proposed for generating high-density air plasma at atmospheric pressure using simulations and is implemented successfully in hardware. In this configuration, a relatively low voltage (<5 kV) is required as compared to high voltage nanosecond pulsed DC and yet it is capable of generating substantially high current (>50 A) and high-frequency oscillations (2–3 MHz) for DBD plasma formation.
These oscillations get damp through plasma resistance only and no external current limiting resistor is required to control the current. The repetition rate of high-frequency oscillations can be up to a maximum 100 kHz as plasma quenches each time within 10 μs. The high peak current (>50 A) generates more active species in the plasma and hence it helps in increasing the plasma density. The low voltage requirement also makes the system robust, compact, and economically viable. This power supply has been used to generate uniform glow discharge plasma in air at atmospheric pressure with an average power density of 0.28 W/cm^{2} across a 2 mm gap that is significantly high for surface engineering applications.
The remaining of this paper is divided as follows. Section II describes the proposed configuration for generating DBD plasma discharge. Section III presents the analysis of the proposed power supply architecture. Section IV includes the MATLAB simulation results of the proposed configuration. Section V describes the experimental results and validation of simulation results. Section VI presents the major conclusions with the application of the generated plasma on a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film.
II. PROPOSED POWER SUPPLY CONFIGURATION FOR DBD PLASMA GENERATION
Generalized DBD plasma model is represented by an air gap capacitor in series with a dielectric capacitor. The dielectric capacitor exists because of the dielectric layer between the electrodes. A resistor is included to represent power dissipation components of the plasma. These are the lumped parameters that depend upon the DBD load configurations. In this paper, the DBD load comprises a 2 mm air gap capacitor C_{g}, 100-μm dielectric film capacitance C_{d}, stray inductance due to mesh electrode L_{s}, and energy dissipating component R_{plasma} as shown in the electrical equivalent circuit in Fig. 5.
The objective of the proposed power supply architecture is to provide damping energy along with plasma generation in repetitive mode at high frequency to ensure streamer free discharge. The pulse duration of this discharge is 100–300 ns but at substantially lower voltage, i.e., less than 5 kV.
Radio frequency (2–3 MHz) oscillations can provide the desired 100–300 ns quarter pulses and also ensure the ion entrapment in the gap due to polarity reversal. However, conventional RF supply cannot be used as it is required to generate RF at a substantially high voltage of the order of a few kV especially for air medium that can generate Electro Magnetic Interference (EMI) problems in other instruments and which is also occupationally unsafe.
C_{d} is a physical parameter of 25–50 nF that is too large for governing resonance frequency of around 3 MHz and hence C_{p} is identified as 1–3 nF for series resonance with L_{s} of nearly 5 μH. With the maximum stored energy in C_{p} at 4000 V, the current oscillations’ amplitude is found to be balancing the energy in the tank circuit ½ CV^{2} = ½ LI^{2} which comes around 90 A. Capacitor C_{p} is switched through a high voltage switching unit that generates 1–3 MHz oscillations in the tank circuit. Plasma resistance can dissipate this energy in a few microseconds.
Stray inductance L_{s} due to micro-mesh electrodes plays an important role in building up the high voltage (∼6 kV) to initiate plasma discharge in the air gap. At the time of plasma discharge, reactive impedance of C_{g} is very high as compared to plasma resistance and hence the discharge network comprises stray component L_{s}, dielectric capacitor C_{d}, power source capacitor C_{p}, and plasma resistance R_{plasma}. Further, a DC blocking capacitor C_{b} is connected in series to the DBD plasma load. The analysis of this network comprising C_{p}, C_{b}, C_{d}, L_{s}, and R_{plasma} leads to
The damping coefficient ξ should be much less than unity to achieve underdamped high-frequency oscillations. This also provides reversal of polarity and ensures streamer free discharge. This damping subsequently reduces the energy coupled to plasma till it extinguishes and therefore it avoids the formation of streamers/arcs. The condition for underdamping also implies that C_{p} should be much lower than L_{s}. For L_{s} = 2–5 μH and C_{p} = 3 nF, natural oscillation frequency is 1–3 MHz with damping coefficient ξ ≪ 1.
Therefore, power supply configuration is such that it uses a step up transformer to generate a high voltage (3-4 kV) at 50 Hz that is directly connected to the network shown in Fig. 5 through a high voltage switching unit comprising a rotary arc switch.
III. ANALYSIS OF PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE
The operation and analysis of the proposed scheme can be divided into three modes denoted as mode1, mode 2, and mode 3. These modes of operations are explained next.Mode 1
As shown in Fig. 6(a), the high voltage step-up transformer charges the capacitor C_{1} while the high voltage switching unit is inactive. The impedance of the circuit Z(s) can be given as
Capacitor C_{1} is chosen to be much greater than C_{g}. The capacitor C_{1} quickly gets charged through a full-wave rectifier and holds its charge until the high voltage switching unit operates in mode 2. The high voltage switching unit is directly connected across the capacitor and operates at a frequency which is much higher than the 100 Hz ripple frequency output of the full-wave rectifier. Hence, the capacitor gets charged and discharged many times in one ripple. Further, the charging and discharging instances of the capacitor are completely arbitrary as there is no feedback to check the voltage level of the capacitor to operate the high voltage switching unit. In this mode, the impedance offered by plasma resistance R_{p} is very high as the plasma discharge has not started in mode 1 of the operation. Therefore, R_{plasma} has been ignored in mode 1 analysis. C_{2} is the equivalent of series capacitance C_{b} and C_{d}. C_{1} represents the equivalent of source capacitance C_{p} of Fig. 5 and the parasitic capacitance across the DBD electrode.
Hence, C_{t}≅C_{g},
The current i(t) flowing from the secondary of the transformer under this condition is given by Eq. (8).Mode 2
As shown in Fig. 6(b), the capacitor C_{1} is charged up to some voltage V_{c1}(0−) in mode 1. In mode 2, the capacitor C_{1} discharges suddenly due to high voltage switching operation. This discharge current is controlled by resistor R_{sw}, which is in the range of 10–100 Ω. The switching stack using switches of high on-state resistance can be used without any current limiting resistance. This gives an advantage in generating high V_{c1}(t_{1}0−) in mode 3 operation and also reduces losses. The leakage reactance of the high voltage transformer is kept very high to limit the switching current below the rated full load current of the transformer. The voltage across capacitor C_{1} is given by the following equation:
While switching, the stored charge in the capacitor during mode 1 discharges through R_{sw} in a very short duration and thus reverses the voltage polarity of the capacitor, C_{1}. This reverse polarity voltage is less than V_{c1}(0−) as some of the energy is dissipated through R_{sw}. Now, the high voltage switch is immediately opened with capacitor C_{1} left with stored charge and reverse polarity. In this mode also, no current flows through the tank circuit as the impedance offered by the air gap is still higher and hence no plasma generation takes place in this mode.Mode 3
When the high voltage switching unit is suddenly opened in mode 2, a high dv/dt appears across the air gap capacitor C_{g} which ionizes the medium and drives a current through it with a large peak and thus generating plasma discharge as a solution of the network comprising C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{g}, L_{s}, and R_{p} as shown in Fig. 6(c). This equation implies that the plasma current and its frequency are governed by L_{s} and C_{1} as follows:
where
The current flowing through this plasma discharge, i(t), can be given by Eq. (13). DC blocking capacitor C_{b} blocks the low frequency, i.e., 50 Hz components from passing through the DBD electrodes. The values of these DC blocking capacitors are much smaller than the dielectric layer capacitance C_{d}. Hence, C_{2} is governed by the value of the DC blocking capacitor.
The computer simulations described in Sec. IV for the DBD plasma power supply architecture along with DBD plasma model validate the analysis of the proposed architecture.
IV. SIMULATION RESULTS
The simulation of the proposed scheme was carried out in MATLAB Simulink as shown in Fig. 7. A voltage source with a high leakage reactance in series is connected directly across the ideal switch and current limiting resistor R_{limit}. A source capacitor is also directly connected across the voltage source with a series inductor. The tank circuit comprises C_{s}, C_{b}, C_{d}, C_{g}, L_{s}, and R_{plasma}. Voltage measurement across L_{s}, C_{d}, C_{g}, and R_{plasma} represents the voltage across the DBD electrodes. The voltage and current across the air gap are shown in Fig. 8. These voltage and current waveforms also indicate that the plasma quenching takes place within 8–10 μs and hence the high voltage switching unit repetition rate can be maximum 100 kHz to prevent streamers’ formation that can take place when the charged particle energy is continuously increasing due to external power supply. During each switching, C_{s} experiences high dv/dt and the stored energy in the capacitor is dissipated in the plasma through large current oscillations across the DBD electrode. This is because the energy in each repetition must be completely dissipated before the occurrence of the next switching.
Plasma resistance dissipates the energy and therefore it tends to damp the voltage and current oscillations. It is important here to note that there is no need of any external resistance to limit the plasma current and hence loss of energy in the external circuit is completely avoided.
Using the simulations, the role of mesh electrodes and C_{s} for generating damped oscillations across DBD load model has also been studied. The meshing of electrodes introduces stray inductance that does not allow instantaneous current change and hence helps in generating enough high voltage across the air gap which is essential to initiate ionization in the air gap. The oscillation frequency is governed by C_{s} and L_{s} as described in operation mode 3. High current oscillations at 1–3 MHz frequency ensure higher plasma density and also take care of the voltage-current characteristics to be in the glow discharge regime because of fast polarity reversal with reducing energy.
Due to highly dynamic nature of plasma especially at atmospheric pressure, plasma resistance varies very fast and hence it is very difficult to define plasma resistance for a particular operating condition. For study purpose, a single operating point for plasma resistance is chosen as this plasma resistance does not affect the oscillation frequency. The simulation results of the static effect of capacitor C_{s} on DBD load voltage and current are shown in Fig. 9 using the same values of L_{s} and R_{plasma}.
The interval between the two current oscillations, as shown in Fig. 10, is significant for stability and homogenous plasma discharge. Therefore, the high voltage switching is done within 100 kHz range to maintain the discharge in the glow discharge regime. Full damping of voltage and current waves across DBD between two switching ensures plasma quenching.
The simulation study of the DBD model with novel switching configuration confirmed the role of the micro-mesh electrode for generating a high electric field for plasma initiation. Current flowing through the high voltage switching unit is shown in Fig. 11. This switching unit needs to withstand very high current at a very high voltage for about 5–10 ns.
A new design for replacing the rotary arc switch with a nano-second high voltage switching unit is shown in Fig. 12. In this technique, a high voltage high current bridge rectifier is proposed to be used in the switching unit to convert high voltage AC into DC. The high voltage DC bridge rectifier protects the switch from negative high voltage biasing. The current limiting resistor R_{limit} is used to limit the current within the IGBT switching stack rating. This high voltage switching stack can take 120 A for very short duration of 5–10 ns in repetitive mode.
V. EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION
For the experimental validation of the proposed power supply architecture for generating DBD plasma in air, a high voltage nano-second switching unit comprising a high voltage rotary arc switch is used. This switching unit can be replaced by an appropriate high voltage rating MOSFET or IGBT stack. High current amplitude through plasma at high frequency maintains streamers’ free high-density glow discharge regime due to fast polarity change across the electrodes.
The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 13. A power source is connected to a pair of cylindrical DBD electrodes 0.7 m in length and separated by a 2 mm air gap. In the simulation results of power supply schematic in Fig. 12, the high voltage switching unit current was also flowing through a high voltage bridge rectifier which is practically very complex because of the non-availability of the high voltage diode of high current ratings. Hence, the power supply schematic was improved as shown in Fig. 14 where the high voltage bridge rectifier current is different and much lower than the high voltage switching stack current. The electrical components of this power supply are a single phase 50 Hz high voltage transformer, a high voltage bridge rectifier using high voltage diodes, the series operation of IGBTs each of 1200 V rating, a IGBT driver unit and capacitors. The high voltage rectifier current as shown in Fig. 15 is controlled by the very high reactive impedance of the transformer.
DBD current was measured using Tektronix differential current probe TCP0030A. The voltage across DBD electrodes was measured through Tektronix high voltage differential probe THDP0200. These probes were connected to Tektronix make high precision scope DPO5204B. Cylindrical DBD electrodes comprise electrically conducting micro-mesh electrodes that are covered by a 100 μm thick PET film as a dielectric on both the mesh electrodes.
A single phase step-up transformer that generates 3 kV_{rms} at the secondary winding is directly connected to either a rotary switch as a high voltage switching unit or high voltage solid state switching unit along with capacitor C_{p} directly connected across it. Transformer leakage impedance is kept very high to withstand high voltage direct switching.
Each time the high voltage switch operates through making and breaking, large current oscillations are generated across the DBD load. These oscillations damp out in maximum 10 μs through plasma resistance as shown in the waveforms of Fig. 16.
The capacitor C_{b} is now fed DC input instead of high voltage AC from a 50 Hz source. Also, the IGBTs are protected from high reverse voltage. The IGBTs have both static and dynamic equalization using R_{1}-R_{4}, C_{1}-C_{4} across each IGBT as shown in Fig. 14. The capacitors C_{1}–C_{4} comprise the capacitor C_{p} of Fig. 12 which plays an important role in the generation of high current oscillation in the air gap of roller electrodes.
This high amplitude and high-frequency oscillations damp out through energy dissipation in plasma. DBD output voltage and current waveforms during experiments are shown in Fig. 17. The peak current is greater than 50 A and peak voltage is nearly 6 kV during the first cycle. Uniform glow discharge plasma was generated in the air gap. Switching in the case of rotary switches would be much lower than the solid state switches due to mechanical limitations. Further, the high repetition of damped oscillations would generate high-density plasma.
The advantage of this technique for generation of DBD plasma is that it generates large current peak across DBD plasma without generating streamers. Damping of current oscillations through plasma resistance ensures reduced energy, which prevents streamers’ formation in the air gap.
If high voltage switching repetition occurs before the oscillations damp out, it may supply continuous energy into the plasma that may lead to the formation of streamers or arc in the air gap and lead to unstable operation. This unstable mode can be avoided by restricting the amount of energy supplied per pulse that ensures the discharge to be in the glow discharge region.
Another advantage of the proposed technique is that it does not require any external resistance to limit the plasma discharge current. The plasma resistance itself is sufficient to provide damping. This essentially means that all dissipation occurs in plasma discharge only and hence the efficiency is higher. In the experimental observations, the rise time of plasma current was observed to be 120 ns that resembles the nanosecond pulse DC supply output. The total duration of one cycle is nearly 0.3–1 μs with damped oscillations of 1–3 MHz frequency.
High peak current (∼50 A) through plasma leads to the formation of sufficient number density of charged particles that is very important for fast surface treatment. DBD voltage may rise to the critical breakdown limit only in the first half cycle of the voltage oscillations. Average plasma energy E_{av,} during each set of oscillations of 8–10 μs, is defined as follows:
Here, n is the total number of oscillations in one high voltage switching pulse. Further, t_{0.125} is the time for one-half cycles of voltage and current. V_{1p,2p,…,np} and I_{1p,2p,…,np} are the voltage and current peaks, respectively, in each positive and negative half cycle. The discharge current has the maximum peak value of 60 A in the first cycle and it gradually reduces in each subsequent half cycle until it damps out completely in about 7.5 μs. The voltage has the maximum peak value of 6 kV in the first cycle of plasma discharge and then gradually reduces to zero in 7.5 μs. Plasma energy in this duration of discharge was 165 mJ. The rms power from the power supply with plasma occurrence rate of 120 Hz is 19.8 W power over the 70 cm^{2} surface area. Therefore, rms plasma power density was observed to be 0.28 W/cm^{2}. However, the plasma power with an energy of 165 mJ for 7.5 μs duration was 22 kW and hence the plasma power density during the discharge duration on 70 cm^{2} surface area was 314 W/cm^{2} when the plasma was on.
DBD plasma discharge between two cylindrical electrodes with the application of high current high-frequency damped oscillations is shown in Fig. 18 (Multimedia view) taken by a Sony SLR α57 camera with standard ISO mode.
VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
A power supply topology for generating atmospheric pressure non-thermal DBD plasma in air is analyzed, simulated, and experimentally validated. High current oscillations of 50 A amplitude across DBD plasma discharge were generated. However, these current oscillations get dissipated within the plasma itself. No external resistor is needed to control the plasma current. DBD rms plasma power density was observed to be 0.28 W/cm^{2}. This is a simple and compact arrangement that generates large current, unlike conventional high voltage nanosecond pulse power sources that generate low current DBD plasma. Further, the voltage level for generating this plasma is quite lower and the number of components is also very less than the conventional supplies and therefore, the cost of the power supply is low. The repetition of these oscillations can be maximum 100 kHz in order to avoid streamers’ formation between the gaps. Mesh electrode configuration helps in generating the high voltage across the DBD electrode. The mesh electrode also forms resonance with the source capacitor in the loop.
Application of this plasma in the treatment of polyester film for surface energy enhancement shows promising results with very fast treatment. Untreated and plasma treated polyester film contact angle is shown in Fig. 19 (Multimedia view). Contact angle after plasma treatment for 15 s on the polymer film surface was observed to be reduced from 105° to 45°. The treated cotton fabric also showed much-improved absorbability after the plasma treatment.
The observed plasma power density was 0.28 W/cm^{2} which corresponds to a switching frequency of 120 Hz. The solid state switching arrangement operating in the range of 1–100 kHz frequency increases the power density significantly. The proposed new circuit topology generates high current oscillations of the order of tens of amperes, unlike conventional high voltage nanosecond pulse techniques that generate DBD current of the order of a few hundred milliamperes. The proposed topology is a low-cost solution for generating high density non-thermal DBD plasma for various tailored applications.
