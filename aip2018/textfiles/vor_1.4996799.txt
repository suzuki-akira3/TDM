Thermochemical nonequilibrium parameter modification of oxygen for a two-temperature model
Thermochemical nonequilibrium parameters of oxygen, O_{2}, for a two-temperature model are proposed in the present work. The rovibrational nonequilibrium and chemical reactions of three low-lying electronic states of O_{2}(X^{3}Σg−, a^{1}Δ_{g}, and b^{1}Σg+) are investigated in one-dimensional post-shock flow environments, including the rovibrational state-to-state kinetics and electronic excitations due to heavy-particle collisions. Based on the results of rigorous state-resolved calculations and state-of-the-art shock-tube experimental data, the nonequilibrium parameters of O_{2} are proposed to improve the two-temperature model accuracy. For shock wave velocities above 3 km/s, the proposed nonequilibrium parameters of the two-temperature model better reproduce the results of the rigorous state-resolved calculations and shock-tube experimental data than do the previous parameters.
I. INTRODUCTION
Thermochemical nonequilibrium models have an important role in analyzing the aerothermodynamics and thermal protection systems of hypersonic flight vehicles. Estimations of the shock stand-off distances and surface heat transfer rates by non-Boltzmann radiation and surface chemical reactions depend on the thermochemical nonequilibrium model accuracy. A previous thermochemical nonequilibrium model of atmospheric gas species was developed with a particular emphasis on the analysis of the aerothermodynamics of Earth re-entry modules for flight speeds above 6 km/s [1,2]. At these typical re-entry speeds that lead to high-temperature and high-enthalpy flows, the thermochemical nonequilibrium phenomena of oxygen, O_{2}, are regarded as less important than the nonequilibrium phenomena of other atmospheric gas species such as nitrogen, N_{2}, and nitric oxide, NO, because the nonequilibrium dissociation of O_{2} quickly occurs immediately behind a strong shock wave. However, in the flight conditions of hypersonic cruise vehicles, where the typical flight speed is approximately 2–5 km/s at 20–40 km altitude with a flow-enthalpy of approximately 6–12 MJ/kg, the nonequilibrium dissociation of O_{2} occurs more slowly than does dissociation at Earth re-entry flight conditions. Then, the presence of O_{2} affects the aerothermodynamics of the post-shock flows and the surface heat transfer rates around hypersonic vehicles. In this respect, the thermochemical nonequilibrium phenomena of O_{2} should be treated as important for the aerothermodynamic analysis of hypersonic cruise vehicles.
In analyses of thermochemical nonequilibrium phenomena, a two-temperature (2-T) model [3] is widely used. In the 2-T model, heavy-particle translational and rotational energies are treated as an equilibrium energy mode of the trans-rotational energy. Electron translational, electronic excitation, and vibrational energies are treated as one nonequilibrium mode: electron-electronic-vibrational energy. The electron-electronic-vibrational energy relaxation to the equilibrium state is calculated using the Landau–Teller equation [3] with time parameters given by the Millikan–White formula [4], which correlates well with the experimental data for many molecular systems of atmospheric gas species. In order to capture the nonequilibrium chemical reactions in the rovibrational quasi-steady state [5–7], the geometrically averaged temperature, evaluated by the trans-rotational and electron-electronic-vibrational temperatures, is employed in the 2-T model. The computational fluid dynamics results calculated using the 2-T model for the atmospheric gas species show fairly good agreement with previous hypersonic flight experiments [8]. However, in recent shock-tube experiments [9,10] and vibrational state-resolved analyses [11,12] for O_{2}, the inaccuracy of the thermochemical nonequilibrium parameters of O_{2} for the 2-T model emerged. The shock-tube experiments by Ibraguimova et_al [10] were carried out for the range of translational temperatures between 4000 K and 10 400 K at the incident shock velocity between 3.07 km/s and 4.44 km/s. The measured vibrational temperature was compared with the electron-electronic-vibrational temperatures calculated by the 2-T model. In the case of 3.07 km/s, the 2-T model accurately reproduces the measured vibrational temperature profiles behind the shock wave. However, for the cases of 3.95 and 4.44 km/s, it was difficult to reproduce the measured vibrational temperature. In the analysis by Neitzel et_al [12], the vibrational state-resolved method and the 2-T model of O_{2} were employed to analyze the post-shock flows of the shock-tube experimental cases [10]. In their work, it was shown that the 2-T model was unable to easily reproduce the experimental data. From these experiments and the theoretical analyses of O_{2}, it is suggested that the thermochemical nonequilibrium parameters of O_{2} for the 2-T model need to be modified to increase the accuracy because most of the parameters of O_{2} were determined in low-enthalpy flows of shock velocity below 3 km/s [13].
Toward this end, a modification of the thermochemical nonequilibrium parameters of O_{2} for the 2-T model is undertaken in the present work. First, in Sec. II, we investigate the availability of the two-temperature model in describing the thermochemical nonequilibrium phenomena of oxygen through the rovibrational state-resolved analysis in a dilute O_{2}–Ar mixture. This is because unlike the other atmospheric gas species, O_{2} has the three-neighbored-electronic states of X^{3}Σg−, a^{1}Δ_{g}, and b^{1}Σg+, and the rotational and vibrational relaxation times of these three electronic states are different from each other. In this state-resolved analysis, one-dimensional (1D) post-shock flow calculations are carried out by coupling with the rovibrational state-to-state kinetics and electronic excitations of the three low-lying electronic states of O_{2}(X^{3}Σg−, a^{1}Δ_{g}, and b^{1}Σg+). In Sec. III, the thermochemical nonequilibrium parameters of oxygen for the two-temperature model are modified by using the previous results of the master equation calculations, the recent shock-tube experimental data, and the results of the present state-resolved calculations of a dilute O_{2}–Ar mixture. In Sec. IV, the validation of the modified thermochemical nonequilibrium parameters of oxygen is carried out by comparing with the results of the state-resolved calculations of the dilute O_{2}–Ar mixture and with the shock-tube experimental data of pure O_{2} in 1D post-shock flow environments. The results calculated by the present and previous thermochemical nonequilibrium parameters of oxygen are compared in the 1D post-shock flow calculations to reproduce the shock-tube experimental data and the 2-D axial symmetric computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations in Sec. V.
II. ROVIBRATIONAL NONEQUILIBRIUM OF O_{2}(X^{3}Σg−, a^{1}Δ_{g}, b^{1}Σg+)
One of the different characteristics of O_{2} compared with the other atmospheric gas species is that the first three electronic states, X^{3}Σg−, a^{1}Δ_{g}, and b^{1}Σg+, are closely spaced. The thermochemical nonequilibrium of these three low-lying electronic states of O_{2} with Ar collisions was studied by Kim and Boyd [7]. The rovibrational state-to-state transition rate constants of O_{2}(X^{3}Σg−, a^{1}Δ_{g}, b^{1}Σg+) + Ar were calculated by the quasi-classical trajectory (QCT) method based on the multibody potential energy surfaces of O_{2} + Ar evaluated from the semiclassical Rydberg, Klein, and Rees (RKR) potential energies [14] of O_{2}. The rovibrational nonequilibrium and coupled chemical reactions were investigated by calculating the system of master equations with the complete sets of the rovibrational state-to-state transition rate constants. From the results of the master equation calculations, it was recognized that the rotational and vibrational relaxation times and chemical reaction rates of the three low-lying electronic states of O_{2}(X^{3}Σg−, a^{1}Δ_{g}, b^{1}Σg+) are different from each other. The relaxation times and reaction rates of the electronically excited states of O_{2}(a^{1}Δ_{g}, b^{1}Σg+) are faster than those of the electronic ground O_{2}(X^{3}Σg−) [7].
In the present work, the rotational and vibrational relaxation times and the chemical reaction rates of the three low-lying electronic states of O_{2}(X^{3}Σg−, a^{1}Δ_{g}, b^{1}Σg+) are investigated in the post-shock flow environments, including the rovibrational state-to-state kinetics of each of these electronic states and electronic excitations due to heavy-particle collisions. Unfortunately, the rovibrational energy transitions in electronically excited O_{2} are only available in O_{2}(X^{3}Σg−, a^{1}Δ_{g}, b^{1}Σg+) + Ar because of the lack of knowledge of the state-to-state transition rate constants in electronically excited states of O_{2}. Thus, rigorous state-resolved analyses of O_{2}(X^{3}Σg−, a^{1}Δ_{g}, b^{1}Σg+) behind strong shock waves are studied in dilute O_{2}–Ar mixtures.
A. Atomic and molecular energies
In order to analyze the rovibrational energy transitions and coupled chemical reactions of O_{2}(X^{3}Σg−, a^{1}Δ_{g}, b^{1}Σg+), the exact rovibrational energies in each electronic state need to be evaluated. The inter-nuclear potential to evaluate the rovibrational energies is represented by the analytical potential function of the Hulburt–Hirschfelder (H-H) type [16] as
where r and r_{e} are the internuclear distance and equilibrium position, respectively. The parameters a, b, and c of Eq. (1) are evaluated from a curve-fit of the semiclassically calculated RKR potential energy [14]. In highly excited states, where the RKR potential is unavailable, the H-H-type potential parameters are determined by the spectroscopic parameters ω_{e}, ω_{e}x_{e}, α_{e}, and B_{e}, obtained from the NIST database [17],
where the parameters F and G are defined as F=α_{e}ω_{e}/6Be2 and G = 8ω_{e}x_{e}/B_{e}, respectively.
In Fig. 1, the inter-nuclear potential energies of O_{2} and the corresponding rovibrational energies of the three low-lying electronic states of O_{2}(X^{3}Σg−, a^{1}Δ_{g}, b^{1}Σg+) are presented. The potential energy curves evaluated by the analytical function are compared with the semiclassically calculated RKR potential energy and the ab initio calculated values [18]. In O_{2}(X^{3}Σg−), the present analytical function of the H-H potential agrees with the ab initio calculated and RKR potential energy values. In O_{2}, the electronic states X^{3}Σg−, a^{1}Δ_{g}, and b^{1}Σg+ are closely spaced, and the threshold energies between the X^{3}Σg−-a^{1}Δ_{g} and a^{1}Δ_{g}-b^{1}Σg+ transitions are below 1.0 eV. The rovibrational states and energies of the three low-lying electronic states of O_{2}(X^{3}Σg−, a^{1}Δ_{g}, b^{1}Σg+) are evaluated by the Wentzel, Kramers, and Brillouin (WKB) method based on the present H-H potential energy curves. Then, the total numbers of rovibrational states of O_{2}(X^{3}Σg−, v, J), O_{2}(a^{1}Δ_{g}, v, J), and O_{2}(b^{1}Σg+, v, J) are 5117, 3854, and 3221, respectively. In the present work, the best available state-resolved kinetics of the rovibrational states are adopted to describe the rovibrational energy transitions and their coupled chemical reactions in dilute O_{2}–Ar mixtures.
In atomic O, the electronic ground state ^{3}P has the multiplicity of J = 1–3, and three low-lying electronic states of O_{2}(X^{3}Σg−, a^{1}Δ_{g}, b^{1}Σg+) are constructed with O(^{3}P_{J=0}), O(^{3}P_{J=1}), and O(^{3}P_{J=2}). In the present work, we separately treat the electronic ground state of O(^{3}P) as O(^{3}P_{J=0}), O(^{3}P_{J=1}), and O(^{3}P_{J=2}) to analyze the rovibrational nonequilibrium of O_{2}(X^{3}Σg−, a^{1}Δ_{g}, b^{1}Σg+), and the electronic energies of O(^{3}P_{J=0,1,2}) are obtained from the NIST database. In O2+ and Ar, the electronic ground states of O2+(X^{2}Π_{g}) and Ar(^{1}S) are employed because the ionization of O_{2} and the electronic excitation of Ar are less important nonequilibrium phenomena in post-shock flows for shock velocities between 2 km/s and 5 km/s. In the present work, the vibrational energies of O2+(X^{2}Π_{g}, v) are calculated by the Dunham expansion model [3] with the spectroscopic parameters ω_{e} and ω_{e}x_{e} obtained from the NIST database [17].
B. Nonequilibrium energy model
In Fig. 2, the nonequilibrium energy model is presented to analyze the energy transitions and chemical reactions by the state-resolved method in dilute O_{2}–Ar mixtures. The heavy-particle translational energies of O, O_{2}, and Ar and trans-rotational energy of O2+ are treated as equilibrium energy modes. The electron–electronic, rotational, and vibrational energy modes are treated as the nonequilibrium energy modes. To analyze the energy transitions and chemical reactions by the rigorous state-resolved method, the thermochemical nonequilibrium of O_{2} needs to be investigated through the rovibrational state-to-state kinetics with electronic excitations by coupling with the 1D post-shock flows. However, it is difficult to describe the state-resolved energy transitions by the fully coupled electronic and rovibrational state-to-state transitions by the heavy-particle collisions. In the present work, we separately treat the electronic excitations and rovibrational transitions of O_{2} and describe each energy transition with the best available state-to-state kinetics.
In the electron–electronic energy mode, the electronic excitations rapidly occur through the electron collisions, and these electronic excitations by the electron collisions are treated by using the concept of the electron–electronic energy pool. In order to accurately describe the electronic excitations due to the heavy-particle collisions, the electronic state-to-state kinetics of O(^{3}P_{J=0,1,2}) and O_{2}(X^{3}Σg−, a^{1}Δ_{g}, b^{1}Σg+) by the collisions of O, O_{2}, O2+, and Ar are employed. In the rotational and vibrational energy modes, the dominant mechanism of the rovibrational energy transitions of O_{2}(X^{3}Σg−, a^{1}Δ_{g}, b^{1}Σg+) is by Ar collisions in dilute O_{2}–Ar mixtures. Thus, the rovibrational energy transitions in the three low-lying electronic states are described by using the rovibrational state-to-state kinetics of O_{2}(X^{3}Σg−, a^{1}Δ_{g}, b^{1}Σg+) + Ar. However, the rovibrational energy transitions by O, O_{2}, and O2+ collisions are difficult to describe by the state-resolved method because of the lack of knowledge of the rovibrational state-to-state transition rate constants of O_{2}(X^{3}Σg−, a^{1}Δ_{g}, b^{1}Σg+). In the present work, we treat the rovibrational energy transitions due to O, O_{2}, and O2+ collisions by using the Landau–Teller equations [3], including the rotational-to-translational (R–T) and vibrational-to-translational (V–T) energy transfers, and the relaxation times of the R–T and V–T energy transfers are obtained from the work of Parker [15] and the compilation work of Park [2], respectively. The chemical reactions involve the dissociation of O_{2} and associative ionization. The dissociation in the three low-lying electronic states of O_{2}(X^{3}Σg−, a^{1}Δ_{g}, b^{1}Σg+) due to Ar collisions are described by the state-resolved kinetics, while the dissociation by the other heavy-particle collisions and the associative ionizations are described by an Arrhenius-type behavior, which is typically adopted in the 2-T model. The types of the state-to-state kinetics and chemical reactions considered in the present work are shown in Table I.
C. State-to-state transition rate constant
The inelastic collisions between O and the other species lead to the electronic excitation and de-excitation of O(^{3}P_{J=0,1,2}). In the present work, the electronic state-to-state transition rate constants of the first three electronic states of O(^{3}P_{J=0,1,2}) due to the heavy-particle collisions are determined by the model proposed by Bultel et_al [19] In the atomic collisions O–O and O–Ar, the electronic excitation cross sections are described by the following equation [20]:
where ϵ is the relative kinetic energy and E_{jexiex} is the threshold energy between the electronic states i_{ex} and j_{ex}. In the present work, the value of β is obtained from the work of Bultel et_al [19,21] as 3.4 × 10^{−25} m^{2}/eV, and it applies to describe the O + O and O + Ar collisions. In the work of Bultel et_al [19,21], the value of β was determined with the assumption that the parameter β is weakly dependent on the mass, and the value of β for the heavy-particle collisions was derived from the case of Ar–Ar collisions. In the molecular collisions O–O_{2} and O–O2+, the excitation cross sections are determined as
In the present work, we adopt the cross section σ_{0}≃ 10^{−20} m^{2} to reproduce the measured rate coefficients of the quenching rate of O_{2} + Ar. One employs this cross section value to describe the electronic excitation of atoms and molecules under any heavy-particle collisions, unless experimental data exist [19]. The electronic state-to-state transition rate constants are determined by using the cross sections of the electronic excitations of Eqs. (5) and (6) with the Boltzmann integrations. The state-to-state rate constants for the de-excitation transitions of the electronic states O(^{3}P_{J=0,1,2}) are evaluated by invoking the detailed-balance principle [3].
In the electronic state-to-state transitions of O_{2}(X^{3}Σg−, a^{1}Δ_{g}, b^{1}Σg+), the de-excitation rates due to Ar collisions have been measured in a quenching experiment [22–24] at room temperature. In the present work, the electronic state-to-state transition rate constants of O_{2}(X^{3}Σg−, a^{1}Δ_{g}, b^{1}Σg+) by Ar collisions are evaluated by using Eq. (6) with the Boltzmann integrations, and the collision parameter σ_{0} = 1.0 × 10^{−24} m^{2} is employed to reproduce the experimental data [22–24] of the de-excitation rates. The electronic state-to-state transition rate constants of O_{2}(X^{3}Σg−, a^{1}Δ_{g}, b^{1}Σg+) due to O, O_{2}, and O2+ collisions are evaluated by using the model proposed by Park [25]. In Table II, the curve-fit parameters of the rate constants for O_{2} + M are tabulated following the rate expression proposed by Park [25].
In Fig. 3, the de-excitation and excitation rate constants of O_{2}(X^{3}Σg−, a^{1}Δ_{g}, b^{1}Σg+) are presented. In Fig. 3(a), the present de-excitation rate constants due to Ar collisions are compared with the measured data of the quenching experiments [22–24] for the a^{1}Δ_{g}-X^{3}Σg− and b^{1}Σg+-a^{1}Δ_{g} transitions. The electronic state-to-state transition rate constants evaluated by the present work agree well with the experimental measured values at room temperature. In Fig. 3(b), the electronic excitation rate constants due to Ar collisions are compared with the rate constants due the O, O_{2}, and N_{2} collisions. In the electronic excitations of O_{2}, O is a more efficient collider than the other heavy-particles (O_{2}, N_{2}, and Ar). However, in dilute O_{2}–Ar mixtures, the electronic excitation of O_{2} immediately behind the strong shock waves mainly occurs through Ar collisions, and the excitation rate constants of Ar collisions have similar values to those of N_{2} collisions in X^{3}Σg−-a^{1}Δ_{g} and a^{1}Δ_{g}-b^{1}Σg+ transitions.
The complete sets of the rovibrational state-to-state transition rate constants of O_{2}(X^{3}Σg−, a^{1}Δ_{g}, b^{1}Σg+) due to Ar collisions are obtained from the work of Kim and Boyd [7]. The rate constants were calculated by the QCT method based on the multibody potential energy surfaces of O_{2}(X^{3}Σg−, a^{1}Δ_{g}, b^{1}Σg+) + Ar. All the trajectories were initialized by the internal energies that correspond precisely to each of the 5117, 3854, and 3221 rovibrational states of O_{2}(X^{3}Σg−), O_{2}(a^{1}Δ_{g}), and O_{2}(b^{1}Σg+), respectively. In the QCT calculations, stratified sampling was employed to obtain the impact parameter, and all other parameters were integrated by a Monte Carlo method. In each trajectory calculation, a total of 2000 trajectories were calculated per impact parameter at a batch size of 0.1 A for 0.1 eV–20 eV. A database of the rovibrational state-to-state transition rate constants for O_{2}(X^{3}Σg−, a^{1}Δ_{g}, b^{1}Σg+) + Ar was constructed for translational temperatures from 1000 K to 20 000 K including the quasi-bound states of O_{2}. In the present work, the rovibrational state-to-state transitions of the three low-lying electronic states of O_{2}(X^{3}Σg−, a^{1}Δ_{g}, b^{1}Σg+) are described by using the rigorous state-to-state kinetics with the complete sets of transition rate constants of O_{2}(X^{3}Σg−, a^{1}Δ_{g}, b^{1}Σg+) + Ar in dilute O_{2}–Ar mixtures.
D. 1D post-shock flow calculation of dilute O_{2}–Ar mixtures
The state-resolved flow calculations of the dilute O_{2}–Ar mixtures behind a shock wave are performed by coupling of the electronic and rovibrational state-to-state kinetics and 1D post-shock flow equations to analyze the rovibrational energy transitions and coupled chemical reactions of the three low-lying electronic states O_{2}(X^{3}Σg−, a^{1}Δ_{g}, b^{1}Σg+). In the present work, the radiative transitions and ionization due to electron and heavy-particle collisions are ignored because these nonequilibrium phenomena are negligible in flow conditions where the thermochemical nonequilibrium O_{2} is important. By using the best available state-to-state transition rate constants, the rovibrational and species conservation equations of 1D post-shock flows can be written as follows:
where u is the velocity and x is the distance from the shock wave. The indices e, v, and J denote the electronic, rotational, and vibrational states, respectively, of O and O_{2}. γ is the rovibrational or species concentration. Q is the internal energy partition function [3] of the electronic and rovibrational states. Q_{t} is the partition function for the heavy-particle translational energy [3].N_{a} is Avogadro’s number, ρ is the density, and k is the Boltzmann constant. In the present work, the rovibrational concentrations γ_{O2}(evJ) are treated as a state-resolved method, and a total of 12 191 equations exist for 5117 of O_{2}(X^{3}Σg−), 3854 of O_{2}(a^{1}Δ_{g}), and 3221 of O_{2}(b^{1}Σg+) states. The complete sets of the rovibrational state-to-state transition rate constants K^{RV} of O_{2}(X^{3}Σg−, a^{1}Δ_{g}, b^{1}Σg+) due to the Ar collisions are employed to treat the state-resolved rovibrational transitions and chemical reactions in the electronically excited states of O_{2}(X^{3}Σg−, a^{1}Δ_{g}, b^{1}Σg+). The nonequilibrium chemical reactions of the dissociation ω̇{D} and associative ionization ω̇{AI} that cannot be described by the state-resolved method are treated as Arrhenius-type reactions, expressed by the rate constants K_{f}. The reverse rate constants K_{r} are determined by using the equilibrium constants [3]K_{e} corresponding to the types of chemical reactions. The reaction parameters K_{f} are obtained from the compilation work of Park [1,2], and the equilibrium constants K_{e} are obtained from the work of Kim [26].
In the nonequilibrium electron–electronic, rotational, and vibrational energies, the electron-to-vibrational (e–V) energy and electron-to-translational (e–T) energy transfers are considered with the R-T and V-T energy transfers in order to analyze the post-shock flows of the dilute O_{2}–Ar mixtures. Then, the nonequilibrium energies are calculated using the following equations:
where E_{eex}, E_{r}, and E_{v} are the electron–electronic, rotational, and vibrational energies, respectively. T_{eex}, T_{r}, and T_{v} are the nonequilibrium temperatures corresponding to each energy, and these nonequilibrium temperatures are evaluated by the energy equivalent method [5–7]. For the electron–electronic energy, the electronic state-to-state transition rate constants K^{ex} are adopted to describe the electronic excitations of O and O_{2} due to the heavy-particle collisions. In the e–V energy transfer, the e–V relaxation parameters τ_{e–V} of O_{2} are obtained from the work of Babikian et_al [27] For the rotational and vibrational energies of O_{2}, the rovibrational state-to-state kinetics by Ar collisions are employed, and the energy relaxation by O, O_{2}, and O2+ collisions are treated by using the Landau–Teller equations with the R–T and V–T energy relaxation parameters τ_{r} and τ_{v}, respectively. In the present work, the relaxation parameters τ_{r} and τ_{v} are determined by the Millikan–White formula with the high-temperature correction term [1,2].ē is the averaged energy evaluated by the Boltzmann distributions specified with the nonequilibrium temperature. In the e–T energy transfer of Eq. (14), the collision frequency v_{s} is calculated by the following equation:
where n_{s} is the species number density and m_{e} is the electron mass. In the present work, the effective cross section σ_{e,s} for neutral species is obtained from a curve-fit proposed by Gnoffo et_al [28] For charged species, the effective cross section with the Debye cutoff approximation [3] is adopted in the present work,
where n_{e} is the electron number density. In the V–T energy transfer of Eq. (16), the Millikan–White relaxation parameter [1,2,4]τ_{v} with the collision-limited correction term [13]τ_{c} is adopted in the present work. This collision-limited correction term is defined as
where n_{t} and μ are the total number density of colliding particles and the average mass of the mixture, respectively. In Eq. (20), σv* is set to 3.0 × 10^{−17} cm^{2} as proposed by Park [13]. The vibrational diffusion correction factor f_{D} of the V–T energy transfer in Eq. (16) is defined as
where a is an arbitrary parameter given as 3.5 × exp(−5000/T_{s}), proposed by Park [13].T_{s} and T_{vs} are the translational and vibrational temperatures immediately behind the shock wave.
The analysis of the rovibrational energy transitions and coupled chemical reactions of the three low-lying electronic states of O_{2} is carried out by calculating the 1D post-shock flow equations of Eqs. (7)–(16). The flow conditions immediately behind a strong shock wave are determined by using the Rankine–Hugoniot relations for electronic and rovibrational frozen flows. The 1D post-shock flow equations are calculated by an implicit integration method with parallelization algorithms adopted by Kim and Boyd [29]. In the present work, the post-shock flow analyses are carried out for shock velocities from 2 km/s to 4 km/s with a pressure of 10.0 Torr and temperature of 293 K. In these calculations, dilute O_{2}(5%)-Ar(95%) mixtures are employed in order to describe the rovibrational energy transitions and coupled chemical reactions of the three low-lying electronically excited states X^{3}Σg−, a^{1}Δ_{g}, and b^{1}Σg+.
In Fig. 4, the relaxations of the nonequilibrium temperatures and energies and the electronic concentration of the three low-lying electronic states of O_{2} behind a shock wave are presented. In order to analyze the electronic excitation and rovibrational energy transitions due to the heavy-particle collisions, the dissociation and associative ionization are prohibited in these calculations. In Fig. 4(a), the rotational temperature rapidly converges to the equilibrium values behind a shock wave for the shock velocity cases of 2.5 km/s and 3.5 km/s. This shows that the rotational energy can be treated as an equilibrium mode, and the assumption of the 2-T model is available in the flow conditions where the thermochemical nonequilibrium of O_{2} is important. The relaxation of the vibrational temperature is slow enough to be treated as a nonequilibrium energy mode. However, the relaxation of the electron–electronic temperature is much slower than the rotational and vibrational temperatures, and this shows that the heavy-particle collisions do not efficiently induce the electronic excitation of O_{2} in the flow conditions of 2-4 km/s. In Figs. 4(b) and 4(c), the energy portion of the rotational, vibrational, and electron–electronic energies and the electronic concentrations are presented, respectively. In comparison with the rotational and vibrational energies, the relaxation of the electron–electronic energy is much slower and the electron–electronic energy is three orders of magnitude lower than the rotational and vibrational energies. In Fig. 4(c), the electronic concentrations of the electronically excited a^{1}Δ_{g} and b^{1}Σg+ states are four to six orders less than that of the electronic ground state. These results show that the electronic energy and concentration of the electronically excited states due to the heavy-particle collisions are relatively small in comparison with the rotational and vibrational energies and cannot be significantly affected by the enthalpy of the entire flow field behind a shock wave.
In Fig. 5, the normalized vibrational populations in each of the electronically excited states X^{3}Σg−, a^{1}Δ_{g}, and b^{1}Σg+ behind a shock wave are presented for the shock velocity cases of 2.5 km/s and 3.5 km/s. The normalized populations are determined by dividing the vibrational number density by the total number density of each electronic state. Behind a shock wave, the vibrational populations of each electronic state are different from each other, and the differences in the vibrational populations of the 2.5 km/s case are larger than those of the 3.5 km/s case. This is because the vibrational relaxation times of the three low-lying electronic states are different from each other, and the differences in the relaxation times become larger at temperatures below 10 000 K. However, the vibrational populations of the electronically excited states O_{2}(a^{1}Δ_{g}) and O_{2}(b^{1}Σg+) do not affect the total amount of the vibrational relaxation of O_{2} in the post-shock flow environment because the electronic populations of O_{2}(a^{1}Δ_{g}) and O_{2}(b^{1}Σg+) due to the heavy-particle collisions are smaller than those in the electronic ground state, as shown in Fig. 4.
In Fig. 6, the nonequilibrium temperatures and species concentrations behind a shock wave are compared between the cases of the three low-lying electronic states and the electronic ground state only. The post-shock flow calculations are carried out in the conditions of a shock velocity of 4 km/s with a pressure of 10.0 Torr. Until a distance of 0.1 cm, where the rotational and vibrational nonequilibrium exists, the rotational and vibrational temperatures including the three low-lying electronic states of O_{2} have the same values as the case of the electronic ground state of O_{2}. This is because the rovibrational energy transitions and coupled chemical reactions of the electronically excited states O_{2}(a^{1}Δ_{g}) and O_{2}(b^{1}Σg+) do not significantly affect the rotational and vibrational relaxations and the chemical reactions of O_{2} for the entire flow field. After a distance of 0.1 cm, the electrons are generated by associative ionization, and electronic excitations due to electron collisions rapidly occur. However, the differences in electron–electronic temperatures between the cases of the three low-lying electronic states and just the electronic ground state are quite small. In Fig. 6(b), the species concentrations have almost identical values to the case of the electronic ground state.
In the state-resolved analyses of the dilute O_{2}–Ar mixtures for the shock velocity of 2–4 km/s, it is recognized that the rotational relaxation of O_{2} is fast enough to be treated as an equilibrium mode, and the vibration energy relaxations of the three low-lying electronic states O_{2}(X^{3}Σg−, a^{1}Δ_{g}, b^{1}Σg+) are different from each other. However, the vibration nonequilibrium and coupled chemical reactions of O_{2} behind a shock wave are mostly influenced by those of the electronic ground state because the electronic excitations due to heavy-particle collisions are not significant. In this respect, the thermochemical nonequilibrium of O_{2} behind a shock wave for the shock velocity of 2–4 km/s can be represented by the 2-T model of the thermochemical nonequilibrium of O_{2}(X^{3}Σg−).
III. THERMOCHEMICAL NONEQUILIBRIUM MODELING OF O_{2}
A. Thermochemical nonequilibrium parameters of the 2-T model
In the present work, based on the results of the state-resolved analysis of the dilute O_{2}–Ar mixtures and the recent shock-tube experiments on O_{2}, thermochemical nonequilibrium parameters of O_{2} for the 2-T model are proposed to increase the accuracy of the thermochemical nonequilibrium model of O_{2}. The vibrational relaxation parameters with the high-temperature correction term, the reaction rate constants of the Arrhenius-type of equations, the equilibrium constants for the reverse chemical reactions, and the energy-loss parameters for the vibrational energy conservation due to the chemical reactions are proposed in the present work.
In Fig. 7, the rotational and vibrational energy relaxations of O_{2} are presented. In the 2-T model, the vibrational energy relaxation τ_{v} is described by using the Millikan–White formula [4] as
In the present work, the relaxation parameters A and B due to O_{2} and Ar collisions are determined by using the shock-tube experimental data [4,30] and the results of the master equation calculations [7], while the relaxation parameters due to O and He collisions are determined using the results of the master equation calculations for O_{2} + O by Andrienko and Boyd [11] and the compilation work of Park [1,2], respectively. At high temperatures, the cross section to modify the vibrational relaxation was proposed by Park [13] with the assumption that the vibrational relaxation cannot be faster than the elastic collision. However, in recent master equation calculations of O_{2} + Ar [7], it was observed that the vibrational energy relaxation of O_{2} converges to the rotational energy relaxation for temperatures above 10 000 K. This phenomenon of vibrational energy relaxation was also observed in the master equation analysis [5,6] of N_{2} and H_{2}. In the present work, the high-temperature correction term of Eq. (19) is evaluated by using the results of master equation calculations and the shock-tube measured values [7,31] with the assumptions that the rotational and vibrational relaxation times are converged with each other. The vibrational relaxation parameters A and B determined by the curve-fit method using the Millikan–White formula of Eq. (22) and the cross sections of the high-temperature correction are tabulated in Table III.
In Fig. 8, the measured and calculated dissociation rate constants of O_{2} by the shock-tube experiments [9,10,32–38] and the master equation calculations [7] are presented. In the 2-T model, the reaction rate constants K_{f} are calculated by the Arrhenius-type equation as
where T_{a} is a geometrical averaged temperature of T_{a}=T^{α}Teevβ, and T and T_{eev} are the trans-rotation and electron-electronic-vibrational temperatures, respectively. In the present work, the Arrhenius rate parameters C, η, and Θ of the chemical reactions of O_{2} are determined by using the best available shock-tube experimental data and the results of the master equation calculations. In O_{2} + Ar, the dissociation of O_{2} is mainly influenced by the dissociation of O_{2}(X^{3}Σg−) + Ar because the electronic excitations due to heavy-particle collisions are not significant. In the present work, the Arrhenius rate parameters of the dissociation of O_{2} + Ar are determined by using these calculated reaction rate constants of O_{2}(X^{3}Σg−) + Ar. For O_{2} + O and O_{2} + O_{2}, shock-tube experiments [9,10] were recently carried out to measure the dissociation rate constants of O_{2}. In these shock-tube experiments, a high-pressure chamber was filled with a stoichiometric mixture of hydrogen and oxygen diluted by helium, and a low-pressure chamber was filled with pure oxygen. From the detonation of a driven section by an electric pulse, the high-temperature conditions of 4000–10 000 K behind the incident shock waves were generated. In these high-temperature conditions, the dissociation of O_{2} occurs in the vibrational nonequilibrium status. In the present work, the Arrhenius rate parameters of the dissociation of O_{2} due to O and O_{2} collisions are determined by using the shock-tube experimental data of Ibraguimova et_al [9,10] For the dissociation of O_{2} due to He collisions and the associative ionization by O + O, the Arrhenius rate parameters proposed by Park [1,2] and Baulch et_al [32] are adopted. The Arrhenius rate parameters of the chemical reactions of O_{2} are tabulated in Table IV.
In the 2-T model, the recombination rate constants of the neutral and ion are evaluated by using the equilibrium constants K_{e} as K_{r} = K_{f}/K_{e}. The equilibrium constant for the dissociation of O_{2} + M ↔ O + O + M is defined as
Because the potential energy is distorted by the rotational excitation, the effective potential energy needs to be considered to determine the molecular dissociation energy. In the present work, the molecular dissociation energy D depending on the electronic and rotational states is employed to calculate the equilibrium constants of the dissociation reaction. For the associative ionization of O+O↔O2++e^{−}, the equilibrium constant is defined as
In evaluating the equilibrium constant, the electronic energy grouping model [40] is adopted to determine the electronic states of O. In this grouping model, the maximum principle quantum number of n = 10 is employed. The electronic states of O, O_{2}, and O2+ included in the calculations of the equilibrium constants are tabulated in Table V.
In the present work, the calculated equilibrium constants of the O + O recombination and associative ionization rates are fitted by the expression
where Z = 10 000/T. The parameters A_{1} to A_{5} of the equilibrium constants are tabulated in Table VI.
In Fig. 9, the present equilibrium constants and the recombination rates are compared with the previous equilibrium constants [2] and experimental data [36,39,41–43]. Comparing the present equilibrium constants with the previous values, the present equilibrium constants of the associative ionization have identical values with the previous equilibrium constants. However, the equilibrium constants of the dissociation reactions have significant differences with the previous values below 3000 K. This is because the previous equilibrium constants were optimized for the temperature conditions above 3000 K. Most of the recombination reactions occur at temperatures below 3000 K, and such differences in the equilibrium constants can lead to differences in the recombination rates. In Fig. 9(b), the calculated recombination rate constants are compared with the existing measured values [36,39,41–43]. The recombination rate constants calculated by the present equilibrium constants more closely reproduce the experimental measured values than the rate constants calculated by the previous equilibrium constants for the temperature range of 300 K–3000 K.
In dissociation reactions due to heavy-particle collisions, the vibrational energy contained in the pre-dissociated molecule is transferred to the translational energy of the post-dissociated particles. This energy transfer phenomenon can be described through the state-to-state kinetics. However, in the 2-T model, it is difficult to describe state-resolved chemical reactions and the amount of energy transfer to the post-dissociated particles during these collisions. Thus, it is necessary to remove the vibrational energy of the pre-dissociated molecule from the electron-electronic-vibrational energy pool. In this preferred dissociation model, the vibrational energy removal due to the dissociation is expressed by using the vibrational energy loss ratio Ψ_{v} multiplying with the dissociation energy.
In Fig. 10, the vibrational energy loss ratio evaluated by the state-resolved 1D post-shock flow calculations is presented for the shock velocities of 2-4 km/s. In these calculations, the vibrational energy removal is calculated by the state-to-state kinetics of the bound–free transitions. Then, the vibrational energy loss ratio can be determined by using the energy removal values, where the dissociation dominantly occurred. In a typical 2-T model, the vibrational energy loss due to the dissociation has a constant value of 0.3. However, in state-resolved calculations, the energy loss ratio has temperature-dependent values. In the present work, the vibrational energy ratios are fitted by using the following expression:
and the parameters K_{1}–K_{5} are tabulated in Table VII.
IV. 1D POST-SHOCK FLOW CALCULATION
A. Comparison of the 2-T model and the state-resolved method
By using the present thermochemical nonequilibrium parameters of O_{2}, the electron-electronic-vibrational equations of the 2-T model can be constructed as
The 1D post-shock flow calculations are performed by using the present thermochemical nonequilibrium parameters of O_{2}. In order to validate the accuracies of the thermochemical nonequilibrium parameters, the results of the 1D post-shock flow calculations by the 2-T model are compared with those by the 1D state-resolved flow calculations in the dilute O_{2}–Ar mixtures.
In Fig. 11, the rotational and vibrational temperatures calculated by the 2-T model and the state-resolved method without the chemical reactions are compared for the shock velocity cases of 2.5 km/s and 3.5 km/s. In the 2-T model, trans-rotational temperature is employed to describe the rotational populations of the Boltzmann distribution, based on the assumption that the rotational energy relaxation is fast enough to be treated as an equilibrium mode. The rotational and vibrational energy transitions are described by the detailed state-to-state kinetics in the state-resolved method. In the case of the shock velocity of 2.5 km/s, the relaxation of the rotational energy to the equilibrium state rapidly occurs in the state-resolved calculations, and the electron-electronic-vibrational temperature of the 2-T model appears to be equal to the vibrational temperature calculated by the state-resolved method. In the case of 3.5 km/s, the electron-electronic-vibrational temperature of the 2-T model is close to the vibrational temperature calculated by the state-resolved method even though the relaxation of the rotational energy is slower than that in the case of 2.5 km/s.
In Fig. 12, the availability of the bridging model of O_{2} is investigated in the 1D post-shock flows without the chemical reactions. The vibrational diffusion phenomena caused by the differences in the vibrational relaxation time between the low and high vibrational states occur behind a strong shock wave. In describing the vibrational diffusion phenomenon, the vibrational bridging model of Eq. (21) is adopted. The vibrational bridging model behind a strong shock wave has been investigated for N_{2} [13]. However, the availability of the bridging model has not been investigated for O_{2}. In the present work, the electron-electronic-vibrational temperature behind a strong shock wave is calculated for a shock velocity of 3.5 km/s, and comparisons with the 2-T model and state-resolved method are made. In the state-resolved method, the anharmonicity of the vibrational states of O_{2} is described by the rovibrational state-to-state kinetics. In Fig. 12, it is shown that the electron-electronic-vibration temperature of the 2-T model without the bridging model is more consistent with the vibrational temperature of the state-resolved method than the case with the bridging model. This is because the vibrational populations of the highly excited states are not significant, as shown in Fig. 5, and the anharmonicity of the highly excited states can be neglected for O_{2} at inter-mediate hypersonic speeds below 4 km/s.
In Fig. 13, the normalized vibrational populations of O_{2} behind a shock wave are presented for the shock velocities of 2.5 km/s and 3.5 km/s. In the 2-T model, vibrational populations are reproduced by the Boltzmann distribution specified with the electron-electronic-vibration temperature. For shock velocities of 2.5 km/s and 3.5 km/s, the vibrational populations of the highly excited states above v = 6 have non-Boltzmann distributions and large deviations of the vibrational populations exist between the 2-T model and state-resolved method. However, below the vibrational states of v = 6, the populations of the 2-T model have identical values to those of the state-resolved method. Most of the population is distributed in the lower vibrational states below v = 6, indicating that the 2-T model is sufficient to describe the thermochemical nonequilibrium of O_{2} for the shock velocities in the range 2–4 km/s.
In the 2-T model, the vibrational energy contained in the dissociated molecule needs to be removed from the electron-electronic-vibrational energy pool because the vibrational energy due to dissociation cannot be automatically conserved. In describing the vibrational energy removal due to the chemical reactions, the preferential and non-preferential models are widely used in calculating the post-shock flows. However, the availability of the energy removal model has not been investigated for O_{2}. In Fig. 14, the preferential and non-preferential models for the dissociation reactions are compared. In the preferential energy model, it is assumed that the molecules are created or destroyed at higher vibrational energy levels based on the coupled-vibration-dissociation-vibration theory [44]. In the non-preferential model, it is assumed that the molecules are created or destroyed at the averaged vibrational energy. In Figs. 14(a) and 14(b), the species concentrations calculated by the 2-T model behind a strong shock wave are presented for the cases of the shock velocities of 3.0 km/s and 4.0 km/s. In the case of 3 km/s, the species concentrations of the preferential model are almost identical to those of the non-preferential model. However, for the case of 4 km/s, in which the chemical reaction rapidly occurs, the species concentrations of the preferential model are closer to those calculated by the state-resolved method than those of the non-preferential model. In Fig. 14(c), the electron-electronic-vibrational energy of the preferential and non-preferential models is compared with the vibrational energy calculated by the state-resolved method. In the case of the shock velocity of 4 km/s, the vibrational energy removal due to the dissociation is more significant than that of the case of 3 km/s, and the electron-electronic-vibrational energy of the preferential model agrees well with the vibrational energy calculated by the state-resolved method.
In Fig. 15, the availability of the average temperatures of the 2-T model is investigated. In the 2-T model, the average temperature T_{a}=T^{α}Teevβ is employed to describe the nonequilibrium chemical reactions because the vibrationally excited molecules are more likely to dissociate. Two different sets of values are typically used for α and β: α = β = 0.5 or α = 0.7 and β = 0.3. In Figs. 15(a) and 15(b), the temperatures and species concentrations by the two sets of averaged temperatures are compared with those by the state-resolved method for the shock velocity case of 4 km/s. Comparing the temperatures, the electron-electronic-vibrational temperature calculated by the set of α = β = 0.5 is slightly higher than the temperature calculated by the set of α = 0.7 and β = 0.3. However, for the species concentrations, the difference between the two sets of parameter values is not significant. In Fig. 15(c), the vibrational populations of the set of α = β = 0.5 are compared with the populations calculated by the state-resolved method. For the vibrational state below v = 6, the vibrational populations calculated by the 2-T model with the parameters α = β = 0.5 have similar values to the populations calculated by the state-resolved method. In the quasi-steady-state (QSS) region at x = 0.03 and x = 0.1, where the chemical reactions dominantly occur, the vibrational populations calculated by the 2-T model with the parameters α = β = 0.5 can adequately describe the vibrational distributions calculated by the state-resolved method. These results show that the 2-T model with the geometrically averaged temperature of α = β = 0.5 is able to describe the vibrationally favored chemical reactions.
B. Reproducing the shock-tube experiment for O_{2}
The shock-tube experiments are reproduced by the 2-T model with the present thermochemical nonequilibrium parameters of O_{2}. In the present work, three cases of the shock-tube experiments by Owen et_al [45], Matthews [34], and Ibraguimova et_al [10] are adopted. The conditions and measured data of the shock-tube experiments are tabulated in Table VIII.
In the shock-tube experiments by Owen et_al [45], the vibrational temperatures of O_{2} were measured behind the reflected shock wave. Laser absorption spectroscopy was used to measure the population of the vibrational states of O_{2}(X^{3}Σg−) behind the reflected shock waves in the dilute O_{2}–Ar mixtures. The vibrational temperature was modeled based on the absorption spectroscopy of UV due to the Schumann–Runge (B^{3}Σu−-X^{3}Σg−) system of wavelengths in the range 130–270 nm. In these experiments, the measurements were carried out for the flow conditions of P_{1} = 7.12 Torr with the incident shock velocity of U_{S} = 1.174 km/s. In the present work, the shock-tube experiment is reproduced by using the 2-T model with the present thermochemical nonequilibrium parameters of O_{2}. The SHOCK1D code is adopted to calculate the 1D flows inside the shock-tube to describe the thermochemical nonequilibrium of O_{2}. In SHOCK1D, the quasi-1D Navier–Stokes equations are numerically solved including the thermochemical nonequilibrium of the 2-T model. A modified Steger–Warming flux vector splitting scheme is used to discretize the inviscid flux across cell faces. The diffusion of species is modeled by an approximation to the solution of the Stefan–Maxwell equations, and the transport properties of the gas mixture are modeled using the Gupta mixing rule. A 4th order Runge–Kutta method is employed for explicit time integration in the SHOCK1D code.
In Fig. 16, an x–t diagram of the shock-tube experiment and comparisons of the calculated and measured temperatures behind the reflected shock wave are presented. In Fig. 16(a), it is shown that the incident shock wave is initially generated by the pressure difference between the driver and driven section after the diaphragm is ruptured and the reflected shock wave is generated again after the incident shock wave reaches the shock-tube end wall. Then, the dilute O_{2}–Ar mixture gas of the driven part is heated to 3000 K by the incident and reflected shock waves. In Fig. 16(b), the trans-rotational and electron-electronic-vibrational temperatures calculated by the 2-T model with the present thermochemical nonequilibrium parameters of O_{2} are compared with the measured vibrational temperatures behind the reflected shock wave. The measurements were carried out at the position of x = 980 mm, which is located 20 mm from the shock-tube end wall. Behind the incident shock wave, the electron-electronic-vibrational temperature of O_{2} slowly relaxes to the equilibrium conditions. After the reflected shock wave has passed, the electron-electronic-vibrational temperature appears to rapidly relax to a high-temperature condition owing to the shock-heated phenomena, and the calculated trans-rotational and electron-electronic-vibrational temperatures are approximately equal to the measured temperature values behind the reflected shock wave.
In Fig. 17, the shock-tube experiments by Matthews [34] are reproduced by the 2-T model with the present thermochemical nonequilibrium parameters of O_{2}. In the post-shock flow calculations of the shock velocity cases of 2.81 km/s and 3.36 km/s, it is shown that the electron-electronic-vibrational relaxation time of the shock velocity of 3.36 km/s is faster than that of the shock velocity of 2.81 km/s. Comparing the density ratio with the shock-tube experiments, all of the measured data are in the equilibrium region of the post-shock flows, and the 2-T model with the present thermochemical nonequilibrium parameters can reproduce the identical density changes behind the shock waves.
In the shock-tube experiments by Ibraguimova et_al [10], the vibrational temperature behind a shock wave was measured through absorption spectroscopy in the UV region of the Schumann–Runge bands. The measurements were carried out for the range of translational temperatures between 4000 and 10 400 K at the incident shock velocity between 3.07 and 4.44 km/s. In Fig. 18, the calculated electron-electronic-vibrational temperatures by the 2-T model are compared with the measured vibrational temperatures behind the incident shock waves. In the post-shock flow calculations by the 2-T model, the thermochemical nonequilibrium parameters of the present and previous datasets are employed to compare the availability. In the present work, the previous thermochemical nonequilibrium parameters proposed by Park [1,2] are adopted in these calculations. In the case of 3.07 km/s, the 2-T model with the present and previous parameters accurately reproduces the measured vibrational temperature profiles behind the shock wave. In the experimental cases of 3.95 and 4.44 km/s, discernible differences exist between the present and previous parameters. The electron-electronic-vibrational temperature calculated by the present parameters more slowly converges to the equilibrium state than that by the previous parameters. In comparison with the measured values, the present thermochemical nonequilibrium parameters can more accurately reproduce the vibrational temperature profile of the case of 4.44 km/s behind the strong shock waves than the previous parameters of O_{2}.
In Fig. 19, the results of the comparisons of the species concentrations behind a strong shock wave are shown for the cases of the shock-tube experiments by Ibraguimova et_al [10] The dissociation reactions of O_{2} calculated by the present thermochemical nonequilibrium parameters occur more slowly than the chemical reactions calculated by the previous parameters in the nonequilibrium region. The electron is produced from the associative ionization due to the collisions of the dissociated O, and the electron concentration calculated by the present thermochemical nonequilibrium parameters is almost twice as high as that of the previous parameters. This is because the trans-rotational temperature calculated by the present parameters is higher than the temperature calculated by the previous parameters at the region in which the nonequilibrium chemical reactions rapidly occur even though the extent of dissociation of O_{2} calculated by the present parameters is less than that calculated by the previous parameters.
V. 2D AXISYMMETRIC FLOW CALCULATION
The 2D axisymmetric flow calculations for a sphere geometry with a diameter of 20 cm are carried out. In the present work, the SHOCK2D code is employed to calculate the flow field. In SHOCK2D, the numerical part is extended from SHOCK1D to solve the 2D axisymmetric Navier–Stokes equations on unstructured quadrilateral computational grids with second-order spatial accuracy. The viscous terms are computed using cell-centered and nodal values. Unlike SHOCK1D, the implicit time integration by the point implicit method with first-order accuracy is adopted. The 2-T model with the present and previous thermochemical nonequilibrium parameters of O_{2} is employed to compare the results of the flow field due to the difference in the thermochemical nonequilibrium parameters. In the free stream conditions, pure O_{2} is employed with a density of 1.841 × 10^{−2} kg/m^{3}, and the velocities of 3 km/s–5 km/s are adopted. The boundary conditions used in the present work are the no-slip and non-catalytic conditions with a constant wall temperature of 300 K.
In Fig. 20, the computational mesh and the sample results of the pressure and trans-rotational temperature of the flow field are presented. In the present work, a total of 200 000 cells are generated, and 20 000 iterations are performed to obtain the steady-state conditions with a convergence residual of approximately 1.0 × 10^{−7}. The Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) number is increased with the step size of 0.01 until the maximum CFL number of 50, and the 2-T model with the present thermochemical nonequilibrium parameters is employed. In the sample axisymmetric calculations of a sphere geometry, the stagnation pressure is approximately 61 kPa, and the trans-rotational temperature is approximately 7000 K at the steady-state conditions of the free stream velocity of 4 km/s.
In Fig. 21, the temperatures and mass fraction along the stagnation line and the convective heat transfer rate along the sphere surface are presented for the free stream velocity of 3 km/s–5 km/s. In the case of 3 km/s, the amount of O_{2} dissociation is small enough to be ignored, and the differences in the temperatures and mass fractions between the present and previous thermochemical nonequilibrium parameters are also negligible. However, in the cases of 4 km/s and 5 km/s, the differences in the calculated results between the present and previous parameters are significant. For the temperatures, the maximum trans-rotational temperature calculated by the present thermochemical nonequilibrium parameters is higher than the temperature calculated by the previous parameters, and the shock stand-off distance is thicker than that by the previous parameters. The electron-electronic-vibrational relaxation of the present parameters occurs slowly in comparison with the results calculated by the previous parameters. For the chemical reactions, the rate of change of mass fraction calculated by the present thermochemical nonequilibrium parameters is slower than that by the previous parameters even though the trans-rotational and electron-electronic-vibrational temperatures are higher than those by the previous parameters. In comparison of the heat transfer rates on the surface, the convective heat transfer rates calculated by the present thermochemical nonequilibrium parameters are higher by 20%–30% than those of the previous parameters for the free stream velocity of 3 km/s–5 km/s.
VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
A modification of the thermochemical nonequilibrium parameters of O_{2} for the 2-T model is performed in the present work. In O_{2}, unlike the other atmospheric species, there exist three low-lying electronic states: X^{3}Σg−, a^{1}Δ_{g}, and b^{1}Σg+. The rovibrational nonequilibrium and coupled chemical reactions of these three low-lying electronic excited states are investigated in the 1D post-shock flow environments of dilute O_{2}–Ar mixtures, including the rovibrational state-to-state kinetics and electronic excitations due to heavy-particle collisions. In these state-resolved analyses of the dilute O_{2}–Ar mixtures for the shock velocity of 2–4 km/s, it is recognized that the rotational relaxation of O_{2} is fast enough to be treated as an equilibrium mode, and the vibration energy relaxations of the three low-lying electronic states of O_{2}(X^{3}Σg−, a^{1}Δ_{g}, b^{1}Σg+) are different from each other. However, the vibrational nonequilibrium and coupled chemical reactions of O_{2} behind a shock wave are mostly influenced by those of the electronic ground state because the electronic excitations due to heavy-particle collisions are not significant.
Based on the results of the present state-resolved analysis and the state-of-the-art shock-tube experimental data, the thermochemical nonequilibrium parameters of O_{2} are modified to improve the accuracy of the 2-T model. Vibrational relaxation parameters with a high-temperature correction term, reaction rate parameters of the Arrhenius-type equation, equilibrium constants for reverse chemical reactions, and vibrational energy-loss parameters for chemical reactions are proposed.
The 1D post-shock flow calculations using the proposed thermochemical nonequilibrium parameters of the 2-T model are carried out for pure O_{2} and O_{2}–Ar mixtures. Comparing the results calculated by the 2-T model with those by the state-resolved method, it is recognized that the nonvibrational diffusion and the preferential dissociation model can more accurately describe the thermochemical nonequilibrium of O_{2}. The geometrically averaged temperature of the 2-T model can capture the vibrational QSS of O_{2} in dissociation reactions, and it is enough to describe the nonequilibrium chemical reactions of O_{2}. In comparison with the shock-tube experimental data, the 2-T model with the present thermochemical nonequilibrium parameters of O_{2} can more accurately reproduce the existing shock-tube experimental data than the 2-T model with the previous parameters.
In 2D axisymmetric flow calculations, the discernible differences in the temperature profiles, mass fraction on the stagnation line, and heat transfer rate on the surface exist between the present and previous thermochemical nonequilibrium parameters for free stream velocities above 3 km/s.
