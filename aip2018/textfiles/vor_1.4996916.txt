Orbitally shaken shallow fluid layers. I. Regime classification
Orbital shakers are simple devices that provide mixing, aeration, and shear stress at multiple scales and high throughput. For this reason, they are extensively used in a wide range of applications from protein production to bacterial biofilms and endothelial cell experiments. This study focuses on the behaviour of orbitally shaken shallow fluid layers in cylindrical containers. In order to investigate the behaviour over a wide range of different conditions, a significant number of numerical simulations are carried out under different configuration parameters. We demonstrate that potential theory—despite the relatively low Reynolds number of the system—describes the free-surface amplitude well and the velocity field reasonably well, except when the forcing frequency is close to a natural frequency and resonance occurs. By classifying the simulations into non-breaking, breaking, and breaking with part of the bottom uncovered, it is shown that the onset of wave breaking is well described by Δh/(2R) = 0.7Γ, where Δh is the free-surface amplitude, R is the container radius, and Γ is the container aspect ratio; Δh can be well approximated using the potential theory. This result is in agreement with standard wave breaking theories although the significant inertial forcing causes wave breaking at lower amplitudes.
I. INTRODUCTION
An orbital shaker is an apparatus that is used extensively in laboratories to provide mixing, aeration, and shear stress to fluid-filled containers placed on top of it. Applications include drug production under biopharmaceutical protocols, which may range from simply mixing different components [1] to providing certain levels of shear to accelerate protein degradation [2]. Another use is animal cell cultivation in suspension, e.g., for the production of recombinant proteins [3] or cell mass production [4], which requires efficient mixing and aeration and controlling the levels of shear stress in the flow to avoid damaging the cells. Further, in the study of bacterial biofilms [5] or human stem cell cultures [6], orbital shakers are used to assess the dependence of cell proliferation on the shear stress exerted on the culture surface. Recently, orbital shakers have been used to study the role of shear stress in atherosclerosis, where there is a persistent debate on the correlation between the magnitude and directionality of the wall shear stress (WSS) and the physiological and pathological functions of the endothelial cells that line blood vessel walls [7–11]. In these orbital shaker experiments, cells are cultured at the bottom of a container with a fluid on top to provide oxygen, nutrients, and wall shear stress.
In orbital shaker studies that focus on the fluid dynamics [12,13], there is agreement on the need for a systematic approach to characterise the flow regimes and determine how the different operating parameters influence shear stress, mixing, and aeration. There are some thorough parametric studies regarding mixing [1], power input [14], and energy dissipation rates [15], the latter also including a study of oxygen transfer rates. Other studies characterise the free surface and the velocity fields: Kim and Kizito [16] remark on the importance of secondary flow in the mixing process and connect the height aspect ratio to the free surface deformation and the mean velocity; Weheliye, Yianneskis, and Ducci [17] describe this secondary flow as counter-rotating vortices, observing different vortical structures in different operating regimes, and derive various dimension scaling laws for the height amplitude; and Reclari et_al [13] study the occurrence of wave breaking in deep cylindrical containers and investigate mixing and aerations using particles trajectories as proxies.
An understanding of flow regimes starts with the identification of appropriate dimensionless groups. The configuration considered in this study consists of a cylindrical container filled with a shallow fluid layer and placed on top of a platform which translates (without any rotation) following an orbital trajectory [see Fig. 1(a)]. Ignoring surface tension effects, the problem has seven parameters [see Fig. 1(a)]: the fluid height at rest d, container radius R, the orbital forcing radius a, the angular forcing frequency ω, the fluid’s kinematic viscosity ν, the fluid’s density ρ, and the gravitational acceleration g. Various dimensionless groups have been identified in previous work [13,17,18], but here we start from the inviscid solutions (see Sec. II B for details), leading to
Here, F is the dimensionless forcing, E represents the eccentricity, Γ is the shallowness of the fluid layer, and Re is the Reynolds number. The advantage of starting from the inviscid solutions is that it guarantees the groups are the physically most meaningful ones. Table I shows the value of the dimensionless groups F, E, Γ, and Re for a large number of experimental, computational, and combined orbital shaker studies. Application areas include endothelial cells, bacterial biofilms, cells in suspension, stem cells, protein degradation, mixing, and aeration. In the endothelial cell studies, Γ is constrained by the availability of standard culture container sizes and the restrictions on the fluid height needed for aeration, operating typically in shallow water conditions (Γ < 1). Other applications explore multiple size containers and the aspect ratio Γ has a wider variability, especially in applications with cells in suspension, where there is an interest in scaling-up the problem to process larger volumes and no restriction on fluid height is imposed. The dimensionless forcing F can be varied over a continuum because orbital shakers allow tuning of the frequency over a given range. At high forcing, the container bottom can become exposed or shear can attain too high a level, which can damage the cells and proteins or prevent the cells from attaching to the base, placing an upper limit on the value of F. The eccentricity E typically takes discrete values because experiments are carried out using commercial orbital shakers that have a fixed orbital forcing radius a, with some exceptions [13,14,17]. The Reynolds number Re typically is low in endothelial cells, protein degradation, and stem cell applications (Re < 10^{4}) but increases notably in cells for suspension and mixing where larger containers are used. Table II shows that there is a wide spread in the dimensionless parameters used for the different applications.
The aim of this paper is to provide insight into the flow regimes that occur in orbital shakers with cylindricalcontainers at small Γ, i.e., shallow fluid layers. Shallow fluid layers are used in many laboratory experiments, and the correct operating parameters are often determined by trial and error. We hope that this work will make this process significantly easier. The regimes will be identified by carrying out a large number of numerical simulations with a wide range of flow behaviour at Γ = 0.18, which derives from typical cell culture parameters. We will show that for the portion of the parameter space covered, the effect of Re on velocity and free-surface elevation is limited, and the focus will be on an analysis of the E-F parameter space. In classifying the regimes, it turns out that the potential flow theory—despite not including any viscous effects—is a powerful tool that can be used to predict the liquid height amplitude. A further novelty is that the potential wave theory can be used to predict the onset of wave breaking.
The paper is organised as follows. In Sec. II, the governing equations and potential flow theory are described. Section III contains details of the numerical simulations and a description of the case studies. Section IV A explores the applicability of the inviscid potential flow solutions to the (viscid) simulations, and it will be demonstrated that the theory predicts the free-surface elevations excellently and the velocities reasonably for low-forcing cases. In Sec. IV B, the validity of the potential theory to predict height amplitude and phase shift is explored at higher forcing and for a wide range of E; values are well predicted except for cases with a shaking frequency close to resonance. In Sec. IV C, the effect of viscosity (Re)—not considered in the potential theory—is shown to be small. In Sec. IV D, all case studies are systematically analysed as a function of E and F, and a criterion for the onset of breaking is identified. The classification is validated using other studies reported in the literature in Sec. V, and good agreement is shown. Concluding remarks are made in Sec. VI.
II. GOVERNING EQUATIONS AND POTENTIAL THEORY
A. Governing equations
The liquid in the orbital shaker is assumed Newtonian and surface tension effects and shear stresses at the free surface are neglected, implying that the problem can be treated as a single phase system governed by the continuity and Navier-Stokes equations
where v represents the velocity vector, p is the pressure, ρ is the density, and f_{m} is the force per unit mass acting on the fluid. It is common to consider the problem in a non-inertial frame of reference [see Fig. 1(b)]. In this reference frame, the container is static, and the forces acting on the fluid are the time-dependent inertial force [38] and the gravitational acceleration
where (e_{x}, e_{y}, e_{z}) and (e_{r}, e_{θ}, e_{z}) are the unit vectors of the Cartesian and cylindrical coordinate systems in the non-inertial reference frame, respectively. No-slip boundary conditions are imposed on the sides and at the bottom of the cylinder, and the gas-liquid boundary is a free surface.
B. Potential flow theory
Analytical predictions of the free-surface elevation and the velocity field can be obtained by assuming that (1) the flow is irrotational; (2) the boundary conditions on the container wall are stress-free; and (3) the kinematic boundary condition at the free surface can be linearised [13,16,39]. By virtue of irrotationality, a flow potential Φ can be introduced which is linked to the velocity field by v = ∇Φ. The continuity equation (2) thus reduces to the Laplace equation ∇^{2}Φ = 0. The Laplace equation can be solved using separation of variables, and the solution consists of a series of modes in the radial (n) and tangential (m) directions and an exponential solution in the vertical direction [40]. For the solution used in this study, only the first non-axisymmetrical tangential mode (m = 1) is retained because it is the main mode excited by the lateral movement produced by the orbital shaker, leading to the following solution [13,39,41] in the non-inertial reference frame with origin at the center of the bottom wall and translating synchronously with the orbital shaker platform [Fig. 1(b)]
where Φ is the flow potential; ζ is the free-surface elevation relative to the static height d; r, θ, and z are the cylindrical coordinates; J_{1}(r) is the Bessel function of the first kind, of order 1; ϵ_{1n} is the n-th root of J1′(s) (where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to the argument); λ_{1n} = ϵ_{1n}/R; and ω_{1n} is the natural frequency of the mode (1, n) given by the dispersion relationship ω1n2=gλ_{1n}⁡tanh(λ_{1n}d). The value of ϵ_{1n} for the first five modes is 1.841, 5.331, 8.536, 11.706, and 14.864.
The solutions (5) and (6) can be made dimensionless by a change of variables r̃=r/R, z̃=z/R, and t̃=ωt, leading to
where the solution was expanded into its cylindrical velocity components {u_{r}, u_{θ}, u_{z}} using v = ∇Φ and the dimensionless groups are those introduced in (1), i.e.,
The dimensionless forcing F represents the ratio between the inertial force per unit mass and the gravitational acceleration. A physical interpretation of F is that it represents the inclination of a free surface at rest under the influence of the effective gravity f_{m}(4). The free surface will be perpendicular to f_{m}, implying that its slope angle α follows from the ratio of the inertial force and the gravitational force, i.e., tan α = aω^{2}/g = F (see Fig. 2). The eccentricity E represents the ratio between the orbital forcing radius a and the cylinder radius R; the name was chosen by analogy to the mathematical theory of conic sections. The shallowness Γ represents the ratio between the vertical and the horizontal scale of the static liquid volume, and as the name implies, it determines if the fluid is in the shallow or deep water regime. For completeness, we have added the Reynolds number Re to the dimensionless groups, which represents the ratio between the inertial force derived from the local acceleration and the viscous forces. This parameter does not feature in the potential flow solution because of the assumption of irrotationality.
Shown in Fig. 3 is the prediction from the potential theory (PT) of the dimensionless free-surface amplitude Δh^{PT}/(2R), where Δh^{PT} = max (ζ) − min (ζ) (7). The portion of the parameter space shown in Fig. 3 roughly covers those of the studies in Table I, with the shallowness Γ ranging from very shallow (Γ = 0.05) to moderately deep (Γ = 1). It is clear that the parameter space has a formidable complexity due to the resonant frequencies of the various wave modes (dark red regions), and it is thus not surprising that the flow structure in the orbital shaker experiments depends notably on the problem parameters [12,28–30,33,42].
III. SIMULATION DETAILS
The volume-of-fluid (VOF) two-phase solver of STAR-CCM+ (v.9; CD-adapco) was used to carry out all simulations. The time integration was implicit with a time step chosen suchthat the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy number (CFL) remained below 0.5; the time accuracy requirement is not due to the stability of the time-integration but is necessary for the correct functioning of the VOF scheme, which will lead to mass conservation issues otherwise.
The VOF scheme is an interface-capturing method [43] that tracks a surface tension free gas-liquid interface using a conservation equation for a scalar field c that represents the volume fraction of one of the phases. This allows the two fluid phases to be treated as a single-phase fluid where the density and dynamic viscosity attain a value depending on the value of c as given by ρ = ρ_{1}c + ρ_{2}(1 − c) and μ = μ_{1}c + μ_{2}(1 − c), where subscripts 1 and 2 indicate the two fluids. The free surface is defined as the isosurface where c = 0.5.
For this study, 33 numerical simulations were carried out, the parameters of which are displayed in Table II. The reference simulation Re4, which is motivated by experimental studies on the behaviour of endothelial cells in our laboratory, has parameters d = 2 mm, R = 11.05 mm, a = 5 mm, ω = 15.7 rad s^{−1}, ρ = 997.6 kg/m^{3}, and μ = 1.002 × 10^{−3} Pa s, which corresponds to F = 0.13, E = 0.45, Γ = 0.18, and Re = 1918. This is a strongly forced case, in which a travelling shock with substantial breaking is observed, which ensures proper aeration of the cells at the container bottom. This case has been rigorously validated in previous work [44], with particular emphasis on accurately capturing the free surface and the boundary layers. The details of the verification are presented in the Appendix. Fully converged results are observed for the mesh shown in Fig. 4, which is a cylindrical block structured with 291 600 cells.
The simulations were designed such that the mesh chosen for the reference simulation could be used for all other cases, which avoids having to remesh and carry out additional convergence studies. Thus, the shallowness Γ was kept constant at a value of 0.18 since its variation would require modifying R or d. By modifying the gravitational acceleration g—which is straightforward to do in computational studies—it was possible to vary the dimensionless group F while keeping the values of the other groups constant. Table II presents the parameter values for all simulations. Figure 5 demonstrates the portion of the E-F phase space covered by the simulations.
The simulations have been grouped into sets, the names reflecting the dimensionless groups that vary in the set:
• Re cases: vary Re with respect to the reference case;
• EF cases: vary E and F with respect to the reference case, keeping constant the ratio E/F = 0.36;
• E cases: vary E with respect to the reference case;
• Fl, Fm, and Fh cases: vary F at different values of constant E (low, medium, high); and
• L cases are low-forcing cases (F ≪ 1), where Re, E, and F vary simultaneously. These cases were carried out to compare the (viscous) simulations with the (inviscid) potential theory in the linear regime, results of which will be discussed in Sec. IV A.
For the analysis of the simulations, the transients during which the flow adjusts into its forced response are removed. The transient period usually takes about 4–5 orbits (see also Fig. 7). In the fully developed forced solution, the spatial profiles of velocity and free-surface elevation remain constant and are rotating with an angular velocity ω; thus, a single snapshot at t mod 2π/ω = 0 provides all the required information. An impression of the large variety in observed fluid behaviour is shown in Fig. 6, which displays the free-surface elevation as a function of E and F; the behaviour varies from cases simply showing a flat tilted free surface to others showing multiple crests, wave breaking, and some extreme cases with part of the bottom of the container exposed.
IV. RESULTS
A. Validation of potential theory
The aim of this section is to verify the extent to which the potential theory can describe flow behaviour in orbitally shaken shallow fluid layers in cylindrical containers. Indeed, as Re is relatively low for many studies (Table II), it is not unreasonable to ask to what extent the inviscid theory can describe the fluid behaviour. For this reason, we will consider low-forcing F cases (L cases), where one could expect linear theory to be valid.
Figure 7 displays the mean velocity at the free surface as a function of time for case L5. Simulations were started from a static state at t = 0, and the sudden acceleration excites multiple modes. For an inviscid fluid, these modes would remain in existence indefinitely, but viscous effects will damp all the initial modes until only the forced response of the system remains. As can be seen in Fig. 7, this state is reached approximately within four shaking periods. All data presented in the remainder of this section are taken from the forced response. Figure 8 shows the maps of height and velocity magnitude at z = 1 mm for L5 at t = 6T (T is the rotation period 2π/ω); the height map is well characterised, and the elliptic shape of the velocity is well predicted by the potential model at the bulk of the liquid, but there is a discrepancy in the velocity scale. (Similar results are observed in the other L cases.) Also noticeable are the differences in the velocity field close to the side boundaries which are affected by viscous effects. Here, the effect of viscosity is that the maximum shear, which occurs near the wall, lags with respect to the potential flow prediction.
The free-surface elevation amplitude and maximum and mean velocity are summarised in Table III for all L cases, as well as the expectations from the potential theory. The free-surface elevation agrees within 1% for all cases, while there is a discrepancy in the velocity fields: the maximum velocity is consistently underestimated by 20%, and the mean velocity is underestimated with a discrepancy that ranges from 10% (lower F) to 5% (higher F). We also carried out simulation L5 with free-slip boundary conditions (case L5FS in Table III), but apart from requiring much longer to damp all initial modes except the forced solution (over 40 oscillations), both velocity and free-surface amplitude are indistinguishable from the no-slip case (besides the boundary layer at the walls). We thus conclude that the differences in the velocity amplitudes are due to viscous effects in the bulk of the liquid.
The discrepancies between the simulations and the potential theory can be understood using the conservation of mechanical energy. This equation can be derived from the momentum equation, and it represents the balance between the time rate-of-change in kinetic energy and the work done per unit time by the surface and volume forces. Making use of the periodicity of the movement and taking into account other properties of the problem under consideration (see Alpresa [45] for the derivation), the mechanical energy equation can be reduced to a balance between the viscous dissipation rate and the work per unit time done by the inertial forces
where V(t) is the integration volume and τ^{′}¯¯ is the deviatoric stress tensor defined by
where μ is the dynamic viscosity and I is the identity matrix.
The dissipation rate function (τ^{′}¯¯:∇v) is always positive, i.e., there is always a loss of mechanical energy that is transformed into internal energy. For the potential flow theory, τ^{′}¯¯=0 by definition due to the assumption of irrotationality. Thus, there is no viscous dissipation and the velocity field must be such that the work done by the inertial force is zero (∫_{V(t)}ρf_{i} · vdΩ = 0). Indeed, the dot product of the inertial force (4) and the velocity (8) must cancel out in the fluid volume at each instant of time. This is indeed the case for the potential flow because the trigonometric functions in the velocity field ensure that work is zero upon integration over the volume. As was argued before, Fig. 8(c) displays a phase shift in the velocity field close to the side boundaries, consistent with the arguments above.
The potential theory has been demonstrated to predict the free-surface elevation accurately while underestimating the velocity field. The conservation of energy sheds light on the origin of the discrepancies in the velocity scales. The viscosity term introduces a fundamental difference between the two models: the viscous dissipation rate causes an unavoidable loss of mechanical energy in the viscous problem, which leads to a different distribution of the fluid field to the inviscid problem. Equation (10) shows that the term feeding the viscous dissipation is the work per unit time done by the inertial forces. We note two possible origins of this work: a symmetry breaking of the velocity magnitude field and a lag between the volume and velocity field symmetry planes. Further analysis is beyond the scope of this study.
B. Free-surface amplitude and phase shift
Having established that the potential theory describes the free-surface elevation well for situations with low dimensionless forcing F, we study the extent to which the theory describes cases with high F. We will use the E cases to explore the predictions for highly forced cases, in which F is large but constant and the eccentricity E varies in a range of two orders of magnitude (see Table II). An attractive feature of this simulation set is that it crosses a resonant line between E1 and E2.
In the potential theory, the maximum free-surface elevation occurs at r = R, θ = 0 and the minimum at r = R, θ = π (with identical deviation from the static height d) in all E cases at t mod 2π/ω = 0, with the exception of E1 for which the higher modes are of such magnitude that they change the location of the maximum. Therefore, the amplitude Δh^{PT} is given by
predicting a dependence of Δh^{PT}2R on F, EF, and Γ.
Shown in Fig. 9(a) are the amplitudes Δh/2R as observed in the E cases as a function of ω_{11}ω=EFϵ_{11}⁡tanh(ϵ_{11}Γ), a non-dimensional number proportional to E^{1/2}. The potential model prediction, as indicated by the dashed line, estimates the height amplitude correctly except for the cases E2 and E3; in these cases, the shaking frequencies approach the resonant frequency, where the potential model predicts an infinite amplitude due to the absence of viscosity.
Another characteristic observed in crossing the resonant line is that the location of the maximum free-surface elevation shifts from an angle 0° to π° in the x-axis direction. The indicator phase shift φ has been defined as the angle between the line connecting the centre of the container with the maximum free-surface height and the direction of the inertial force (φ ∈ [− π, π]). Figure 9(b) shows φ as a function of ω_{11}ω for all case studies. The potential theory predicts very well the change in the indicator by π when crossing the first natural frequency ω_{11} of the mode m = 1 (Fl cases and E1). The prediction differs somewhat for cases at ω ∼ ω_{11}, which is expected becauseviscous effects will create strong differences near the resonance frequency.
C. Effect of Reynolds number
As observed by Reclari [41], increasing the viscosity (Re ↓) decreases the area of the breaking regions (see Fig. 10); however, contrary to what they observed in breaking waves, the amplitude decreases with viscosity. The change in the amplitude is small (difference ∼10% between Re1 and Re5), but the tendency is to initially increase with Re, and later the amplitude remains the same for Re4 and Re5. Their arguments are (1) that viscosity increases the resistance to agitation when the wave is not breaking, thereby decreasing the amplitude; and (2) that viscosity reduces the area of dissipation of energy when the wave is breaking thereby increasing the amplitude [41]. We argue that a combination of both phenomena takes place when the wave is breaking, resulting in a small change in the amplitude.
The phase shift φ, defined in Sec. IV B, remains practically constant at −10°; however, the position of the minimum free-surface height varies from +140° to +80° with increasing viscosity. We leave this finding as an observation, considering that it would be necessary to undertake an in-depth study of the structure of the velocity secondary flows to explain this effect and indicating its possible connection to the effect of dissipation of mechanical energy introduced in Sec. IV A.
D. Transition to breaking
In this section, we will focus on regime classification, making use of the fact that the potential theory provides a good description of the expected free-surface elevation with the exception of cases in which the system is close to resonance. In particular, we will describe a criterion for wave breaking.
The closest study of wave breaking in orbitally shaken cylindrical fluid layers was carried out by Reclari et_al [13], who found that potential theory predicted the free-surface amplitude accurately for single crested non-breaking waves. Their experimental observations show a change of behaviour when the wave breaks; this change occurs at amplitudes Δh2R between 0.35 and 0.45. They argue that the theory of gravity waves establishes a limit in the wave steepness beyond which nogravity waves can exist and breaking is expected; in the context of the orbital shaker, this limit translates to Δh2R≅0.443, supporting their findings. However, this result is not valid in the study of small Γ, where the wave is expected to be perturbed if Δh2R>2d2R=Γ (uncovered bottom), e.g., in this study if Δh2R>0.18. Indeed, the literature on wave-breaking typically distinguishes between breaking in shallow and deep water [46].
In shallow water, many studies are inspired by the criterion established by Miche [47] for one-dimensional, periodic, irrotational waves over a flat bottom given by H_{max}=β_{max}κtanh(κd), where H_{max} is the maximum height measured from the static height d, κ is the wavenumber, and β_{max} = 0.88 is a constant. In the current work, this implies H_{max}=Δh2, κ=2πL=2π2πR=1/R, and thus the breaking criterion for shallow water is Δh2R=β_{max}Γ. This theory can be used as a reference in shallow water given that the way in which the wave breaks is similar to that of a solitary wave [46], but β_{max} need not be 0.88 in this problem due to the inertial forces and the fact that the Reynolds number is limited. The Miche criterion is derived from the fact that wave breaking takes place when the particle velocity approaches or reaches the phase velocity v_{p}, which translates in the orbital shaker problem considered herein into the breaking criterion v_{max}∼v_{p}, where v_{max} is the maximum velocity at the free surface, v_{p} = r_{p}ω, and r_{p} is the radial distance of the location of maximum free-surface velocity.
Similar to Reclari et_al’s findings [13], we observed that the potential theory predicted the amplitude correctly up to the forcing value where breaking is predicted. This analysis has been carried out in the simulation sets where Δh^{PT}2R(12) only depends on F, i.e., in Fl, m, h cases and also EF cases since EF is constant. In these cases, there is thus a unique positive correspondence between the predicted amplitude and the forcing. This allows the definition of two analytical limits: (i) the uncovered-bottom forcing F_{u} when the amplitude prediction is equal to double the static height Δh2R=Γ, then for F > F_{u} the bottom would be uncovered and the analytical prediction is not physical; and (ii) the breaking forcing F_{b} when the dimensionless amplitude prediction is equal to the theoretical prediction of breaking Δh2R=0.88Γ, then for F > F_{b} the wave is expected to break. (Note that F_{u} and F_{b} change in each simulation set, and that F_{b} < F_{u} always.) Figure 11 shows the amplitude over the potential amplitude against the forcing non-dimensionalised by F_{b}. There, it is observed that for cases with F < 0.9F_{b}, there is a discrepancy of under 10% in the potential prediction, while for cases with F > F_{b}, the potential model overestimates the amplitude.
All cases have been classified visually in the simulations as breaking or non-breaking based on the presence of the height discontinuity in the free surface, and as covered or uncovered bottom based on the number of vertical computational cells at the lowest point of the free surface (see Fig. 12). Cases withF>F_{b} are observed to be indeed breaking, and thus the reduced amplitude with respect to the prediction is explained by the dissipation of energy due to the breaking. The exceptions are the Fl cases, where the prediction is not accurate even in the non-breaking cases; in this simulation set, the first symmetric mode is not predominant, and the potential theory predicts the predominance of the second symmetric mode. However, while this is true, contrary to the potential prediction, the solution is clearly not antisymmetric: ζ_{max} > ζ_{min}, probably due to the excitation of other modes not contemplated in the potential model used. On the other hand, no analytical conclusions can be drawn with respect to the uncovered bottom limit because the validity domain of the potential theory reaches its limit at F = F_{b}, thus at F < F_{u}.
In Figs. 13(a) and 13(b), all case studies have been plotted in diagrams of dimensionless amplitude Δh2R against the maximum free-surface velocity over the phase velocity v_{max}v_{p}. In Fig. 13(a), the points have been coloured according to the simulation set colour codes given in Fig. 5 and can be linked to the bottom figures [Fig. 13(c)] which represent the height maps arranged left to right from the lowest to highest amplitude within each simulation set. Therein, the two black discontinuous lines represent the two theoretical breaking limits for amplitude and velocity: Δh2R=0.88Γ and v_{max}=v_{p}. InFig. 13(b), the same figure has been represented colour-coded based on the non-breaking/breaking and uncovered/covered-bottom classification. The axes are the same in both top figures; therefore, the points can be connected one-to-one and also linked to the height maps. We observe that the breaking occurs before the theoretical limit of solitary waves Δh2R=0.88Γ, and the breaking limit for this problem has been identified at Δh2R=0.7Γ. Interestingly, the maximum velocity in the breaking cases has a common tendency to ∼1.3v_{p} (EF5 seems to be outside the rule presumably because the maximum velocity is no longer at the breaking of the wave but has extended over the free surface, affecting the definition of v_{p} through r_{p}).
All observations come together in Fig. 14. There, all case studies have been plotted in the E-F space and colour-coded based on the non-breaking/breaking and uncovered/covered-bottom classification. In addition, each point in the E-F space corresponds to a unique value of the potential theory height amplitude Δh^{PT} = ζ_{max} − ζ_{min}(6) with Γ = 0.18, as was shown in Fig. 3 for multiple Γ. The latter allows drawing of the breaking limit identified as the curve where Δh^{PT}2R=0.7Γ (red line), the potential prediction of uncovered bottom as the curve where Δh^{PT}2R=Γ (grey line), and the resonance lines as the curve where EFϵ_{1n}⁡tanh(ϵ_{1n}Γ)=ω1nω{2}=1 (discontinuous black lines). Theses lines separate the E-F space into multiple regions. The wave-breaking regime region corresponds to the marked (striped) area, which is limited by the breaking threshold Δh^{PT}2R>0.7Γ, and all cases that fall in this region are expected to have a breaking wave. Indeed, the breaking threshold adequately separates the cases in non-breaking and breaking regimes with the exception of the Fl cases, where, as previously noted, the potential theory model used in this study does not predict the amplitude accurately. The predicted uncovered-bottom line does not delimit a region where the cases have uncovered bottom. As previously remarked, this is due to the fact that the wave breaks before it reaches the uncovered-bottom amplitude threshold, and the potential theory fails to predict the amplitude in the breaking regime.
V. COMPARISON WITH OTHER STUDIES
In this section, we will verify whether the regime classification proposed in the previous section is consistent with the literature. The endothelial cells studies summarised in Table I have been plotted in the E-F space for an approximated value of Γ (Fig. 15). These plots show a similar configuration to Fig. 14: the breaking limit is represented by the red lines where Δh^{PT}2R=0.7Γ, the potential prediction of uncovered bottom by the grey lines where Δh^{PT}2R=Γ, and the resonance lines by discontinuous black lines where EFϵ_{1n}⁡tanh(ϵ_{1n}Γ)=ω1nω{2}=1; therefore, the breaking-wave regime corresponds to the region delimited by the breaking limit containing the resonant lines (area on the right-hand side). All cases operate in the shallow water regime (Γ < 1), and most cases operate beyond the identified breaking limit Δh2R=0.7Γ. All computational studies report the travelling wave [12,27–31,33,34], but they do not analyse the occurrence of wave breaking. Only Salek, Sattari, and Martinuzzi [12] show the height maps of their cases, which corroborate our results: the two reported cases at Γ = 0.12 [green triangles in Fig. 15(a)] are beyond the breaking limit in the E-F space, and their height maps clearly show a breaking region. Their case at Γ = 0.24 and F = 0.11 [green triangle on the leftside in Fig. 15(b)] is located in the non-breaking region in the E-F space, and the height map shows an almost flat free surface with an incipient breaking, similar to our cases Fh2 and E5. Their case at Γ = 0.24 and F = 0.42 [green triangle on the right side in Fig. 15(b)] is located in the breaking region close to a resonant line, and the height map shows a breaking region of long radial length and a partially uncovered bottom.
VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS
Using a combination of potential theory and numerical simulations, we have shed light on the characterisation of the flow by carrying out a regime classification. This classification is based on the onset of wave breaking, which is crucial to the character of τ_{w} in orbital shakers.
Our initial consideration of the potential theory as a model for this forced free-surface flow leads to the identification of four dimensionless groups that are key to classifying the case studies (Table II). These dimensionless groups are (i) the dimensionless forcing F, (ii) the eccentricity E, (iii) the shallowness Γ, and (iv) the Reynolds number Re (the latter does not feature in the PT solution because of the assumption of irrotationality but it has been added for completeness). In this study, we focussed on the shallow water regime typically adopted in endothelial studies by setting Γ = 0.18. We demonstrate that, in spite of the simplified linear and inviscid potential theory used, the analytical solution predicts the amplitude correctly up to the onset of breaking. This allows for delimiting theoretically a breaking region in the E-F space (Fig. 14) based on the breaking threshold Δh2R=0.7Γ identified observationally in the simulations (Fig. 13), which is specific for shallow water. The classification is valid for the wide range of behaviour observed in the case studies. The prediction did not hold for the cases where the second modes became dominant, opening the way for improvement of the potential theory.
Using the regime classification, it is possible to identify regimes suitable for experimentation a priori. For example, for the case of endothelial cell experiments, (i) select a region around the breaking threshold which should provide a rich environment to experiment with different WSS patterns depending on the geometry of the free-surface breaking area and (ii) keep away from the resonant lines and areas of higher free-surface amplitude as this can lead to the bottom of the container becoming uncovered, and hence to cell damage.
In Paper II [48], we will use the potential flow theory to investigate the wall shear stress τ_{w} distributions and its relation to the regime classification identified in this study.
APPENDIX: VALIDATION OF COMPUTATIONAL MODEL
A convergence study was carried out to validate the computational model, ensuring that the results were mesh-independent. Multiple indicators (WSS, velocity, amplitude, and kinetic energy) were compared in meshes from about 40 K to 1000 K cells (Fig. 16). Although coarser meshes yielded similar results, the number of elements used for this study was 291 600 in order to have high resolution near the wall. The fluid is set in motion from a static position and experiences a transient state before it reaches periodic motion. The observation over time of the indicators allows the analysis of the transient state; most cases reached a constant value after about three rotations (Fig. 16 shows the reference case where T = 0.4 s), and some rare cases after about eight rotations. All cases were run for eleven rotations and analysed between the tenth and eleventh rotations to ensure stability unless otherwise specified.
To further validate the computational model, we have compared results in a configuration case presented in Salek, Sattari, and Martinuzzi [12] with parameters R = 17.5 mm, d = 2.08 mm, ω = 10.5 rad s^{−1}, a = 9.5 mm, μ = 10^{−3} Pa s, and ρ = 998 kg m^{−3}. Their results were obtained in the commercial CFD software FLUENT with a block-structured cylindrical mesh of 64 000 computational cells, and validated with experimental measurements of height, velocity, and WSS. Figure 17 shows a comparison between Salek’s and our computational model for the free surface and the bottom WSS maps. Both sets of maps are in agreement. Small discrepancies can be observed between the WSS maps: in Salek’s, the green area (WSS ∼ 0.5 Pa) extends up to the boundaries in the top right of the container bottom [Fig. 17(c)], whereas in our model, the WSS value is close to zero at all boundaries around the container bottom [Fig. 17(d)]. We argue that our solution gives the WSS value expected at the cylinder corner since velocities must be zero at the vertical wall and speculate that the difference is caused by discrepancies in the imposition of the no-slip boundary conditions between our model and Salek’s. Figure 18 shows the time-averaged WSS (TAWSS) and the maximum WSS (maxWSS) over a cycle as a function of the radialdistance. The differences are within the uncertainty of the experimental WSS measurements (10%), except around the maximum value of the maxWSS, which is the most sensitive value to the WSS discrepancies described at the boundaries.
