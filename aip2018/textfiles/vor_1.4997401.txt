Coarse-grained model of nanoscale segregation, water diffusion, and proton transport in Nafion membranes
We present a coarse-grained model of the acid form of Nafion membrane that explicitly includes proton transport. This model is based on a soft-core bead representation of the polymer implemented into the dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulation framework. The proton is introduced as a separate charged bead that forms dissociable Morse bonds with water beads. Morse bond formation and breakup artificially mimics the Grotthuss hopping mechanism of proton transport. The proposed DPD model is parameterized to account for the specifics of the conformations and flexibility of the Nafion backbone and sidechains; it treats electrostatic interactions in the smeared charge approximation. The simulation results qualitatively, and in many respects quantitatively, predict the specifics of nanoscale segregation in the hydrated Nafion membrane into hydrophobic and hydrophilic subphases, water diffusion, and proton mobility. As the hydration level increases, the hydrophilic subphase exhibits a percolation transition from a collection of isolated water clusters to a 3D network of pores filled with water embedded in the hydrophobic matrix. The segregated morphology is characterized in terms of the pore size distribution with the average size growing with hydration from ∼1 to ∼4 nm. Comparison of the predicted water diffusivity with the experimental data taken from different sources shows good agreement at high and moderate hydration and substantial deviation at low hydration, around and below the percolation threshold. This discrepancy is attributed to the dynamic percolation effects of formation and rupture of merging bridges between the water clusters, which become progressively important at low hydration, when the coarse-grained model is unable to mimic the fine structure of water network that includes singe molecule bridges. Selected simulations of water diffusion are performed for the alkali metal substituted membrane which demonstrate the effects of the counter-ions on membrane self-assembly and transport. The hydration dependence of the proton diffusivity reproduces semi-qualitatively the trend of the diverse experimental data, showing a sharp decrease around the percolation threshold. Overall, the proposed model opens up an opportunity to study self-assembly and water and proton transport in polyelectrolytes using computationally efficient DPD simulations, and, with further refinement, it may become a practical tool for theory informed design and optimization of perm-selective and ion-conducting membranes with improved properties.
I. INTRODUCTION
Among proton conducting polyelectrolyte membranes (PEMs), Nafion is the oldest, the best known, and the most thoroughly studied. Nafion polymer in acid form is widely used as perm-selective conductive membranes in various electrochemical technologies, including fuel cells, while metal substituted membranes are explored as diffusion protection barriers against chemical warfare agents and toxic industrial chemicals [1]. Composed of hydrophobic perfluorocarbon backbone and sidechains terminated by hydrophilic sulfonate groups, Nafion segregates upon hydration and self-assembles onto 3D interwoven structures composed of organic hydrophobic and proton-conducting hydrophilic subphases. The engineering properties of Nafion membranes, including water permeability, perm-selectivity, and proton conductivity, depend on the specifics of nanophase segregation morphology. The main objective of this work is to develop a coarse-grained model of Nafion capable of predicting the geometrical properties of hydrated Nafion membranes and their transport properties.
Nafion segregation morphology was studied by a variety of experimental methods [2]. It is assumed to be irregular, and the estimated spatial scale varies significantly between the methods and models applied. The transport properties of Nafion, including proton conductivity, are determined by both the local interactions (that is, molecular level arrangement of sulfonate groups and water molecules) and the overall segregation morphology. The interconnection of physico-chemical and geometrical factors poses a complex multiscale problem that attracted a great deal of theoretical modeling and molecular simulation efforts. Ab initio and atomistic simulations helped understand the specifics of backbone sulfonate group solvation by water and other solvents, as well as proton transfer mechanisms in solvated Nafion (e.g., Refs [3–13]). Classical atomistic MC simulations of PEM allowed calculations of water sorption isotherms [14,15]. Proton models such as EVB (empirical valence bond) [16] qualitatively expanded the capabilities of classical MD in studying PEM. However, computational expenses limit the available system size so it only incorporates several water clusters with EVB [16,17], and even with simpler models like in Ref [18] the cost of direct simulations of conductivity in Nafion seems to be prohibitive, despite ample computer resources and advances of simulation techniques [8]. Segregation morphology was in the focus of mesoscale modeling, where several atoms are “lumped together” and presented by a single quasiparticle or “bead.” Coarse-grained MD simulations [19–25] commonly use hard-core potentials (such as Lennard-Jones) and explored interfaces between Nafion and solid surfaces [20,23], effect of stretching [19], mechanical strength [25], and inclusion of other compounds such as ionic liquids [26]. In dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) [27], interactions between the beads are soft and short-ranged. The simplest approach to DPD simulations of polyelectrolytes is accounting for electrostatic interactions implicitly, by adjusting short-range parameters. This approach was fruitful in describing the evolution of Nafion nanostructures with hydration levels (e.g., Refs [22] and  [28–32]). Eliott et_al [33] combined DPD results with experimental small-angle X-ray/neutron scattering (SAXS/SANS) studies using a novel model-independent procedure. The modeling revealed a multi-level membrane organization, with hydrophilic—hydrophobic segregation on smaller and larger scales. This result is consistent with previous NMR studies [34,35]. Water diffusion coefficients were calculated indirectly, using random walks (RWs) within the aqueous subphase mapped onto a lattice [30]. DPD simulations of PEM with explicitly modeled electrostatic interactions became possible thanks to the smeared charge approximation [36]. In our earlier work [37], we developed a DPD model of the metal-substituted Nafion polymer and studied thermodynamic and transport properties of the membrane at different equivalent molecular weights and solvation levels. Water sorption isotherms were calculated with the Widom test particle method [38] and gave reasonable estimates for the maximum water uptake by Nafion polymers. The random walk method applied to digitized snapshots generated in DPD simulations reasonably reproduced the mobility of water in hydrated potassium-substituted Nafion. It should be mentioned that the current smeared charge models have essentially no sensitivity to the chemistry of the cation (beyond the charge) and the DPD applicability to studies of the role of cation remains limited.
The proton mobility in coarse-grained models of PEMs has been studied indirectly: DPD was applied to generate the segregation structure, and then proton diffusion in that structure was considered separately. In particular, Jorn and Voth [39] modeled the segregation in Nafion with DPD and calculated proton conductivity using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics approach, based on local concentration and charge densities in the resulting structures. The calculated conductivities showed a reasonable agreement with experimental data, within a factor of 2 at higher hydration. Recently, we introduced the proton transport directly into DPD simulations: proton is modeled as a special bead that forms dissociable Morse bonds with base beads (water and sulfonates) and thus is able to “hop” between the bases artificially mimicking the Grotthuss mechanism [40]. By fitting the Morse parameters to hydrogen self-diffusion in water and dissociation constant of benzenesulfonic acid, we studied segregation morphology and water and proton mobility in hydrated sulfonated polystyrene (sPS) at different hydration and sulfonation levels [41]. Considering the crudeness of coarse-grained representation, DPD simulations with the suggested proton model reproduced the experimental results quite well.
In this work, we present a new coarse-grained model to study self-assembly, water diffusion, and proton transport in hydrated Nafion membranes and compare the simulated results with the available experimental data from different literature sources. The proposed model is distinguished by direct consideration of proton transport by mimicking both vehicular and hopping mechanisms and the electrostatic interactions using the smeared charge approximation. The model is parameterized to mimic Nafion in the acid form and implemented into the DPD simulation framework. With this model, we are not only able to consistently reproduce the known qualitative features of the evolution of the Nafion morphology and variation of membrane permeability and conductivity upon hydration but also to provide a quantitative account of these features and shed light on the specifics of self-assembly and transport in hydrated membranes. In particular, we present a detailed quantified characterization of (a) Nafion segregated morphology considering hydrated membrane as a porous medium composed by water channels (pores) embedded in a hydrophilic matrix and calculating by the Connolly surface method the pore size distributions (PSDs), which evolve in the process of hydration, (b) effects of dynamic percolation on water and proton diffusion by comparing the static and dynamic methods, which are found to be very significant at low hydration, (c) importance of the hopping mechanism of proton transport compared to the vehicular mechanism, (d) difference of transport properties of acid and metal-substituted forms of Nafion, and (e) correlation of the simulated water and proton diffusivities with the experimental data taken from different sources.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Sec. II describes the proposed DPD model and the simulations focusing on the electrostatic interactions treated in smeared charge approximation, the force field for DPD simulations, and the proton model. In Sec. III, we analyze the evolution of nanoscale segregation upon hydration and quantify the morphology of the aqueous subphase in terms of the pore size distributions. Sections IV and V are devoted to modeling water and proton diffusion. The water and proton mobilities are studied both at static conditions, with the random walk method on quenched digitized copies of DPD generated segregated morphologies and at dynamic conditions, by monitoring mean square displacement (MSD) of water and proton beads along simulation trajectories. Special attention is paid to the analysis of static and dynamic percolation effects and their influence on the transport properties of water and protons. Selected simulations of water diffusion are performed for alkali metal substituted membranes. We perform a critical review of the experimental data on water and proton transport in Nafion and compare the simulation results with experimental data from different literature sources. Conclusions are summarized in Sec. VI.
II. MODEL AND SIMULATION DETAILS
A. DPD simulations
We employed the conventional DPD scheme with the particles interacting via pairwise conservative soft repulsive Fij(C)(r_{ij}), bond Fij(B)(r_{ij}), and electrostatic Fij(E)(r_{ij}) forces, as well as random Fij(R)(r_{ij}) and velocity dependent drag Fij(D)(r_{ij},v_{ij}) forces,
All beads are assigned an equal effective diameter R_{c}. The soft repulsion force Fij(C) acts between overlapping beads,
where a_{IJ} is the repulsion parameter specific to given bead pair of types I and J. Following the standard approach to DPD simulations of self-assembly [42], the effective bead diameter R_{c} and intra-component repulsion parameters a_{II} between beads of the same type (except the proton P bead that will be discussed in Sec. II D) are set equal, irrespective of the bead type. The Langevin thermostat is maintained by applying the random and drag forces, acting between overlapping beads along the vector r_{ij} connecting the bead centers with the dissipative parameter of γ = 4.5, commonly used in DPD simulations of aqueous systems.
The chain beads are connected by harmonic bonds Fij(B)(r_{ij})=K_{b}(r_{0}−r_{ij})r_{ij}/r_{ij}, where K_{b} is the bond rigidity and r_{0} is the equilibrium bond length. Following our recent papers [43], in addition to this nearest neighbor (1-2) bond, we introduced the second neighbor (1-3) bonds to control the chain flexibility. The electrostatic interactions are modeled using the smeared charge approach with the Slater-type charge density distribution with an exponential decay [44],fr=qπλ^{3}exp−2rr_{e}, where r_{e} is the effective smearing radius. The electrostatic force Fij(E) between charged particles i and j in Eq. (1) is expressed as
At the long range, the electrostatic interaction of smeared charges [Eq. (3)] reduces to the Coulomb potential and the standard Ewald summation [45] is used to account for the periodic boundary conditions. The choice of the smearing radius r_{e} = 0.25R_{c} for all charged beads was made due to technical reasons, as described in the supplementary material of Ref [46].
B. Coarse-graining
Choosing the level of coarse-graining and determining the parameters of coarse-grained potentials, we followed the scale-bridging methodology suggested in Refs [40] and  [47]. Since DPD coarse-graining is restricted to the same effective diameter R_{c} for all types of beads, we dissected Nafion into fragments of comparable size (Fig. 1). The selected fragments are modeled by 3 beads types: perfluoroalkane C type, perfluoroether E type, and sulfonate S type. The Nafion backbone is presented as a chain of C beads, which describe perfluoropolyethylene monomers –(CF_{2})_{2}–. The sidechain is presented by four beads: perfluoroether fragment modeled as a –EE– bead dimer and deprotonated sulfonate group modeled as a single S bead are separated by perfluoroalkane C bead. The fragment volumes were estimated from the reference functional group volumes used in group contribution thermodynamic models [48] and obtained in calculations with conductor-like screening solvation model (COSMO) [49] performed using PQS ab initio [50] software. Calculations of the fragment volume and exact mapping of atoms onto the beads are shown in Sec. S-I of the supplementary material.
To match the volume of polymer beads, the solvent bead W represents three water molecules that correspond to the effective bead size of R_{c} = 0.65 nm estimated from the bulk density of liquid water [42]. This is a finer level of coarse-graining than that (0.74 nm) used in our previous DPD simulation of a metal-substituted form of Nafion [37]. The selected level of coarse-graining is consistent with that used earlier for explicit modeling of proton transport in DPD simulation of sPS [41]. The mass of perfluoroalkane skeleton bead (100g/mol) was taken as a unit of mass (m_{W} = 1), the masses of all other beads were scaled accordingly. The intracomponent self-repulsion parameter a_{II} that controls the repulsion between like beads in Eq. (2) is set to 78kT/R_{c} that reproduces the bulk water compressibility for given R_{c} [47,51]. The Nafion membrane was presented by an ensemble of oligomers of 20 monomer unit each. Thus, each oligomer had 20 sidechains and 160 C beads in the skeleton, corresponding to an equivalent weight (EW) of 1195 Da (slightly higher than the standard EW, for the chemical formula of the considered Nafion monomer shown in Fig. 1 has an odd number of carbon atoms in the skeleton, in accord with the adopted coarse-graining scheme). All monomers were identical, neighboring sidechains were spaced at regular intervals separated by 8 skeleton beads, neglecting the irregular sidechain distribution in the actual Nafion polymer that may influence the structure and water transport [52].
C. DPD force field
The values of the model parameters are given in Table I.
The bond potential parameters (1-2 and 1-3 bond lengths r_{0} and stiffness K_{B}) were fitted to atomistic MD simulations of the molecules that contain the respective fragments. We used MD simulations of Ref [37] and refitted the bond parameters for finer coarse-graining of R_{c} = 0.65 nm that we use here. The parameters for the backbone bonds were fitted to match the probability density distribution of distances between DPD beads of C_{4} tetramer and the centers of mass of corresponding fragments of liquid perfluorooctane (see Sec. S-II of the supplementary material). The water–backbone repulsion parameter a_{CW} = 114.5 kT/R_{c} was determined from the best match to the mutual solubilities of perfluorohexane (C_{6}F_{14}) and water, since C_{6}F_{14} is the smallest suitable perfluoroalkane that is liquid at ambient conditions. C_{6}F_{14} was presented by a trimer of C-beads. We calculated the correlation between a_{CW} and the average infinite dilution activity coefficient (IDAC) for C_{6}F_{14}–H_{2}O binary systems (log_{10}(γ_{C6F14–H2O})+log_{10}(γ_{H2O–C6F14}))/2, along the lines of Refs [43] and  [47], but using the trimer as a reference component instead of monomers and dimers (see Sec. S-III of the supplementary material). The obtained large mismatch Δa_{CW} = a_{CW}–a_{II} = 36 kT/R_{c} is expected, since perfluoroalkanes are more hydrophobic than alkanes. We could not find reliable experimental or modeling data on perfluoroether—water and perfluoroether—perfluoroalkane binary solutions to estimate a_{EW} and a_{CE}. It is, however, known that lower perfluoroethers and perfluoroalkanes are miscible, but these mixtures phase separate as the molecular weights increase. Therefore, we assigned Δa_{CE} = 6kT/R_{c} that corresponds to the liquid-liquid separation starting from the mixture of tetramers (that is, the C_{8}F_{18}–C_{8}F_{12}O_{4} binary system). Unlike polyethylene glycols, perfluorinated polyethers are insoluble in water, although they are less hydrophobic than perfluoroalkanes. Following the trend from previous DPD simulations of Nafion [28,37], we estimated Δa_{EW} = (2/3)Δa_{CW} = 23 kT/R_{c} (considering that every third atom in the chain is hydrophilic). Due to strong hydrophobicity of the backbone, the obtained value corresponds to mutually insoluble liquids [53]. The sulfonate group S bead (Fig. 1) was treated as strongly hydrophilic with Δa_{SW} = −5kT/R_{c}, which yielded the best agreement between simulations and experiments for sulfonate surfactants in water [46]. Strong repulsion was set between the S bead and hydrophobic C and E beads (a_{SE} = a_{SC} = 119 kT/R_{c}).
D. Proton model and interaction parameters
The model for proton dissociation was introduced in Ref [40] and extends applications of coarse-grained simulations to reactive systems (e.g., Ref [54]). Proton is represented as a separate P bead charged at +e and is affected by drag and random forces as other beads according to Eq. (1) with the same dissipative parameter γ. The P bead is repelled from hydrophobic beads, C and E, that have no affinity to protons but can associate with water beads W, via an attractive short-range Morse potential [last term Fij(M)(r_{ij}) in Eq. (1)],
where K_{IJ} is the effective strength parameter and α_{IJ} is the effective steepness of the Morse potential. The potential (but not the force) was cut and shifted to zero at the cutoff radius r^{M}. While it is known that cut-and-shifted potentials (rather than cut-and shift forces) may increase errors in classical MD [55] (although, for example, cut-and-shifted Lennard-Jones potentials are routinely applied), the cut-and-shifted Morse potential with the DPD thermostat did not seem to cause serious problems; no energy drift was observed. The Morse potential parameters were fitted to the ratio of proton and water self-diffusion coefficients in pure water [40]. It is worth noting that here, in contrast to modeling of sulfonated polystyrene [41], we do not introduce Morse bonds between proton bead P and sulfonate bead S which interact only electrostatically. The Morse parameters derived in Ref [41] cannot be applied to Nafion, despite the same (sulfonic) acid group since its dissociation is much more facile compared to benzenesulfonic acid derivatives (for example, dissociation constant of triflic acid [56] is K_{a} = 10^{14}). Ab initio simulations of Nafion show that 3–4 water molecules around sulfonate group suffice to dissociate the O–H bond [10]. That is why we assumed that any water W bead overlapping with sulfonate S bead causes P–S dissociation. Due to the absence of repulsion between P and S beads, S beads are completely “passable” by P beads and belong to the proton-conducting domain of the membrane. The only hindrance S beads impose on P beads is due to the electrostatic attraction between the two. The model therefore mimics the actual mechanism of proton conductivity at low λ [57] (λ is the number of water molecules per sidechain) where sulfonates participate in the network of hydrogen bonds and are able to accept protons, move it by rotation around C–S bonds and other local motions, and pass to other waters or sulfonates. However, potential barriers associated with proton conduction by the sulfonate anions cannot be reproduced on the coarse-grained level.
Figure 2(a) illustrates the DPD model of proton transfer between two water beads W_{1} and W_{2} applied here. Initially, the proton bead P is associated with W_{1} by the P–W_{1} Morse bond. When another water bead W_{2} appears within the P–W Morse potential cutoff, an intermediate complex W_{1}–P–W_{2} is formed. The potential energy of the intermediate shown in Fig. 2(b) is the sum of the repulsion potential between water beads W_{1} and W_{2} and the two Morse potentials of P–W_{1} and P–W_{2} bonds. The potential energy profile has two minima along the reaction coordinate r_{PW1}/r_{W1W2} (P bead is assumed to be located on the line connecting the centers of W beads). The two minima are separated by a potential barrier associated with possible activated hopping of proton from W_{1} to W_{2}. The minima merge when the distance between the water beads becomes shorter, effectively creating a single potential well. When W_{1}–W_{2} distance increases again due to thermal fluctuations, the proton may either migrate from W_{1} to W_{2} or remain with W_{1} after two water beads are separated later.
E. Details of DPD simulations of hydrated Nafion
Using the force field described above, we performed several DPD simulations of hydrated Nafion. Each Nafion chain contained 20 monomers (280 beads total). Sidechains were placed at regular intervals (all monomers were exactly the same). P beads were added stoichiometrically (one per monomer) and W beads were added to model the given hydration level that varied from 2 to 17 wt. % of the dry polymer weight. The DPD simulation was performed in an NPT ensemble [58] as implemented in the DL_MESO DPD package [59], with the target pressure equal to the pressure of pure coarse-grained water (p^{DPD} = 70kT/R_{c}^{3} at a = 78kT/R_{c} and ρR_{c}^{3} = 3). The total system size was quite large, about 50 × 50 × 50R_{c}^{3} (32.5 × 32.5 × 32.5 nm^{3}) with approximately 2.9 × 10^{5} particles and the total number of steps equaled 2 × 10^{6}. The time step in DPD units was 0.01 (m_{W}R_{c}^{2}/kT)^{1/2}, where m_{W} is the mass of the water bead.
III. SELF-ASSEMBLED SEGREGATION MORPHOLOGY
Figure 3 presents the evolution of the segregated morphology of the acid form of Nafion at different hydration levels. Water transport occurs within the aqueous subphase formed by water beads. As usual in PEMs, at low hydration below the percolation threshold (estimated as λ ≈ 3.6; see below), water forms separate small clusters, which make an interconnected percolating network as the hydration level increases: the aqueous phase essentially forms a network of water channels or pores in the hydrophobic matrix. To characterize the segregated morphology, we employ a geometrical algorithm commonly applied to the characterization of the pore structure of solid adsorbents [37]. We generate a series of snapshots representing segregated morphologies at given conditions and create their digitized lattice replicas. The lattice is cubic with a grid of 0.5R_{c}. Each lattice site is assigned to either mobile aqueous or immobile polymer subphase based on the local composition of beads around that particular site. Since we deal with a soft-core model, different types of beads may overlap in the vicinity of the given lattice site. In order to assign a lattice site to either the mobile or immobile subphase, we introduce the site preference p(r→{l}) that determines whether mobile or immobile beads prevail in the vicinity of site l. If p is negative, site l is assigned to mobile subphase through which a water molecule or a proton can diffuse; otherwise site l is assigned to the immobile domain. The site preference is defined as follows:
Here, r¯{l} is the coordinate of the center of a lattice site l, r¯{i} is coordinate of the ith bead, and t_{i} is a mobility marker related to the bead type: t_{i} = −1 for all mobile W beads and t_{i} = 1 was assigned to immobile hydrophobic polymer beads (E, C). A special treatment was applied to S beads. They are attached to the backbone and thus are “immobile” as they are not involved in water transport. However, unlike sulfonate groups in sPS that are rigidly attached to benzene rings, Nafion sulfonates are much more flexible compared to the backbone. Dorenbos and Suga [30] comparing experimental and simulation results treated the sulfonate groups as a part of the mobile subphase (note that in theoretical diffusion models, the entire volume occupied by the sidechain contributes to the mobile domain [35]). In our earlier work [37], the S bead included the adjacent –CF_{2}– group and was treated as immobile. The difference of this work is in explicit modeling of protons, which the sulfonate groups can directly conduct. Therefore, in this work, we use different digitization of the simulated snapshots for modeling water and proton transport defined by Eq. (5). For treating water diffusion, the S bead is considered as immobile that corresponds to the parameter t_{S} = 0. For treating proton diffusion, the S bead is considered as mobile that corresponds to the parameter t_{S} = −1 in Eq. (5).
The network of hydrophilic clusters was treated as a network of pores (channels) that conduct water and protons. Figure 4 shows the pore size distribution for the hydrophilic pore networks with t_{S} = 0 obtained from the Poreblazer software [60,61] via algorithms based on the Connolly surfaces [62]. Namely, point X in the mobile subphase is assumed to belong to a pore of size larger than the given size d, if there exists a sphere of diameter d that includes X but does not include any of the lattice sites belonging to the immobile subphase. The total number of such pores provides the integral pore size distribution (PSD) function, V_{m}(d), that is the volume of the space that belongs to the pores of diameters larger than d; the respective differential PSD is obtained as the derivative, –dV_{m}/dd. The Connolly analysis is performed on the same lattice replicas and the random walk simulation to evaluate the pore connectivity. Points within the hydrophilic subphase are chosen in random, and for each point, the pore size is measured, and the probability distribution is built. It should be noted that the Connolly surface analysis provides no information on the pore connectivity, which is studied using the random walk method described below.
It is no surprise that the pore size increases with the hydration level λ. While at λ = 1.5 (2.1 wt. % to dry polymer weight or 0.5 water beads per P bead, which means that only about half of P-beads are dissociated) the pore size is compared to the bead diameter (thus, each presumably isolated cluster contains one or several water beads), at λ = 6 (8.5 wt. %, 2 W beads per sidechain) the mode of the PSD corresponds to 2.2 nm and at λ = 9 (3 W beads per sidechain, 13.8 wt. %) this size is about 3 nm, with some pores reaching 4 nm in diameter. Noteworthy, this particular size of the hydrophilic channels in Nafion was suggested in the pioneering work of Gierke [63] back in 1982. It is worth noting that for the acid form, 13.8 wt. % hydration is still well below the maximum possible at saturation condition, where hydration level may reach 19 wt. %. Interestingly, in all systems, the pore size distributions seem to be bimodal. They contain a peak at very small (subnanometer) sizes and a peak corresponding to larger aggregates. The second peak grows and corresponds to increasing pore sizes as λ grows, while the former diminishes but always correspond to 0.6-0.9 nm pore diameter, that is, comparable with the bead size. That peak probably corresponds to individual hydrated sulfonic acid groups. Such clusters consist of a proton that electrostatically attracts a sulfonate group and forms Morse bonds with one or two water beads. They are disconnected at very low hydration levels, which is indicated by zero tracer diffusivity (described in Sec. VI). At higher λ, however, random walk analysis shows practically no isolated water beads; therefore, we have to assume that the individual hydrated sulfonates coalesce into very narrow channels (slightly thicker than one bead size) composed of sulfonates, protons, and water, linking the larger clusters. The larger clusters as appear in Fig. 3 still have mostly cylindrical shape.
The Connolly surface method also allowed evaluation of the total area of the interface between the two subphases. The solvated Nafion membrane is treated as a porous material with hydrophilic channels embedded in a hydrophobic matrix. The specific surface area is an important characteristic of pore structure morphology. The decrease of the surface area upon increase of the water content indicates growth and coalescence of water clusters. At λ = 6–9, the total surface was about 210 m^{2}/g and at λ = 3 it increased to 242 m^{2}/g. The magnitude is typical for nanoporous adsorbents; for example, it exceeds the specific surface area of controlled pore glasses but is less than that of active carbons or modern regular nanoporous adsorbents.
IV. WATER DIFFUSION
A. Static method
Using the digitized lattice replicas of segregated Nafion membrane, we analyze the pore network connectivity and water diffusion simulating random walks (RWs) of a tracer particle within the mobile subphase [30,37]. The RW simulation starts from a randomly selected lattice site that belonged to the mobile subphase, and each step is an attempted move to one of the six sites that neighbor the current location. The move is accepted if the attempted site belongs to the mobile subphase and rejected otherwise. 10^{4} random walks of 10^{5} steps each are performed on each of 400 replicas for proper averaging. Note that the lattice replica is static: it corresponds to a particular snapshot. It implies that any change in the segregation structure (no matter how minor) is infinitely slow compared to the water molecule diffusion. If two clusters are not connected, they will never be connected, and if a connection exists, it will never be broken. Therefore the RW model ignores the dynamic percolation effect of merging bridges between water clusters that was shown to be an important factor in water mobility at low hydration levels [64].
The correlations between the step number and the mean square displacement of the trace particle obtained by averaging over all random walks have a classical shape with an asymptotic linear dependence between the step number and MSD for long walks (examples are shown in Sec. S-IV of the supplementary material). The self-diffusion coefficient D_{W} estimated from the slope of the linear asymptote is presented in Fig. 5 in a reduced form as the ratio of the water self-diffusion coefficient in the membrane and that in the bulk water D_{W}/D_{B}. The bulk diffusion coefficient D_{B} was determined by the same method applied to the lattice with all sites belonging to the mobile phase. At low hydration, λ < 3.6, the diffusion coefficient is negligibly small, which means the aqueous subphase is composed of isolated water clusters and does not percolate. The hydration level of λ = 3.6, at which the diffusion coefficient is very small yet palpable, is determined as the percolation threshold. It is worth noting that the resulting MSDs for each λ are averaged over all frames, and MSDs for two different frames may differ qualitatively (one percolate and the other not), especially at λ close to the percolation threshold, due to statistical fluctuations of the morphology in a limited periodic system. Only frames with percolated mobile domain (and in those frames, only the walks that start from the percolated networks inside the aqueous subphase) positively contribute to MSD at large step numbers. Thus, a non-zero D_{W} is by itself evidence of a percolation at least in some frames of the trajectory. At λ = 3.6, most frames have a non-percolated mobile subphase, and even in the percolated frames most RWs start in “dead end pockets.” However, select frames do contain percolating systems of water channels, and as a result water diffusion becomes detectable. D_{W} increases with λ. At higher hydration levels, λ > 6, the correlation between D_{W} and λ is nearly exponential, D_{W}/D_{B}=exp(β(λ−λ_{0})), where β = 0.077, and λ_{0} = 18.7 is the extrapolated hydration level, at which D_{W} would achieve the bulk value; λ_{0} is above the maximum hydration level of the Nafion polymer achieved at equilibrium with the saturated water vapor.
B. Dynamic method
Water self-diffusion coefficients can also be estimated directly from the mean square displacement (MSD) of the water beads during the DPD simulation run. Because time step in DPD is not unequivocally defined, we present only D/D_{B} (that is, all diffusion coefficients are reduced to that of bulk water which was taken as the self-diffusion coefficient of water beads multiplied by 3) [69].D_{B} for this purpose was obtained from mean square displacements of W beads in a separate simulation of water bulk conducted with the same model and the same time step as the simulations of hydrated polymer. In this case, the segregation structure evolves in the process of simulation. We called this method dynamic in contrast to the static RW method described above. It accounts for the effect of dynamic percolation. As seen in Fig. 5, the diffusion coefficients obtained in the dynamic DPD and static RW methods agree very reasonably at high λ. RW predicts a somewhat faster water diffusion, probably because the static method does not distinguish properly between the motion of water beads located in close vicinity to the channel walls and those located in the central part of the channels. However, at λ < 4.5, the dynamic method yields much higher D_{W} values than the static method. The reason for the difference is the effect of dynamic percolation due to the evolution of the segregated structure in the course of DPD simulation: the hydrophilic clusters may merge and split due to thermal fluctuations and, thus, water beads may easier pass from one cluster to another which increases their overall mobility. These dynamic percolation effects were for the first time observed in our earlier MD simulations of hydrated Nafion [64], although insufficient system size and simulation time prevented from a quantitative evaluation.
C. Comparison with experiments
The self-diffusion coefficients of water calculated with the static and dynamic methods can be compared with experimental results, although this task is not very straightforward, because the experimental results depend on the measurement method and sample (membrane preparation and processing): the reference experimental system cannot be precisely defined. Even the commercially available polymer itself has changed somewhat over the years; plus, it is known that thermal treatment reduces water sorption and transport properties [70] even without chemical degradation of the polymer, which can hardly be described by a soft-core model. Another possible reason for deviation of NMR data between different experiments and simulations is a multi-scale heterogeneity in hydrated Nafion [34] which includes areas of higher and lower hydration, with the latter being semi-crystalline. Percolation is observed earlier in more hydrated areas, and that facilitates the overall diffusion. As a result, the measured water diffusivity becomes dependent on the NMR experimental protocol. Unfortunately, soft-core DPD model cannot reproduce perfluoroalkane semi-crystallites, and the simulation box size is still insufficient for treating multi-scale morphologies.
A comprehensive review of experimental studies of water diffusion can be found in Ref [68]. Most of the experimental studies explore the dependence of water mobility on relative humidity, and relatively few report the dependence on the water content, D_{W}(λ), that is calculated. Among published experimental data, we selected NMR studies on E-type samples that did not undergo a dry thermal treatment. Just as our simulations, NMR does not distinguish between neutral water molecules and charged hydronium ions, unlike some of the theoretical models applied to extract D_{W} from water absorption and steady state flow measurements (see Ref [68]). It should also be mentioned that the EW of our polymer is slightly higher than 1100 Da that is most common today and is closer to an EW of 1200 Da with which most of the earlier experimental studies were performed [71].
In Fig. 5, we present the self-diffusion coefficients D_{W} obtained in several prominent NMR studies taken from the literature. Comparison with experiment is given in two forms: presenting actual computed and experimental data points without employing any adjustable parameters [Fig. 5(a)] and presenting reduced (normalized) computed and experimental data points [Fig. 5(b)]. We should note that the NMR results of different authors do not precisely agree with each other with bigger deviations at low hydration levels. Our results calculated by the dynamic method from the MSD of W beads agree very well with the data reported by Ochi et_al [66,68] throughout the concentration range. Data obtained by other authors are somewhat higher especially at low hydration levels and show a softer percolation transition.
Data normalized by the respective data value obtained at the reference hydration level of λ=10 in the same experiment or simulation, D_{W}(λ)/D_{W}λ=10, are given in Fig. 5(b). The normalized plots are in agreement above the percolation threshold, where the predictions of both the static and dynamic methods coincide with experiments. Figure 5(b) clearly demonstrates the importance of the dynamic percolation effects at low hydration, where the static and dynamic methods significantly deviate. It also shows the limitations of the DPD model that, as any coarse-grained model, cannot provide reliable quantitative data on the scale smaller that the bead size. Below the percolation threshold, the DPD model underestimates the experimental water mobility that is not surprising because it relies on an oversimplified representation of the water structure: the smallest water cluster possible, a single water bead, still contains three water molecules. The dynamic DPD model underestimates the effects of dynamics percolation at low hydration, which are related to merging inter-cluster bridges formed by just few water molecules. These subtle features increase the effective connectivity of the water subphase, facilitate water diffusion at low hydration, and shift the percolation threshold to a higher hydration level that is observed experimentally.
Overall, given the level of discrepancies between different experiments, we should conclude that the proposed coarse-grained model adequately reproduces the hydration dependence of water diffusion, and the obtained results are within the experimental range even close to the percolation threshold. The dynamic method gives better agreement with experiment, compared to the static method that demonstrates the importance of the dynamic percolation effects in hydrated Nafion.
D. Water diffusion in metal-substituted Nafion
An interesting practical question is the influence of the cation on water transport in metal-substituted membranes that are used as diffusion protective barriers against chemical toxic agents [1]. In our previous simulations of ionic systems [46], we noticed that the currently used DPD models of ions are essentially limited to spherically symmetric charge clouds and do not distinguish the specifics of different metals. The proton model that we use here is however different due to the ability to form bonds with water beads. To examine the cation influence on the water transport, we perform selected simulations of Nafion salt with alkali metal counter-ions. These simulations are similar to those described above, but instead of P beads we have the hydrated alkali metal cation beads M^{+} (depicted in Fig. 1). Each of them includes a metal cation and 2.5 water molecules; it had a positive charge and all short-range parameters equaled to those of W bead. The self-diffusion coefficients determined by the dynamic method are shown in Fig. 5(a); they are smaller than for acid systems at lower λ and slightly higher at larger λ (the latter difference is likely due to the non-zero counterion volume that contributes to the mobile subphase). The percolation threshold is shifted to a higher hydration level λ. This finding qualitatively agrees with the experimental results that show faster water diffusion in acid samples compared to similar samples with metal cations [5]. Note that we compare acid and alkali metal forms of Nafion at the same hydration level rather than at the same humidity that would be more natural. However, comparison at the same humidity requires simulation of the water sorption isotherm that has not been done yet in the DPD model of the acid form of Nafion and is not expected to accurately reproduce experimental results.
In Fig. 6, we compare the simulation results with experimental data on water self-diffusion on Nafion salts with alkali metals in saturation conditions (100% humidity) reported by Yeager [72]. This comparison is possible due to availability of the data on the hydration levels for different Nafion salts [5,72,73]. The properties of Nafion salts depend significantly on the metal ion, even if the ion is relatively simple and is not involved in complex interactions like coordination. Water sorption in alkali metal substituted Nafion decreases with the increase of metal ion size and water saturation for different alkali metals is achieved at different λ [5,72,73]. Since our model does not distinguish between the ions of the same charge at the same λ, in order to compare simulation results with experimental, we used the dependence of λ on the ion size from the data reported in Refs [5],  [72], and  [73]. The counterion influences water sorption and thus affects the diffusion coefficient. The model predicts D_{W} with a very reasonable accuracy (especially water diffusion in Cs^{+} form of Nafion is in an excellent agreement with our simulations at the same λ). Yet the shortcomings are clearly visible on this graph: K^{+} and Na^{+} form larger solvation shells in water than Cs^{+}. Same happens in hydrated Nafion: due to stronger interactions between the ion and water (and sulfonate groups as well), water in Na^{+} form of Nafion is higher at the same humidity than in Cs^{+} substituted Nafion, which our model cannot predict. But overall, the observed correlation with experimental data on Nafion salts shown in Fig. 6 confirm the robustness of the proposed coarse-grained model.
V. PROTON MOBILITY
To characterize the proton mobility, we employ the same techniques applied to water. The static method (tracer random walk in digitized snapshot replicas) allows one to qualitatively estimate the location of the percolation threshold for the proton-conducting hydrophilic sub-phase. Note that as discussed above in Sec. III, we use different digitization of the simulated snapshots for modeling water and proton transport using the static method. The proton conductive subphase includes S beads representing sulfonate groups in addition to the water beads that constitute the subphase for water diffusion. In experiment, proton can be passed from one sulfonate group to another without a complete dissociation and corresponding association with water. In the static method, this mechanism is mimicked by a possibility of proton passing through a sulfonate S bead from which the P bead does not repel at short distances even if the system does not have enough water to dissociate the sulfonate groups. Thus, with respect to the proton mobility, the S bead is treated as a part of the mobile subphase. To account qualitatively for proton conduction by sulfonate at low hydration, we constructed static replicas including sulfonate groups in the proton-conducting hydrophilic subphase, setting t_{S} = −1 in Eq. (5), as it was done in the work of Dorenbos and Suga [30]. It is worth noting that the model in Ref [30] is qualitatively different not only in terms of the parameterization but mainly by not taking into account the electrostatic interactions and the specifics of the proton and water mobility; see for more details Sec. S-VI of the supplementary material.
The random walk analysis performed in this model gives an estimate of the percolation threshold for proton diffusion, which corresponded to a slightly lower value of ∼3.3, compared to ∼3.6 for water diffusion determined in the static model without sulfonate groups in the hydrophilic subphase. At λ = 3.6, almost all replicas had a percolating structure of proton-conducting channels that included sulfonate groups. Comparison of the diffusion coefficients of protons, D_{P}, and water, D_{w}, determined by the static method shows higher mobility of protons compared to water due to extended proton-conducting subphase; see Fig. S7 and Sec. S-V of the supplementary material. However, the ratio D_{P}/D_{w} is much smaller than what is expected from the experiments due to the neglect of the specifics of hopping and vehicular mechanisms of proton transport. Figure S8 of the supplementary material shows the striking difference with the predictions of the proton diffusivity determined by the dynamic method that is discussed below.
The dynamic method, which is based on the analysis of MSD of proton beads in the course of DPD simulations, provides the direct measurement of the proton self-diffusion accounting for hopping and vehicular mechanism as prescribed by the proposed model of proton transport. The simulation results are presented in Fig. 7 with experimental results obtained from the literature data on NMR and conductivity measurements. As for the water self-diffusion, comparison with experiment is given in two forms: presenting actual computed and experimental data points given in the literature without employing any adjustable parameters [Fig. 7(a)] and presenting reduced (normalized) computed and experimental data points [Fig. 7(b)].
Proton mobility in Nafion has been extensively studied in the literature. Proton conductivity is the most common property that characterizes the mobility of the protons, although some studies directly explore proton diffusion by NMR. From DPD, we can only extract the proton self-diffusion coefficient D_{P} (or, more precisely, it is a ratio to that of water bulk D_{P}/D_{B}). From experimental conductivities, D_{P} may be obtained using the Nernst-Einstein equation (see Sec. S-VII of the supplementary material). A comparison between diffusion coefficients obtained by NMR and proton conductivity experiments is given in review [68] (with D_{P} values either reported by the authors of the original experimental studies or in some cases recalculated from conductivities by the authors of the review [68]). In general, D_{P} calculated from the measured conductivity are somewhat larger than D_{P} directly determined in NMR experiments, although the difference obtained for the same sample is minor. Similar to the water diffusion data, D_{P}λ correlations obtained on different samples deviate substantially. The deviation originates from both the differences in measured conductivities and differences in water adsorption isotherms on Nafion samples measured by different research groups.
Figure 7 shows the hydration level dependence of the proton self-diffusion coefficient, D_{P}λ, calculated by the dynamic method from the MSD of P beads and seven different sets of experimental data obtained directly in NMR experiments and calculated from the measured conductivity by the Nernst-Einstein equation by the data authors. The experimental data values are shown as given in the literature without any recalculation. Similar to Fig. 5, we present both the proton diffusion coefficients related to the bulk diffusion coefficient of water, D_{p}/D_{B} [Fig. 7(a)], and the data normalized by the respective data value obtained at the reference hydration level of λ=10 in the same experiment or simulation, D_{P}(λ)/D_{P}(λ=10) [Fig. 7(b)]. Even at high λ, experimental data on D_{P} show discrepancies up to the factor of 3. Our results fall very well within the experimental range at every λ. Yet, overall the proton data have the same tendency as the water diffusion coefficient: underestimation of proton mobility at low hydration levels. The mechanisms of proton mobility at low hydration were studied by ab initio simulations [10,57], which showed that protons are passed between sulfonate groups through single molecule thin bridges of water molecules connected by hydrogen bonds. A soft-core model with a bead composed of three molecules is incapable of reproducing the proton motion at such conditions. Therefore, discrepancies between experiment and simulations are expected at very low λ. However, taking into account the spread of measurement data, the proposed model provides semi-quantitative agreement with experimental observations despite its inherent coarse-grained crudeness.
Another interesting property is the ratio of proton to water diffusivities, D_{P}(λ)/D_{W}(λ), that quantifies the enhancement of proton diffusion due to the hopping mechanism. The proton-water Morse potential was parameterized to reproduce the ratio, D_{P}/D_{B}, of the proton diffusion coefficient to that of bulk water [40]. In the water bulk, D_{P}/D_{W} ≈ 3.8 [77]. The proton is about four times as mobile as a water molecule thanks to the Grotthuss hopping mechanism. In hydrated PEM, the hopping mechanisms are also in effect, including proton transfer to and from sulfonate ions; however, the ratio D_{P}/D_{W} is smaller than in bulk water; see Fig. 8. This ratio is affected by two competing factors: (a) association of protons with sulfonate groups that hinders proton mobility. This factor is present in the entire range of λ. At low hydration, there is not enough water to solvate all protons which tend to associate with sulfonates. This effect was found prominent in hydrated sPS at low λ, where proton diffusion was even slower than that of water [41]. Dissociation of Nafion is more facile. But even at complete dissociation, electrostatic attraction between solvated protons and immobile sulfonates hinders proton diffusion and leads to a lower D_{P}/D_{W} ratio than in the bulk; (b) because protons can pass through sulfonates, the connectivity of proton-conducting subphase is better than in water-conducting subphase; this effect is only visible at low hydration close to the percolation threshold, when water diffusion diminishes, and it becomes negligible at high hydration.
Figure 8 displays the proton diffusion enhancement ratio, D_{P}/D_{W}, in the range of hydration levels, λ, where DPD simulations allow us to reasonable estimate D_{P} and D_{W}. The role of a better connectivity of proton-conducting subphase prevails over the sulfonate-proton attraction leading to higher D_{P}/D_{W}. As λ increases, this factor becomes less important and D_{P}/D_{W} gradually decreases. Eventually, the protons become well hydrated, pores become larger, and D_{P}/D_{W} starts growing towards the bulk value.
The simulated proton self-diffusion coefficient can be used for estimating the proton conductivity as a function of the hydration level, σ_{P}λ, using the Nernst-Einstein equation. The simulation results on proton conductivity are presented in Fig. S8 and Sec. S-VII of the supplementary material in comparison with the experimental data taken from different literature sources [65,66,70,74]. We present the experimental data reported on the σ_{P}λ dependence as given in the literature sources without any data treatment in Fig. S8(a) of the supplementary material. Accounting for a significant spread of experimental data, the DPD simulation provides a reasonable correlation with the measurements. Plotting in Fig. S8(b) of the supplementary material the data normalized by the respective data value obtained at the reference hydration level of λ=10 in the same experiment or simulation, σ_{P}λ/σ_{P}λ=10, we found a semi-quantitative agreement for the overall trend of the σ_{P}λ dependence in the wide range of hydration levels above the percolation threshold.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
Due to its unique transport properties, Nafion polymer is widely used in modern technologies. Nafion membranes in acid form are commonly employed as perm-selective conductive membranes in various electrochemical technologies, including full cells, and metal substituted membranes are explored as diffusion protection barriers against toxic compounds, such as chemical warfare agents and toxic industrial chemicals. Formed by a hydrophobic perfluorinated backbone and sidechains terminated by hydrophilic sulfonate groups, Nafion polymers exhibit nanoscale phase separation upon hydration onto interwoven hydrophilic and hydrophobic subphases. While the hydrophilic subphase provide pathways for water permeability and proton conductivity, high area of the interface between hydrophilic and hydrophobic subphases facilitate capture of undesirable compounds. The engineering properties of Nafion membranes, including water permeability, perm-selectivity, and proton conductivity, depend on the specifics of nanophase separation morphology. The main objective of this work is to develop a computational model of Nafion capable of predicting the geometrical properties of hydrated Nafion membranes and their transport properties.
We present a coarse-grained model of the acid form of Nafion membrane that explicitly includes the proton transport by mimicking both vehicular and hopping mechanisms and electrostatic interactions using the smeared charge approximation. The proposed model is based on a soft-core bead representation of the polymer and implemented into the DPD simulation framework. Nafion molecule is dissected into three types of beads of an effective diameter of 0.65 nm, which represent two hydrophobic fragments of the perfluorinated backbone and the sidechain, and hydrophilic sulfonate groups. The accepted level of coarse-graining corresponds to presenting water as a bead composed of three molecules. Proton is modeled as a separate bead which may form dissociable Morse bonds with water beads and interacts with sulfonate groups electrostatically. The parameterization of the model is performed according to the scale-bridging parameterization methodology [40,47] by fitting the DPD repulsion parameters to the solubilities of respective reference compounds and the bond parameters to the chain conformations from respective atomistic MD simulations. The proton-water Morse potential is parameterized to provide the correct enhancement of the proton diffusion in bulk water due to the hopping mechanism.
With the proposed model, we study the specifics of phase separation of hydrated Nafion onto interwoven hydrophilic and hydrophobic subphases. The qualitative features of the evolution of the Nafion morphology upon hydration are well known from the early papers dating back to the seminal work of Gierke and Hsu [63]. At low hydration, the hydrophilic subphase represents a system of isolated clusters of water molecules surrounding the sulfonate groups. As the hydration level increases, the water clusters grow and coalesce, and as a percolation threshold is achieved, a 3D network of water permeable hydrophilic channels is formed [78]. Efficiency of the membrane water permeability and proton mobility is determined by the morphology and connectivity of the hydrophobic subphase. We quantify the geometrical properties of the hydrophilic subphase based on digitized lattice replicas of the phase separated membrane. Treating water channels as permeable pores embedded in the hydrophobic matrix, we calculate the pore size distribution and the surface area of the hydrophilic-hydrophobic interface using the Connolly method employed for solid porous bodies [61]. We find that the size of water channels increases with hydration from ∼1 to ∼4 nm. The network connectivity is characterized with the random walk (RW) method [30] by simulating tracer diffusion. The percolation threshold is found as the hydration level λ, i.e., the average number of water molecules per sulfonate group, achieves ∼3.6. With this method, we determine the reduced water diffusivity as a function of hydration, which shows a dramatic decrease at the percolation threshold. The RW method is static and it does not take into account the effect of dynamic percolation due to merging water bridges between the water clusters, which was found earlier with atomistic MD simulations [64].
Water diffusion at dynamic conditions is studied by direct simulation of self-diffusion of water beads in the course of the DPD simulation run. The water self-diffusion coefficient determined by this dynamic method reasonably agrees at high and moderate hydration above the percolation threshold (λ > 4.5) yet significantly exceeds at low hydration the diffusivity calculated by the static method. This observation confirms the importance of the dynamic percolation effect.
The results of simulations are compared with four sets of experimental NMR data on water self-diffusion in Nafion taken from different literature sources. To avoid ambiguity, we present simulated and experimental data in two forms, using actual (without involvement of any adjustable parameters or re-calculation of published data) and normalized values. It worth noting that the experimental data taken from different sources exhibit a substantial spread due to the difference in mainly in the samples employed that were differently prepared and processed. Comparison with actual experimental data shows excellent quantitative agreement with one set of experimental data [66,68] and qualitative agreement with the others at relatively high hydration (λ > 4.5). At the same time, the experimental data normalized at the reference hydration level of λ = 10 agree well with the dynamic method prediction above the percolation threshold and show qualitatively similar trend below percolation threshold. However, the DPD simulation significantly underestimates the experimental data below the percolation threshold. This discrepancy is attributed to the deficiency of the coarse-grained DPD model with three water molecules per bead to describe the fine structure of the water cluster network, permeability of which at low hydration is determined by single molecule bridges between small water clusters.
To demonstrate the effect of counter-ions on transport properties of metal-substituted Nafion membranes, we performed simulation of water diffusion by the dynamic method using the proposed DPD model, in which proton beads are replaced by solvated alkali metal cations. The results of simulation are found in agreement with the experimental literature data on Nafion salts; association with counterions hinders water mobility compared to that in the acid form polymer.
The proton self-diffusion coefficient was directly calculated by the dynamic method by calculating the mean square displacement of proton beads as a function of simulation time in the course of DPD simulation. With the proton-water Morse interaction potentials, we effectively mimic the Grotthuss hopping mechanism of proton transport that enhances proton diffusion compared to water. The simulation results are compared with seven sets of experimental data taken from different NMR and conductivity studies. The proposed DPD model captures the general trend of the dependence of the proton mobility on the hydration level, showing a sharp decrease around the percolation threshold leveled due to the dynamics percolation effects. The computed self-diffusion coefficient is found within the spread of the experimental data providing a semi-quantitative agreement with the measurements. The proton conductivity calculated from the simulated diffusivity by the Nernst-Einstein equation also provides a reasonable correlation with the experimental conductivity data above the percolation threshold. At the same time, it should be noted that the DPD model cannot reproduce the fine structure of the water cluster network on the sub-nanometer scale comparable with the size of coarse-grained beads used in simulation. Therefore, at low hydration, the modeling results should be considered as qualitative estimates.
Overall, the proposed model opens up an opportunity to study self-assembly and water and proton transport in polyelectrolytes using computationally efficient DPD simulations. Comparison of the simulation results with diverse experimental data on water and proton diffusion in Nafion membranes shows that the relationships obtained are mainly in agreement with the NMR and conductivity measurements. We shed light on the specific features of the water and proton transport that were overlooked in the earlier literature such as the dynamic percolation effects, the role of electrostatic interactions, and the importance of accounting for the hopping mechanism of proton diffusion in coarse-grained modeling. However, further refinement of the model is required to make it a practical tool for theory informed design and optimization of perm-selective and ion-conducting membranes with improved properties.
