Analysis of flows by deposition of diamond-like structures
The Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method is used to simulate the hydrogen–methane mixtures flowing through a heated cylindrical tungsten tube and expanding into a low-pressure chamber in the substrate holder direction. The DSMC method takes into account heterogeneous reactions in the tube and on the substrate surface. The results of DSMC simulation are used for the chemical kinetics calculations, i.e., axial distributions of species concentrations in various H/C mixtures. The effects of various parameters (reactor configuration, flow rate, initial concentration of methane in the mixture with hydrogen, and pressure in the chamber) on species fluxes to the substrate, the degree of hydrogen dissociation, the degree of methane decomposition, and further conversion of C_{x}H_{y} components up to atomic carbon C are numerically studied. The developed method provides a possibility of solving similar problems for nonequilibrium flows.
I. INTRODUCTION
Gas-phase deposition of diamond-like structures from mixtures of hydrogen with hydrocarbons is performed by various methods of activation (dissociation) of the initial gases: in a high-frequency discharge, in a thermal plasma flow, in a flame, due to thermal activation on hot filaments, and due to laser excitation. These methods were described in various publications [1,2]. The present study is aimed to investigate gas-dynamic and physical–chemical processes by formation of high velocity flows of containing hydrocarbons gas mixtures, just mixtures of hydrogen and methane, which are activated in cylindrical channels. It is the main content of the presented study. It is worth noting that some questions of the considered problems are related to rarefied gas flows in channels. A vast majority of researchers have considered flows regardless of possible influence of heterogeneous processes on the surface [3–5].
The composition of gases transporting to the substrate surface and energetic state of active fragments is of paramount importance for kinetics of diamond synthesis [6–9]. The specific feature of our approach is taking into account the heterogeneous process of dissociation due to multiple collisions of molecules with a hot surface [10–12], as it was realized for hydrogen–methane jets [12–16]. Using the described method, diamond-like structures were deposited in a wide range of conditions: at various pressures (1-20 Torr), source methane concentration (0.1%-1%), and different hydrogen flow rates (100-1500 SCCM) [13,14,16]. From the gas dynamic point of view, these conditions can be characterized for cylindrical channels by Knudsen numbers Kn = 10^{−4}–1 and Reynolds numbers 1-100 that correspond to the region from free-molecular to continuum flow, far from turbulent regimes (critical value for turbulence appearance in tube stationary flows Re_{cr} ∼ 2300). The effective method for computational analysis is the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method [17] in real three-dimensional or two-dimensional axisymmetric (3-D or 2-D(r, z)) formulations of reactor geometry.
The motion of individual particles and their collisions are simulated, which allows natural implementation of various models of gas/surface interaction. However, this method is computationally expensive, especially for correct modeling of gas flows with small amounts of carbon-containing components C_{x}H_{y} formed as a result of methane decomposition. They can play the important role in the formation of crystalline structures and should be considered in formulation of the problem. The decomposition of the initial gases (CH_{4} and H_{2}) and further conversion of the H/C components of the mixture in gas-phase reactions can be studied by a one-dimensional approach based on solving chemical kinetics equations.
The main goal of the present work is a numerical analysis of the influence of designated flow conditions on the ratio of the concentrations and energetic state of particles, colliding with a substrate. Wide ranges of conditions are studied: the aspect ratio of the channel L/d, where d is the channel diameter and L is the channel length, the hot tube temperature, composition and flow rate of a gas mixture, and background gas pressure.
II. FORMULATION OF THE PROBLEM
The set of parameters for numerical simulations are chosen as close as possible to the experimental conditions [12–16]. A gas mixture (1%-10%) CH_{4}/H_{2} with an initial temperature of 1500 K is injected into a cylindrical channel with diameter d = 0.003 m and length h + L (Fig. 1). The channel consists of two parts: input section (cylindrical domain 1) and output section (cylindrical domain 2). The length of the input section h is 0.01 m in all computations, whereas the length of the output section L is varied. The wall temperature is 1500 K in the input section and 2400 K in the output one. The mixture expands from the channel into vacuum chamber (cylindrical domain 3). At the distance L_{sub} = 0.01 m from the channel exit, there is a substrate onto which diamond is deposited. The diameter of the substrate is 0.015 m. The substrate temperature is taken to be 1300 K. The flow rate of hydrogen is varied from 750 to 3000 SCCM. Three values of the channel length L (0.0075, 0.015, and 0.03 m), three values of the methane concentration (1%, 3%, and 10%), and three values of the pressure in the chamber P (0, 2, and 20 Torr) are used in the computations. Boundary conditions on the cylindrical surface of the domain 3 are imposed, depending on the chosen pressure.
III. NUMERICAL METHODS
In the present work, flow simulation with allowance heterogeneous reactions is performed by the DSMC method. The results of DSMC simulation are used for calculation axial distributions of the concentrations of the components of the H/C mixture by methods of chemical kinetics.
A. Direct simulation Monte Carlo method
In the DSMC method, the simulated volume of the physical space is divided into cells, and a certain number of particles are modeled in each cell. The continuous process of particle motion and collisions is split into two consecutive stages: motion of particles within a time interval Δt in accordance with their velocities, followed by simulation of particle collisions in the interval Δt. The time step Δt is chosen to be small as compared to the mean time between the particle collisions. Summation of chosen values is performed at each time step to calculate various gas flow thermodynamic parameters.
The algorithm of the DSMC method is adapted to calculate flows in cylindrical channels and behind them (see Fig. 1). The majorant frequency scheme [18] is used in the computations. Verification of our program is performed through comparisons with tube flow simulations without chemical reactions under conditions of Ref [19]. Particle collisions are considered with the use of the variable soft sphere (VSS) model [17]. Particle/surface interaction is described by the specular-diffusion reflection model typical for rarefied gas dynamics [17]. Using this model requires some parameters, which allows one to describe the process of gas/surface interaction. First of all, this is the accommodation coefficient α: the particle is reflected from the surface in a diffuse manner with complete accommodation of momentum and energy with a probability α, and specular particle reflection occurs with a probability (1 − α). Dissociation (recombination) is described with a coefficient α_{d} (α_{r}), which means that a molecule dissociates with a probability α_{d} (in this case, atoms leave the surface with complete accommodation of momentum and energy), and a molecule is simply reflected from the surface with a probability (1 − α_{d}). The situation is similar for the coefficient α_{r}: atoms recombine with a probability α_{r} (in this case, the resultant molecule leaves the surface with complete accommodation of momentum and energy), and atoms are reflected from the surface with a probability (1 − α_{r}).
The accommodation coefficients have different values in the cold and hot parts of the channel. The dissociation and recombination coefficients are chosen on the basis of the numerical technique proposed in Ref [11] with the use of the experimental data [20,21]. A more detailed description of the parameters of the DSMC method can be found in Ref [22]. It should be noted that the simulations of hydrogen particle interactions with the cold surface of the channel involve only recombination of H atoms, whereas particle interactions with the hot surface involve both molecule dissociation and atom recombination. Recombination of hydrogen and partial absorption of methane on the substrate surface are simulated according to data of Refs [9] and  [22]. A detailed description of the parameters of the DSMC method is given in Appendix A.
Note that within the framework of the DSMC method, approaches to the simulation of gas-phase reactions are actively developing [23–26]. However, a detailed study of these approaches is aimed, mainly, at solving the problems of high-altitude aerodynamics. Additional limitations are associated with the need to model chemical reactions for small admixture.
B. One-dimensional (1-D(x)) model of chemical kinetics for axial distributions of components of H/C mixtures
The present analysis shows that dissociation and recombination of hydrogen due to gas-phase reactions under the considered conditions make minor contributions as compared to heterogeneous reactions. For this reason, gas-phase reactions of hydrogen can be neglected in calculating the gas-dynamic parameters of the flow. Obtaining more detailed information about the concentrations of particles approaching the substrate requires data on the degree of methane decomposition into fragments. The flow analysis shows that the gas parameters are distributed fairly uniformly over the radius (see Sec. IV A). From the gas dynamic point of view, evaluation shows that gas phase reactions for H_{2} have small effect on mixture composition comparing to heterogeneous ones because of the short duration of staying in a channel (and the methane amount is small). It persuades us to neglect gas-phase reactions when modeling the flow by the DSMC method. In this case, it is possible to use the one-dimensional approach for calculation changes in the mixture composition along the flow axis by means of solving a system of chemical kinetics equations. The following procedure is used for this purpose:
1. The flow with a given flow rate, initial methane concentration, the background pressure in the chamber P, and reactor configuration is modeled by the DSMC method. The computational domain is split into ring-shaped cells, which are used for simulations and information acquisition. Spatial (over the cells) distributions of the flow parameters are calculated. After that the data are used for calculating the averaged (over the radius) parameters of the flow from the tube entrance to the substrate. The averaging diameter is equal to the tube diameter. Thus, the averaged distributions of flow parameters in one-dimensional cells along the flow axis are found (concentrations of H_{2}, H, and CH_{4}, velocity V_{x}, and temperature T).
2. Based on the flow velocity and cell size, the mean time of methane particle residence t_{1} in the first cell is calculated (the cells are counted from the plane where the gas mixture source is located). After that averaged parameters of a gas calculated by the DSMC method are taken, and the system of chemical kinetics equations is solved to find the change of the mixture composition during the time t_{1}.
3. The resultant percent composition of the mixture obtained at the previous stage is used to calculate the mixture composition in the next cell on the basis of the available DSMC data. After that, the mean time of particle residence t_{2} in the cell is again calculated on the basis of the flow velocity and cell size. Then the system of equations of equilibrium chemical kinetics is solved to determine the change in the mixture composition during the time t_{2}. This procedure is repeated for the next cells x_{i} along the x-axis (and residence time t_{i}) up to the substrate surface.
Following Refs [27] and  [28], a mixture of 11 components is considered by solving the equations of equilibrium chemical kinetics: H_{2}, H, CH_{4}, CH_{3}, CH_{2} (ground triplet state), CH_{2}(S) (low singlet level), CH, C, C_{2}H_{2}, C_{3}, and C_{2}H. The computations are performed for 13 forward and backward chemical reactions,
The rate coefficients of forward and backward reactions are calculated on the basis of the data obtained in Ref [29]. They are presented in Appendix B. The behavior of the following species is of significant interest from the viewpoint of activation of the mixture and deposition of the diamond-like film: H, CH_{3}, C, CH_{4}, and C_{2}H_{2}.
IV. RESULTS OF NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS
A. Gas dynamic modeling
DSMC modeling of processes, determining the diamond synthesis in the elaborated scheme, allows obtaining the detailed information on gas-dynamic processes in all running parts of a device that is typical for experiments. According to the scheme of the gas-jet CVD reactor (Fig. 1), x = 0.06 corresponds to the hot tube exit and x = 0.07 is the substrate position. Spatial distributions shown in Figs. 2 and 3 give a general idea about specific features of the considered flow. Figure 2 shows the number density and the streamlines of molecular hydrogen (a), atomic hydrogen (b), and methane (c) for expansion into vacuum. Figure 3 shows the fluxes nV_{x} and translational temperature T for atomic hydrogen and methane. All domains are identified: cold (0.035 ≤ x < 0.045 m) and hot (0.045 ≤ x ≤ 0.06 m) parts of the channel and expansion into vacuum (x > 0.06 m). Each domain of the flow is characterized by its own specific features, in particular, by the degree of rarefaction and nonequilibrium. The degree of rarefaction can be characterized by Knudsen numbers: as an example, for molecular hydrogen at the tube entrance Kn_{s} = L/d = 0.005 (L is the mean free path and d is the tube diameter), at the tube exit Kn_{e} = 0.02, and at the middle of distance tube exit–substrate (L_{sub}) Kn_{sub} = L/L_{sub} = 0.3. Rapid growth of atomic hydrogen amount in the hot part of the channel and its actual absence in the cold part of the channel owing to its rapid recombination after penetration from the hot part of the channel should be noted. Faster spreading of atomic hydrogen as compared to methane in the region behind the tube exit is also worth mentioning. Another specific feature is the higher temperature of methane in the compressed layer owing to acceleration in the previous regions of the flow by lighter components of the mixture (see, e.g., Refs [12] and  [30]). Stream lines of components in Fig. 2 do not coincide in the region between the tube and the substrate. It indicates first of all the separation of components and absence of thermodynamic equilibrium in the flow. The spatial distribution of parameters [Figs. 3(a)–3(d)] discovers strong increasing of temperature of H and CH_{4} near the substrate because of damping of these gases. It should also be noted that the radial distributions of the parameters within the channel size are fairly uniform, which makes it possible to use the one-dimensional 1-D(x) model of chemical kinetics of the components of the H/C mixture.
The influence of background pressure on the flow between the tube and substrate is very essential, which is very important for conditions of deposition processes. Figure 4 reflects it on examples of axial distributions of H_{2}, H, and CH_{4} densities, velocities, and translational temperatures at the background pressure 0 and 20 Torr, and identical hydrogen flow rate (1500 SCCM), the methane fraction (3%), and the length of the hot part of the tube (0.015 m). The deviation from thermodynamic equilibrium is most pronounced on data for temperatures and velocities behind the tube exit. In the case of expansion into vacuum, it is most essential. And at the background pressure 20 Torr, the nonequilibrium in a flow is almost unappreciable, except the immediate proximity to a substrate.
Rapid dissociation of molecular hydrogen due to the heterogeneous reaction in the hot part of the channel [Figs. 4(a) and 4(b)], gradual reduction of the number densities of the initial components of the mixture in the hot part of the channel, and drastic decrease in the number densities of all components during supersonic spreading of the gas into vacuum should be noted. A compressed layer is formed near the substrate; it is characterized by an increase in the number densities and a decrease in the velocities V_{x} of molecular hydrogen and methane. In the compressed layer, the number density of atomic hydrogen decreases and its velocity increases due to the H atom recombination on the substrate that reduces the reflected flux of H atoms. The velocities and temperatures of the considered components inside the tube are close to each other [Figs. 4(c)–4(f)]. The pronounced reduction of molecular hydrogen velocity upstream of a substrate is produced by the flow retardation in a compressed layer, reflection from a substrate, and back flow of H_{2} molecules generated in heterogeneous recombination of H atoms. The significant increase in temperature is observed in the compressed layer, which is especially noticeable for heavy CH_{4} molecules for the case of vacuum and the background pressure 2 Torr. The situation for pressure 20 Torr is different. A denser compressed layer reveals more intensive energy exchange that equalizes temperatures of different components.
Atomic hydrogen plays an important role in the synthesis of diamond structures. The amount of atomic hydrogen in the flow is characterized by the degree of dissociation K = 0.5n_{H}/(n_{H2} + 0.5n_{H}). Here n_{H2} and n_{H} are the densities of molecular and atomic hydrogen. Dissociation depends on the geometry of the channel, transporting the flow to the substrate, and the flow rate. It was elucidated by calculations presented in Fig. 5 for three lengths L of the hot section of the tube, three flow rates of H_{2} (a), and three pressures in the chamber of gas expansion (b). The rapid dissociation of hydrogen in the hot part of the tube and significant influence of the hot tube length L can be noted. For the short hot part of the tube (L = 0.0075 m), the degree of dissociation reaches 34%-49%, depending on the flow rate. As L increases, the degree of dissociation also increases and reaches a certain limiting value. This process is decelerated with increase in the flow rate (i.e., decreasing of the Knudsen number). The influence of the flow rate on dissociation degree (K) is more pronounced for the short hot part of the tube. The value of K rapidly decreases near the substrate. It is determined by superposition of fragment diffusion and mass change on the substrate surface. The pressure growth in the chamber leads to the flow deceleration in the channel followed by increasing the contact time of hydrogen with a channel surface and dissociation degree enlargement to the tube exit.
The atmosphere in a proximity to a substrate is of paramount importance for the deposition itself. The calculated results illustrate the radial non-uniformity of densities (Fig. 6). It testifies the non-uniformity of the growth rate. The growth rate and quality of diamond is determined in some extent by ratio n_{H}/n_{CH4}.
A series of numerical experiments was performed for studying the influence of the pressure in the chamber on the flow. It should be noted that simulations of expansion into a chamber with a high pressure P is time-consuming because it is necessary to take into account the influence of the background gas (in our experiments, molecular hydrogen). For example, the computation time of 30 days was needed for P = 20 Torr (for Intel Core i7-5820 K 4.4 GHz). An increase in pressure up to 2 Torr has a minor effect on the degree of dissociation, whereas the P = 20 Torr regime results in enhancement of the H_{2} dissociation degree similar to the H_{2} dissociation degree in the longer tube. Figure 7 shows the pressure distributions for different tube lengths and different flow rates. Such results are useful by designing of a gas delivering system.
B. Methane decomposition
The analysis of methane chemistry is one of the difficult problems. It is performed with some assumption allowing the evaluation a real situation. The probability of methane molecule decomposition on a hot tungsten surface is low even at high temperatures. A rather exhausting review of these processes is given in Ref [9]. Taking into account the data of Ref [9] in the analysis of methane chemistry in the cylindrical channel justifies the neglected surface reactions for CH_{4} and accentuates the justice of the above-stated one-dimensional approach to calculation of chemistry. Therefore, in the DSMC method, heterogeneous methane reactions with the channel surface were not simulated (Tables II and III). Figure 8 shows the predicted axial distributions of the molar fractions n_{mf} for nine components of the mixture (H_{2}, H, CH_{4}, CH_{3}, CH_{2}, CH_{2}(S), CH, C, and C_{2}H_{2}) for the basic regime Q(H_{2}) = 1500 SCCM, initial mixture 3% CH_{4}/H_{2}, L = 0.015 m, and for expansion into vacuum. The processes in the hot part of the tube include rapid decomposition of the initial gases CH_{4} and H_{2}, followed by rapid conversion of hydrocarbon components activated by atomic hydrogen and high temperature of the mixture. For the case considered in this study, the dominating C_{x}H_{y} fragments are atomic carbon (C) and methyl (CH_{3}), whereas the maximum concentration of acetylene (C_{2}H_{2}) in the compressed layer near the substrate is smaller by an order of magnitude.
Figure 9 shows the species fluxes near the substrate (x = 0.068 m) for various initial mole fractions of methane, background pressures, hydrogen flow rates, and the length of the hot part of a tube. The analysis of this study allows the following conclusions to be drawn.
1. There is a minor change in the relative concentration of molecular and atomic hydrogen due to gas-phase reactions. The most pronounced effect on the rate of change of the component concentrations is produced by the pressure in the channel and hydrogen decomposition on the cylinder surface.
2. Under the present conditions, rapid decomposition of methane in the gas phase occurs, mainly in reaction (1).
3. An increase in the methane concentration in the initial mixture leads to an increase in the amounts of C, CH_{3}, CH_{4}, and C_{2}H_{2.} The most significant growth is observed for C_{2}H_{2}.
4. The background pressure has a considerable effect on the relative concentrations of some components. In particular, an increase in pressure leads to the more significant conversion of methane and to the appreciable reduction of the methyl flux.
5. The decrease in the hydrogen flow rate leads to less intense decomposition of methane.
6. The decrease in the length of the hot part of the channel leads to the decrease of atomic carbon (C) mole fraction and the increase of methane and methyl mole fractions due to their less intense conversions into CH_{x} (x = 0-2).
1. Discussion on results of modeling
DSMC modeling presents reach scope of description transportation and transformation of the gas flow to a surface of deposition taking into account heterogeneous reactions for hydrogen and negligible decomposition of methane on the channel surface. The specific behavior of parameters is determined by gas dynamic processes, complicated by a nonequilibrium phenomenon because of strong gradients in low density flows. Most difficult for explanation and understanding are processes between the source (tube) and substrate. In analysis processes in this region, it is necessary to take into account the presence of longitudinal and transversal gradients of parameters, generating corresponding diffusion flows. Besides, an opposing flow from the substrate surface is generated by the reflected part of fragments and the birth of particles in the result of a chemical reaction on a substrate. It explains peculiarities of parameter behavior in Figs. 4 and 6.
The character of prolonged changing of dissociation degree deserves additional comment. Inside the tube, dissociation increases very fast and strongly depends on a flow rate. Its sharp decreasing behind the tube exit is not a result of recombination. It is explained by radial diffusion devastation of atomic hydrogen and the fast acceleration of atomic hydrogen close to a substrate.
Data on pressure distributions along the flow axis are presented only for expansion into vacuum. The pressure drop is almost proportional to the flow rate and its specific value has weak dependence on tube length. But pressure drop can be changed by the increase of background that follows from the evaluation of pressure on the tube exit in Fig. 7.
The composition of gases transporting to the surface of active fragments is of paramount importance for kinetics of diamond synthesis. Calculations allowed obtain rather complete presentation of atomic hydrogen formation peculiarities, taking into account that it forms mainly in heterogeneous reactions. The role of atomic hydrogen is important by deposition itself, but it is not less important by decomposition of methane. The correct analysis of methane chemistry is a difficult task. In this study, it is performed on the base of the one-dimensional approach with assumption allowing the evaluation of a real situation. The influence of all important parameters has taken into account.
The performed numerical simulation has revealed the complex influence of separate parameters and gas state on flows with accompaniment of synergetic effects. The obtained data allow us to form the strategy of experimental studies of diamond-like film deposition.
V. CONCLUSIONS
The process of deposition of diamond-like structures by the gas-phase method is a multi-parameter problem. Optimal conditions mainly depend on the ratio of concentrations of the atomic hydrogen and fragments of carbon-containing gases impacting onto the substrate surface. The search for optimal deposition modes in experiments is problematic without numerical simulations of reactive gas flow parameters accounting for the various gas-phase and heterogeneous reactions.
The direct simulation Monte Carlo method, which takes into account heterogeneous reactions, is used in the present work. The analysis shows that the radial distributions of flow parameters are fairly uniform over the tube cross sections in our regimes. For this reason, it allows us to use a one-dimensional approach for calculating the changes in the mixture composition along the flow axis by means of solving a set of chemical kinetics equations.
A systematic numerical study of the effects of various reactor parameters (reactor configuration, flow rate, initial mole fraction of methane in the mixture with hydrogen, and pressure in the expansion chamber) on the species concentration distributions in the gas-jet CVD reactor was carried out. The fluxes of various components of the mixture onto the substrate, the degrees of H_{2} and CH_{4} dissociation, and further conversions of hydrocarbon C_{x}H_{y} up to atomic carbon C were calculated and analyzed. The concentrations of C near the substrate in some regimes were higher than the concentrations of CH_{3}. In view of the enhanced reactive capability of carbon atoms [31], high concentrations of C atoms could testify to their dominating role as a gas-phase precursor of deposited carbon films.
The performed analysis is not universal. But even on this stage it allows us to elucidate the condition of some experiments, mentioned in references, and express some general recommendation. The developed method can be applied to solve similar problems for rarefied nonequilibrium flows in high temperature channels.

Axial distributions of the H_{2} dissociation degree for the initial mixture 3% CH_{4}/H_{2} in the case of expansion: into vacuum at lengths of the hot part of the tube L = 0.0075, 0.015, and 0.03 m and flow rates Q = 750, 1500, and 3000 SCCM (a); into different background pressure at length of the hot part of the tube L = 0.015 m and flow rate Q = 1500 SCCM (b).
FIG. 6. 
Radial distributions of H_{2}, H, and CH_{4} number densities close to the substrate for background pressures: (a) 0 and (b) 20 Torr. The hydrogen flow rate is 1500 SCCM, the methane fraction is 3%, and the length of the hot part of the tube is 0.015 m.
FIG. 7. 
Pressure distributions along the flow axis for different lengths of the hot part of the tube. The hydrogen flow rates are 750, 1500, and 3000 SCCM; the 3% CH_{4}/H_{2} mixture is expanded into vacuum.
FIG. 8. 
Distributions of the molar fractions of the mixture components along the flow axis. The hydrogen flow rate is 1500 SCCM, L = 0.015 m; the 3% CH_{4}/H_{2} mixture is expanded into vacuum.
FIG. 9. 
Specific flux nV for four components of the mixture. (a) The expansion into vacuum. The methane fraction is 1%, 3%, and 10%. The hydrogen flow rate is 1500 SCCM. The length of the hot part of the tube L = 0.015 m. (b) Different background pressures (0, 2, and 20 Torr). The methane fraction is 3%, the hydrogen flow rate is 1500 SCCM, and L = 0.015 m. (c) The expansion into vacuum. The methane concentration is 3%, hydrogen flow rates are 750, 1500, and 3000 SCCM, and L = 0.015 m. (d) The expansion into vacuum. The methane concentration is 3%, the hydrogen flow rate is 1500 SCCM, and L = 0.0075, 0.015, and 0.03 m.
