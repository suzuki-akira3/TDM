A new perspective for analyzing complex band structures of phononic crystals
Rewriting the formulation of the Bloch waves, this paper presents a new perspective for analyzing the complex band structures of the in-plane waves in 2D phononic crystals. Using the proposed formulation, a new finite element based method is developed for analyzing 2D periodic systems. The results of the validation example prove that the proposed method can provide exact solutions for both the real and complex band structures of 2D periodic systems. Furthermore, using the proposed method, the complex band structures of a 2D periodic structure are calculated. The physical meanings of the obtained complex band structures are discussed by performing the wave mode analysis.
I. INTRODUCTION
Phononic crystals (PCs) are typical periodic systems made of two or more materials with different physical properties [1]. A main feature of PCs is the band gap, in which no propagative Bloch waves exist, or in other words, all waves are evanescent [2]. On this basis, many applications can be designed, such as energy trapping, waveguides, acoustic filtering, and lenses [3–10].
Extensive research studies have been conducted to explore the dispersion properties and the corresponding frequency band structures of PCs by experimental, analytical, and numerical methods [11–16]. In general, there are two types of formulations for computing the band structures. The first type of formulation [17–25] assumes a real wave vector k located in the first irreducible Brillouin zone, and then solves an eigenvalue problem to obtain a complex frequency ω=ω^{R}+iω^{I}, where the ω^{R} in the real part is the vibration frequency of the free propagating wave and ω^{I} in the imaginary part measures the temporal decay of the wave amplitude. This formulation is commonly known as the ω(k) formulation [2]. For example, Cheng et_al [17] calculated the band structure of a one-dimensional layered periodic composite using the plane wave expansion (PWE) method. Using the well-known techniques in structural dynamics, Hussein and Frazier [18,19] studied the Bloch wave propagation problem and the effects of damping on the frequency band structure of solid/solid periodic systems. Besides, Hussein and Frazier [20] also studied the dispersion properties of a viscously damped locally resonant metamaterial. Reda et_al [21] constructed effective first and second order grade continuum models to predict the dispersion properties of three-dimensional (3D) composite structures in the low frequency range. They [22] also analyzed the propagation of nonlinear waves in homogenized periodic hexagonal networks. Reda and his co-workers [23,24] computed the complex band structure of 2D and 3D dissipative periodic systems modeled as viscoelastic Bernoulli beam-lattices. They also compared the results with those obtained by the homogenization technique [25–28].
The second type of formulation [29–38] assumes a real frequency ω and then solves the complex wave number k as an eigenvalue problem, i.e., k=k^{R}+ik^{I}, where the real part, k^{R}, represents the propagation property of the wave mode, while the imaginary part, k^{I}, measures the attenuation property of the wave mode. Therefore, the mode is evanescent and wave propagation is time-harmonic [2]. This formulation is known as the k(ω) formulation. For example, the propagating and evanescent properties in PCs have been investigated extensively using the extended plane wave expansion (EPWE) method [29–34]. In addition to the EPWE method, the Finite Element Method (FEM) is another common approach for computing the complex dispersion properties of periodic systems [2,35,36]. Due to the Floquet-Bloch theorem, one just needs to perform the computation of infinite periodic structures through modeling of a representative cell by the FEM [35]. Besides, Cheng et_al [37] investigated the dispersion differences and consistency of artificial periodic structures by using the extended lumped-mass method. Cheng and his coworkers [38] also extended the differential quadrature element method to study the complex relations and the evanescent wave modes in periodic beams.
These two formulations are fundamental for correctly understanding the free and time-harmonic waves propagating in PCs. The ω(k) formulation considers a complex frequency ω and a real wave vector k, which means the amplitude shows an exponential decay with time. Therefore, it can be used to analyze the response of periodic structures under impulse excitations [2]. On the other hand, the k(ω) formulation considers a real ω but a complex k, which represents an exponential decay of the amplitude with space. Therefore, it can be used to analyze the response of periodic structures under harmonic excitations [2] which is common in engineering vibration applications [39].
In the k(ω) formulation, for any given real frequency ω and unit direction e_{k} of the wave vector k, the wave vector k can be obtained through solving a characteristic equation and expressed as k=k^{R}e_{k}+ik^{I}e_{k}. This means that the real part k^{R} and imaginary part k^{I} of the wave vector are actually parallel under this formulation. However, when considering two-dimensional and three-dimensional periodic systems, k^{R} and k^{I} may not necessarily be parallel with each other. The application of this formulation to periodic systems with complex wave vector and band structures is not well studied [40]. A formulation that can facilitate systematic analysis of such evanescent waves is needed. This paper proposes a new formulation that can capture such kind of Bloch waves and provide exact solutions for both the real and complex band structures in periodic systems.
The present work is organized as follows: Section II briefly reviews the Floquet-Bloch theorem and the commonly-used k(ω) formulation for periodic systems. Section III presents the proposed new formulation that can account for the intersection between k^{R} and k^{I}, and the developed FEM based numerical method for calculating the complete band structure of periodic systems. Section IV validates the proposed formulation through analyzing the classical band structures. The calculation and validation of the complex band structure with the intersection between the propagation and attenuation directions are also presented. Finally, some conclusions are summarized in Sec. V.
II. FLOQUET-BLOCH THEOREM
For an isotropic, inhomogeneous, infinite periodic system with linear elasticity, the governing equation can be written as
where r is the position vector, ρ(r) is the mass density at r, λ(r) and μ(r) are the Lamé constants, u is the displacement vector, I is the second order identity tensor, and ∇ represents the gradient operator. Based on the Bloch's theorem, the displacement field for eigenmodes can be expressed as
where U_{k,ω}(r) is the wave-amplitude function which is periodic about the unit cell and is determined by the eigen-pair (k,ω).
Substituting Eq. (2) into Eq. (1) results in a characteristic determinant problem for the eigen-pair (k,ω) with respect to the eigenmode U_{k,ω}(r). To solve this problem numerically, the wave-amplitude U_{k,ω}(r) can be discretized as the sum of the products of discretization coefficients and the corresponding discretization functions (e.g., the shape function for FEM, harmonic function for PWE method). Then, utilizing the Galerkin's method (FEM) or orthogonality between discretization functions (PWE), one can obtain a characteristic system with the array of discretization coefficients as its eigenvector for the eigen-pair (k,ω). Setting the determinant of the above system equal to zero leads to the following eigenvalue equation
To solve this equation, additional assumptions are needed, because there is more than one unknown in this scalar equation. For instance, the k(ω) formulation typically assumes a certain direction e_{k} for the wave vector k at a given frequency ω, leaving just one variable to be solved, i.e., the modulus k of vector k. In general, the modulus k is a complex number, and the wave vector can be expressed as
where k^{R} and k^{I} are collinear. On the other hand, transformation of the real part of the wave vector (i.e., k^{R}) by an arbitrary reciprocal lattice vector in the reciprocal space will lead to a newly formed real part, denoted as k¯{R}, which might not be parallel with the invariable imaginary part k^{I} in 2D or 3D situations. This makes it reasonable for the existence of a class of evanescent modes with the real and imaginary part of the wave vector initially unparalleled. This paper will focus on studying the propagation of this type of waves in periodic systems.
III. A NEW FORMULATION
In this section, assuming the real and imaginary parts of the wave vector to be unparalleled, we establish a new formulation to capture the evanescent modes possibly existing in periodic structures. Here, the real part of the complex wave number K is assumed to be independent of the imaginary part of the complex wave number c. Then, we can rewrite Eqs. (4) and (2), respectively, as
The intersection angle between them is defined as the “attenuation angle” and denoted by θ.
Similar to the k(ω) formulation given in Sec. II, we can establish a characteristic system with (K,c,ω) being the set of eigenvalues. The array of discretization coefficients for the amplitude function U_{K,c,ω}(r) forms the eigenvector. Finally, the characteristic equation becomes
Next, a numerical method is developed for solving the characteristic Eq. (7). If variables K, θ, and ω can be assumed to be known beforehand, then the attenuation factor c can be solved. In particular, to obtain the complete band structure of a periodic system, for each arbitrary combination (K,ω) with K located in the first Brillouin zone and ω scanned in a range of interest, we need to evaluate many values of the attenuation angle θ in the range of [0,2π], which makes the solution process computationally expensive. To simplify the problem, the geometrical symmetry of the lattice can be exploited. To illustrate this, a common 2D square lattice is considered, as shown in Fig. 1(a). Figure 1(b) shows the corresponding irreducible Brillouin zone, where the dashed arrows represent the attenuation direction e_{c}. As can be seen in Fig. 1(b), assuming that there is one eigenmode with the real wave vector along the ΓX or ΓM border, an attenuation vector c can be introduced at a circular frequency ω for the governing equation in Eq. (1). The corresponding attenuation angle and the amplitude mode field can be denoted by θ and U(r), respectively. Also, we denote the mode field symmetrical with U(r) about the wave vector as Ũ(r), and the attenuation vector symmetrical with c as c̃, as shown in Fig. 1(b). Then, according to the symmetry of the structure about the wave vector, the displacement mode characterized by the attenuation vector c̃, the circular frequency ω, and the amplitude mode field Ũ(r), also satisfies the governing Eq. (1). Therefore, for the real wave vector along the symmetrical direction of the unit cell, the attenuation angle just needs to be swept in [0,π/2] to capture the complete dispersion properties for the system. When K is on the XM border or in the irreducible Brillouin zone, the symmetry of the unit cell with respect to the wave direction e_{K} is broken. Therefore, θ must be evaluated at all the values within [−π/2,π/2] to capture all possible evanescent modes.
It should be noted that, given a set of values for K, θ, ω, the solution of Eq. (7) will most likely be complex, i.e., c=c^{R}+ic^{I}, and the solution for vector c can be expressed as
where c^{R} is parallel with c^{I}. Substituting Eq. (8) into (5) leads to
From Eq. (9), it is clear that the real part c^{R} represents the true attenuation vector, while the imaginary part c^{I} should be attributed to the wave vector as K−c^{I}, which most likely intersects with c^{R}. Therefore, the attenuation angle is always not equal to the predefined θ anymore, and needs to be recalculated.
Following the above strategy, a finite element based method is constructed for the calculations. The details can be found in the Appendix.
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
In this section, the band structure of a 2D periodic system is calculated based on the developed numerical method and compared with the existing results obtained by the traditional FEM to validate the new formulation. The calculation and validation of the complex band structure with intersection between the propagation and attenuation directions are also performed.
A. Real band structure
Here, a 2D square-lattice periodic system consisting of concrete piles and soil considered by Huang and Shi [41], as shown in Fig. 1, is studied. In the following simulation, the periodic constant of the pile-soil system and the radius of the pile are taken as a=2m and r=0.65m, respectively. The physical parameters of the pile-soil system are given in Table I.
In order to compare with the real band diagram obtained in Ref [41], we confine the wave vector K along the boundary of the irreducible zone [Fig. 1(b)] and set the attenuation angles θ to be zero. Then, we select the (K,ω) arrays where at least one zero solution of the attenuation factors c exists. This means that the eigen-pairs (K,ω) can characterize a propagative mode without any attenuation in space and should fall on a real band. Following this idea, the selected data and comparison are shown in Fig. 2, where the y-axis is the normalized frequency Ω=ωa/(2πc_{t}), where c_{t} is the shear wave velocity of the matrix material.
It can be seen in Fig. 2 that the selected discrete points (scatters) agree well with the existing band structure (solid lines) in Ref [41] obtained by the traditional FEM. This means that the developed numerical method can give a complete and accurate description of the real band structure, which confirms the accuracy and validity of the proposed method. Therefore, it can be used for predicting the band gaps of periodic systems, and furthermore computing the complex band structures.
B. Complex band structure in the ΓX direction
This section discusses the computation of complex bands in the ΓX direction for in-plane polarized Bloch waves using the proposed numerical method. Note that the traditional k(ω) formulation corresponds to a special case of the proposed method when θ=0.
Figure 3 shows the results. In particular, in order to better understand the complex band structures, the propagating and evanescent modes can be classified as four types of modes [31]: (i) modes characterized by values of wavenumber K in the Brillouin zone and attenuation factor c=0 (shown by black filled circles), which correspond to the real band structures; (ii) modes characterized by c>0 and K=0 (shown by filled diamonds), which represent connections between propagating bands at the Γ point; (iii) modes characterized by c>0 and K=π/a (shown by hollow squares), which represent connections between propagating bands at the X point; and (iv) modes with K in the first Brillouin zone but with c≠0 (shown by filled triangles). Figure 4 shows the details of the relatively complicated band structure in the shaded areas of Fig. 3. It is obvious in Fig. 4 that the fifth real band connects with the seventh through the complex band B_{1}B_{2}, which means these two real bands will have the same symmetry in the displacement field [31]. This is verified by the displacement field shown in Fig. 5.
The dispersion diagrams mentioned above are exactly the same with the ones calculated by the traditional k(ω) formulation. In addition to the special case where the wave and attenuation directions are identical, the proposed method can also calculate the complex bands for which the two characteristic directions cross each other by tuning θ to be nonzero. This corresponds to a very complicated case because numerous complex solutions exist, which would alter the initially given wave direction and attenuation angle in a complex fashion. Therefore, a large number of eigenvalues need to be considered to obtain the real attenuation factors. In this paper, 800 eigenvalues are considered.
C. The band structure of the nonzero attenuation angle
1. Calculation of the band structure
Before exploring the complex band structure for the cases with nonzero attenuation angle, we first discuss the traditional k(ω) formulation in more detail. As shown in Fig. 6, assuming an initial wave direction e_{k} along ΓH, we can solve the real part of the wave vector, k^{R}=ΓH, at some given frequencies. Obviously, ΓH is beyond the first Brillouin zone ΓH{1}. We can transform it back to ΓH{1} by a reciprocal lattice vector G_{1}. However, this will lead to a nonzero attenuation angle θ_{1}. Actually, we can transform ΓH to the corresponding position of any Brillouin zone, for example, ΓH{2} with attenuation angle θ_{2}, as shown in Fig. 6. This means that the traditional k(ω) formulation can also result in propagations with nonzero attenuation angles and it can be used to obtain the solutions as well. However, the challenge of using the traditional k(ω) formulation for these cases is that it cannot reach all the cases with randomly specified K and θ, for example, for the case when the attenuation and wave directions are along different symmetry directions. For instance, if we take e_{c} along ΓX′ and e_{K} along ΓM, then the initial wave direction e_{k} for the k(ω) formulation must be given along the ΓX′ direction to reach this case. Besides, the solution for the real wave vector k^{R} should also fall on the ΓM direction, which leads to a series of discrete real wavenumber solutions k^{R} along ΓX′ (e.g., 0, 2π/a, 4π/a, 6π/a, …) and along ΓM (e.g., 0, 22π/a, 42π/a, 62π/a, …). Obviously, these discrete solutions cannot encompass all the cases with e_{c} along ΓX′ and e_{K} along ΓM. More specifically, consider the case with wave vector K equal to ΓM, e_{c} along ΓX′, and attenuation angle of π/4. From the above analysis, we know that this case cannot be achieved by the traditional k(ω) formulation. However, this case can be calculated using the proposed method in this paper by setting θ=π/4 and K=ΓM.
Figure 7 shows the results obtained by the proposed method. The solid lines in the left panel represent the real band along the ΓM direction, the hollow squares in the right panel represent modes with the wave vector K equal to ΓM, while the attenuation along the ΓX′ direction. It can be observed that complex bands exist in each of the directional attenuation zones, which connect the real bands of different orders in the attenuation axis.
In fact, the numerical method developed in this paper can calculate dispersions with any different combination of wave and attenuation directions, and the proposed formulation can cover more extensive evanescent modes potentially existing in periodic structures.
2. Validation of the band structure
The above section discussed the calculation of the complex band structure at the attenuation angle of π/4. Next, in this section, we will discuss the verification of the corresponding eigenmode through harmonic response analysis of a soil-pile system as shown in Fig. 8. In this study, we choose the eigenmode represented by hollow up-pointing triangles in Fig. 7 as the target mode to be activated in the structure. The corresponding characteristic data are shown in Table II.
Figure 9 shows the total amplitude of the target eigenmode (|UK,c,ω,x(r)|{2}+|UK,c,ω,y(r)|{2}) normalized to its maximum. The arrows correspond to the normalized vectors, (|U_{k,ω,x}(r)|,|U_{k,ω,y}(r)|)/U_{max}, where U_{max} is the maximum amplitude.
Next, a soil-pile system with dimensions of a×(l+m) as shown in Fig. 8, is investigated, where ABCD(a×l,2×20m{2}) is the soil-pile structure with the same periodic constants and physical parameters as before, and CDEF(a×m,2×6m{2}) is a Perfectly Matched Layer (PML) [42] used to absorb the incident waves to the boundary CD.
To excite the target mode shown in Fig. 9, we use the frequency domain solver of the commercial software Comsol Multiphysics to obtain the harmonic response for the soil-pile structure. The Floquet periodicity is considered on the boundaries AD and BC
The prescribed displacement on AB is
where K_{x}=π/a according to Table II and U_{AB}(x) is the amplitude function along the input boundary AB.
Obviously, the amplitude function U_{AB}(x) is critical for exciting the eigenmode accurately in the structure. Ideally, U_{AB}(x) should be chosen as close to the modal analysis result as possible. Therefore, we extract the amplitude data along the boundary AB through the modal analysis in Fig. 9, and then take it as the amplitude input U_{AB}(x) for the soil-pile structure in Fig. 8. This way, we can correctly excite the target eigenmode. Figure 10 shows the comparison of the input data with the modal analysis results, and close matches are observed.
From the boundary conditions in Eqs. (10) and (11), it can be seen that the Floquet periodicity and input displacement will have fluctuations in the x-direction. Note that for the response in the y-axis, the fluctuation and attenuation phenomena might occur simultaneously, which could eventually lead to departure of the attenuation direction from the propagation direction. Under the above boundary conditions, the results for the harmonic response are shown in Figs. 11 and 12.
Figure 11 shows the total normalized amplitude of the displacement field decaying along the y-axis. Figure 12 shows the comparison of the amplitude contours. Figure 12(a) is the modal analysis result, and Figs. 12(b)–12(d) are the harmonic analysis results for the first, second, and third rows of the piles in Fig. 11, respectively. As expected, the contours of the harmonic analysis in Fig. 12 are similar to the modal analysis result, except for the decaying feature. This similarity becomes more evident for piles after the second row. This demonstrates the dominance of the target mode at the attenuation angle π/4 in the harmonic response in Fig. 11.
Based on the decaying total amplitude of the displacement field along the y-axis in Fig. 11, we fitted an exponential function using some data points, which is shown in Fig. 13. It can be seen that the fitted attenuation factor |c| of |c|{fitted}=0.1441 is very close to the modal analysis result (as shown in Table II) of |c|=0.14554, with only a relative error around 1%. This verifies the dominance of the target eigenmode in the harmonic response of the soil-pile system in Fig. 11. As a result, we have obtained the harmonic response dominated by the target mode in the structure, which demonstrates that the eigenmodes with nonzero attenuation angles can be achieved in the structure by defining some particular boundary conditions.
V. CONCLUSIONS
In this work, a new formulation for calculating the complex band structures of PCs was proposed. With the help of the commercial finite element software, a new numerical method was developed based on the proposed formulation for 2D periodic systems. The dispersion properties of a 2D periodic system are studied in detail using the developed method. From the results, the following conclusions can be drawn.
(1) The developed method provides a complete and accurate description of the real band structure, and thus can be used to predict the band gaps for periodic systems.
(2) The developed method is capable of computing the complex bands of periodic systems completely and accurately.
(3) The developed method can calculate the dispersions of different attenuation and wave directions, justifying the generalization of the proposed formulation, and providing a new view in understanding the evanescent modes possibly present in the periodic structures.
(5) The eigenmodes with nonzero attenuation angles can be obtained in the harmonic response of the structure under some particular boundary conditions.
APPENDIX: CONSTRUCTION OF THE NUMERICAL METHOD
The numerical method is constructed using the PDE (Partial Difference Equation) module of the commercial software Comsol Multiphysics, and implemented in a representative unit cell considering the periodicity of the PCs. The PDE module is an application mode for equation-based modeling. In this paper, we mainly use its Coefficient form for linear or almost linear PDE formulations under an Eigenvalue study, for which the standard eigenvalue equation is
Here, Λ is the scalar eigenvalue to be solved, U is the corresponding eigenmode, f is the external force term which can actually be removed unless it is related with the eigenvalue Λ. Other bold symbols represent coefficient tensors confirmed by the governing equation of the corresponding eigenvalue problem.
According to the formulation demonstrated in Sec. III, it is obvious that the attenuation factor c corresponds to Λ in A1, and the periodic wave amplitude function u_{K,c,ω}(r) represents the eigenmode U. Therefore, the Periodic Condition is applied to pairs of opposite boundaries of the unit cell. Now substituting Eq. (6) into Eq. (1), after some tedious mathematical manipulations, we can compare the final results with the standard expression in (A1) and derive the formation of each coefficient tensor. It is found that the coefficient tensors are related not only to the material parameters, but also to the given eigenvalue set (K,θ,ω) and unknown eigenvalue Λ, i.e., the attenuation factor c.
Considering a common 2D problem, we can write K=Kcosφi+Ksinφj, where K is the modulus of K and φ is its intersection angle with the x axis. Then, the nonzero coefficients in Eq. (A1) are obtained, i.e.,
With the above formulation, the solver can solve the eigenvalue problem of Eq. (A1).
