The effect of Ga pre-deposition on Si (111) surface for InAs nanowire selective area hetero-epitaxy
Vertical InAs nanowires (NWs) grown on a Si substrate are promising building-blocks for next generation vertical gate-all-around transistor fabrication. We investigate the initial stage of InAs NW selective area epitaxy (SAE) on a patterned Si (111) substrate with a focus on the interfacial structures. The direct epitaxy of InAs NWs on a clean Si (111) surface is found to be challenging. The yield of vertical InAs NWs is low, as the SAE is accompanied by high proportions of empty holes, inclined NWs, and irregular blocks. In contrast, it is improved when the NW contains gallium, and the yield of vertical In_{x}Ga_{1-x}As NWs increased with higher Ga content. Meanwhile, unintentional Ga surface contamination on a patterned Si substrate induces high yield vertical InAs NW SAE, which is attributed to a GaAs-like seeding layer formed at the InAs/Si interface. The role of Ga played in the III-V NW nucleation on Si is further discussed. It stabilizes the B-polarity on a non-polar Si (111) surface and enhances the nucleation. Therefore, gallium incorporation on a Si surface is identified as an important enabler for vertical InAs NW growth. A new method for high yield (>99%) vertical InAs NW SAE on Si using an InGaAs nucleation layer is proposed based on this study.
I. INTRODUCTION
Narrow bandgap InAs is a promising candidate for channel materials of next-generation electrical devices due to its high electron mobility. Recent demonstrations of In(Ga)As gate-all-around field effect transistors, adopting the In(Ga)As nanowire (NW) structure as a channel, show encouraging performance [1–7]. Regarding the geometry, the vertical NW structure is more desirable, since it provides a new dimension and relieves the pressure in gate length scaling. III-V vertical NWs are grown on a Si (111) substrate with a small footprint. Hence, the anti-phase boundary in III-V epitaxial layers can be avoided [8], and the misfit dislocations are confined at the III-V/Si interface underneath the “bottom-up” vertical architecture [9]. High crystalline quality can thus be obtained and the challenge of the large lattice mismatch between the III-V epi-layer and the Si substrate is circumvented.
In the context of electrical device applications, a self-catalyzed or catalyst-free approach is more suitable instead of the widely studied Au catalyzed growth [10,11], since it avoids the possible metallic contaminant incorporation [12,13]. So far, there are many reports on self-assisted random InAs NW epitaxy on a Si (111) substrate by using thin oxide layers. In this case, the oxide layer thickness (0.9–4 nm) is critical for the NW growth [14–21]. In contrast, the selective-area epitaxy (SAE) method, which is more suitable for high volume manufacturing, utilizes a patterned mask on a Si substrate, and the NWs grow directly on the pre-defined Si surface either by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) [22,23] or metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) [2,9,24–28]. In SA-MOVPE, it has been demonstrated that the nucleation of In(Ga)As is highly dependent on the pre-treatments of the Si surface before the growth, that is, the initial status of the Si (111) surface [9,29]. For InAs NW SAE, a Si surface baked at 900 °C can only produce around 31% vertical NWs, while a large number of inclined NWs and empty holes co-exist [9]. This suggests a mixed and metastable polarity on the Si (111) surface before the InAs growth (Si itself has a non-polar nature). Instead, sophisticated pretreatment (arsenic low temperature pretreatment and flow-rate modulation step) is proposed, and the yield is thus increased significantly [9]. Nevertheless, in some other works, the high yield of InAs NWs can be grown without any issue, even if the Si surface is pretreated at much lower temperatures in either a H_{2} or an arsenic environment [25,26,28]. This indicates that further understanding about the early stage of InAs NW SAE with a well-controlled Si surface is needed.
In this work, we study the role of gallium (Ga) in the initial stage of InAs NW SA-MOVPE on a Si (111) surface. The SAE of InAs NWs directly on a clean Si (111) surface is first studied. The importance of Ga incorporation in the yield of vertical NWs is evidenced in In_{x}Ga_{1-x}As NW SAE on a patterned Si (111) substrate, and its role is further demonstrated by an In_{x}Ga_{1-x}As island growth experiment on the bare Si (111) substrate. Besides, the interesting observation of the “accidental” high yield InAs NW SAE is explained within this framework. Finally, we present a new method to obtain high yield (>99%) InAs NW SAE on a Si (111) substrate using an InGaAs nucleation layer.
II. EXPERIMENTAL
A 15 nm SiO_{2} layer was first formed on the Si (111) substrate (miscut < 0.3°) at 900 °C under dry O_{2} after 2% HF wet etching and cleaning. The mask was then patterned by 193 nm-immersion (193 nm-i) lithographic technology. The opening holes with diameters ranging from 200 to 350 nm were formed directly by 2% HF wet etching. For each opening size, there are arrays with three different pitches, whose ratio to the diameter is 1.25:1, 1.5:1 and 5:1, respectively. They are termed as dense, semi-dense and isolated arrays, respectively, in the following paragraphs. Meanwhile, a template with a hole diameter around 50 nm and a pitch around 300 nm was also prepared using a more complex process flow (Strato mask, supplementary material A). Prior to the growth, the samples were cleaned by a buffered HF (BHF) treatment (water diluted 5% HF:NH_{4}F = 1:7, 1 min) to remove the native oxide, and were loaded immediately into the load-lock afterwards. InAs, GaAs and In_{x}Ga_{1-x}As NWs were selectively grown on patterned 300 mm Si (111) wafers by an MOVPE system (300 mm Aixtron Crius, denoted as tool A). The reaction chamber was in-situ pre-cleaned with HCl before each run at high temperatures to remove any remaining contamination [30]. As a comparison, another MOVPE (Thomas Swan, denoted as tool B) without an in-situ pre-cleaning system was also used for NW SAE on small pieces. Trimethylindium (TMIn), trimethylgallium (TMGa), and tertiary butylarsine (TBAs) were used as precursors, and the carrier gas was H_{2} (with a flow rate of 48 standard liter per minute (slm) for A and 19.6 slm for B). The temperature was measured by emissivity-corrected reflectometry for both tools, and the reactor pressure was 76 Torr. The schematic diagram of the basic growth recipe for InAs NW SAE is shown in Fig. 1(a). Before the main growth step, a high temperature baking step (730–900 °C) under H_{2} for 10 min was always conducted to remove any remaining native oxide in the active area [31]. Detailed discussion about the oxide removal can be found in Sec. III B. Afterwards, the temperature was lowered to 400 °C and the group V precursor was injected for Si surface preparation (5 min) [9]. The temperature was increased again to the growth temperature and the group III precursor(s) was introduced to initiate the NW growth (growth time varied from 30 s to 60 min). After the main growth step, the sample was cooled down in the group V environment till 400 °C to avoid material decomposition. More information about the InAs growth recipe can be found elsewhere [32].
The morphology of NWs was inspected by an FEI NOVA 200 and an SEMVision scanning electron microscope (SEM). All tilted view SEM pictures were taken at 45°. Time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOFSIMS) was performed with a TOFSIMS IV from ION-TOF GmbH. Both positive and negative ion profiles were measured in a dual beam configuration using a Bi^{3+} (25 kV, current 0.4 pA, impact angle 45°) gun for analysis and an Xe (350 eV) gun for sputtering. The interlaced mode was used, where the sputter beam was active between analysis pulses, so that both guns could operate quasi-simultaneously and quasi-continuously. High resolution X-ray diffraction (HR-XRD) was conducted using a PANalytical X'pert PRO diffractometer equipped with a copper Kα X-ray source and a four-bounce Ge (220) monochromator. Grazing-incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) was performed at the beamline BM25B of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), Grenoble, with a photon energy of 15 keV [33]. High angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) measurements were carried out on an FEI Titan system working at 300 kV with an EDX spectrometer. The TEM specimens were prepared by a focused ion beam (FIB) using Ga^{+} ions.
III. CHALLENGE OF InAs NW SAE ON A CLEAN Si (111) SURFACE
A. Direct SAE of InAs NWs on a Si (111) surface
InAs NWs were first grown on tool A by the epitaxial steps depicted in Fig. 1(a); no additional special pre-treatment (such as the flow-rate modulation step) was used [9,25,32]. However, it is found that the vertical InAs NW yield is low, with a large proportion of holes remaining empty [an example can be seen in Fig. 3(a)]. Efforts were made to increase the vertical InAs NW yield. In the main growth step, a large range of growth parameters (growth temperature 490–610 °C, TMIn flow rate 1–23 μmol/min, TBAs flow rate 370–1470 μmol/min, and growth pressure 15–152 Torr) have been explored and a low temperature InAs seeding layer has been attempted. The conditions for other steps were kept the same. Only a moderate improvement could be obtained with these efforts. The proportion of empty holes decreases if a high TMIn flow rate or low growth temperatures is used, though the number of irregular blocks increases simultaneously and the overall vertical NW yield is not improved. The highest vertical NW yield observed in these experiments is around 30%. Inclined InAs NWs as well as irregular blocks also occasionally appear, which is comparable to the results reported by Tomioka et_al [9]
The formation of inclined NWs and irregular blocks evidences the key challenge of InAs SAE on Si. Typical SEM pictures of these two structures are shown in Figs. 1(b) and 1(c), respectively. The inclined NW growth can be explained by the tetrahedral structure of the ⟨111⟩ system, which is illustrated in Fig. 1(d). Since InAs NW growth front is always the (111)B surface, any growth starting from a (111)A substrate would end up with the inclined NW grown in one of the three ⟨11¯1¯⟩ directions, at an angle of around 19° with regard to the (111) surface. The coexistence of inclined and vertical NWs indicates that the Si surface can be both (111)A and (111)B equivalent at the beginning of the growth, which is related to the nonpolar nature of Si. This is revealed by the schematic ball-and-stick diagram presented in Figs. 1(e) and 1(f), where In, As and Si atoms are shown as green, red and black balls, respectively. The surface is (111)B equivalent when the initial surface is As-terminated Si^{3+} or In-terminated Si^{1+}. In these cases, the NW growth front (gradient blue lines) is in parallel with the Si (111) surface and vertical NWs are formed. In contrast, if the interface is In-terminated Si^{3+} or As-terminated Si^{1+}, the surface is (111)A equivalent, and the NW has to follow one of the inclined ⟨11¯1¯⟩ growth directions [Fig. 1(f)]. The irregular blocks have a complex shape without well-defined facets. They are related to the coalescence of multiple nuclei. Hillock-like structures have been reported in InAs NW SAE on Si when the opening size is large (diameter of 600 nm), which is attributed to the tremendous amount of coalescence that occurred on the relatively large surface areas, forming many steps and kinks within the openings [34]. Besides, the mixing of A and B polarity on the Si (111) surface could also contribute to the irregular block growth [35]. It is well known that the coalescence of inversion domains introduces additional abnormal facets and hillocks [36–38].
Therefore, the challenge of polar-on-nonpolar growth needs to be addressed for InAs SAE. That is why, the flow-rate modulation mode (FMM) step^{9} was proposed before the main growth step, where group-V and group-III precursors were injected separately in short periodicity with tens of cycles. However, little improvement was observed by using this method in our experiment (supplementary material B). It should be noticed though that the opening sizes used here are relatively large compared with those used in Ref [9]. Nevertheless, a similar low yield growth was observed in the InAs NW SAE on the template with smaller dimensions (Strato). This difference with the literature could be due to the setup/parameter mismatch between the tools. Furthermore, a variety of other pre-growth treatments were attempted, such as the indium/arsenic/phosphorus pre-flow; yet, none leads to a distinguishable improvement in the vertical NW yield. It is still not clear how to stabilize the polarity on the Si (111) surface at the beginning of InAs NW SAE.
B. Si (111) surface before NW growth
Because the interfacial bonding structure is critical for the vertical NW growth, it is worth taking a closer look at the Si (111) surface before NW SAE. First, the presence of oxide on the Si surface can be excluded. In the InAs SAE experiment, the samples were loaded into the load-lock immediately after the BHF wet etching. Any regrown native oxide during the short re-exposure to air before the loading would be removed by the baking step in H_{2} up to 900 °C prior to the main growth steps [31]. Actually, the impact of the thin oxide layer on Si (111) on InAs NW growth is ambiguous. Counter-intuitively, the remaining thin oxide on the Si surface, if in proper thickness, could improve the yield of vertical InAs NWs. We conducted a series of InAs NW growth on a SAE mask with the Si surface covered by either thin thermal oxide or native oxide. A recipe developed for high density InAs NW self-assisted growth was used here. It is found that vertical InAs NWs (up to 30%–40%) can be obtained on the Si surface covered by either kind of oxide with optimized thickness using this reference recipe. In contrast, the NW yield becomes nearly zero, if the thickness of oxide layer is further reduced (supplementary material C). It is similar to the widely reported self-assisted InAs NW epitaxy on the Si (111) substrate by the aid of an ultra-thin oxide layer [14–21]. Therefore, it is confirmed that the opened Si surface is oxide-free, and it distinguishes our work from the self-assisted NW epitaxy.
To further analyze the Si (111) surface prior to the InAs NW growth step, especially the presence of III-V elements, TOFSIMS mapping at the specified patterned area as shown in Fig. 2(a) was performed ex-situ after the H_{2} baking step. The presence of III-V elements of interest (Ga^{+}, In^{+} and As^{+}) was studied, and O^{–} and C^{–} ions were also probed as a reference. The integrated counts of these ions from a defined region in the semi-dense area are presented in Fig. 2(b) by red bars. It is obvious that the counts of the III-V ions are much (>3 decade) lower than that of O^{–} ions. Because the integration region covers a large area in the semi-dense array, the O^{–} ions are mainly from the SiO_{2} mask. Nevertheless, one should notice that the ratio between the SiO_{2} covered area and the opened Si area is only around 2 within the semi-dense region, which is much smaller than the obtained ratio between O^{–} and III-V ions. In the meantime, the counts of III-V ions are also much smaller than that of C^{–} (it should be noticed that C^{–} can be introduced by exposure to air during the ex-situ TOFSIMS experiment [39]). Therefore, there is no notable III-V contamination on the Si surface before the NW growth step, which is the result of the in-situ HCl pre-cleaning. In summary, we confirm a clean Si (111) surface prior to the InAs NW growth. It is surprisingly challenging to obtain a high yield InAs NW SAE on such a surface.
IV. EFFECT OF GALLIUM INCORPORATION ON InAs NW NUCLEATION
In this section, the impact of initial Ga incorporation on InAs SAE is studied. First, the impact of Ga content on the yield of In_{x}Ga_{1-x}As NWs is demonstrated in different tools. Its effect is further analyzed in an unintentional contamination-facilitated InAs NW SAE experiment, as well as InGaAs island growth on a bare Si (111) substrate.
A. Ga impact on NW yield
In contrast to InAs NWs, GaAs NWs can be readily obtained with nearly 100% yield on Si, with a higher growth temperature [typically 750 °C, Fig. 3(e)]. This suggests that there is a significant impact of Ga in NW SAE on Si. A series of In_{x}Ga_{1-x}As NW samples with varied Ga/In ratios were grown at 610 °C to demonstrate this effect. Growth conditions were kept the same (TMIn flow rate 16.8 μmol/min, growth time 20 min), except that the TMGa flow rate was varied. It should be noted that the TBAs flow rate is also changed accordingly to maintain a constant V/III ratio of 30. As evidenced in the tilted-view SEM pictures [Figs. 3(a)–3(d)], the yield of In_{x}Ga_{1-x}As NWs increases monotonously with the TMGa flow. To make the relationship clearer, the yield of vertical NWs versus the ratio between TMGa and the total group III flow rate is summarized in Fig. 3(f). At the TMGa/(TMGa + TMIn) ratio of 0.48 [Fig. 3(d)], nearly 100% vertical In_{x}Ga_{1-x}As NW SAE is reached. EDX mapping was conducted on these InGaAs NWs and the results are shown in Fig. 3(g). The distribution of In, Ga, As and Si elements along one single InGaAs NW [black line in Fig. 3(g)] is plotted in Fig. 3(h), which demonstrates that the composition stays stable within a 2 μm-long NW with an average x around 0.6.
It is interesting to compare the results with the In(Ga)As NW SAE where no HCl in-situ pre-cleaning was applied (tool B). The chamber and the susceptor were ex-situ cleaned before the experiment, and the identical epitaxy steps were used. As evidenced in Fig. 4(a), the vertical InAs NWs yield is also nearly zero in this case. In the InGaAs NW growth with the same growth parameters except for an additional TMGa injection, there is a significant yield improvement [Fig. 4(b)]. Nearly 100% yield is reached for GaAs NWs [Fig. 4(c)]. This trend agrees with the previous observation in tool A. However, after an intense use of the chamber for III-V epitaxy without cleaning, a high yield InAs NW SAE can be achieved [Fig. 4(d)] by the same growth recipe as used for Fig. 4(a). The high yield InAs NW SAE is maintained until the chamber is ex-situ cleaned again. The increment of the vertical NW yield with the Ga content is plotted in Fig. 4(e), where the difference in the yield with the same recipe is highlighted. In Sec. IV B, we will analyze the cause of the “abnormal” high yield InAs NW growth shown in Fig. 4(d).
B. Direct observation InAs NW SAE assisted by Ga contamination
To investigate the mechanism of the “abnormal” high yield NW growth in tool B, we focus again on the initial stage of InAs NW SAE. A baking experiment on a patterned Si sample, as done before on tool A, was conducted on tool B when the “high yield” status was reached. TOFSIMS analysis was then performed on the corresponding region as shown in Fig. 2(a). The striking observation is the presence of Ga. The mappings of Ga^{+} are shown in Fig. 2(d) (sample B), while the results from tool A (sample A) are shown in Fig. 2(c) as a comparison. The color scale bars are set in the same range. The Ga^{+} ions show much higher counts on sample B. Because the “dense” array is not fully patterned [Fig. 2(a)], the signal of Ga^{+} in the semi-dense array is the highest, corresponding to the highest active Si area density. To show the difference quantitatively, the counts of O^{–}, C^{–}, In^{+} Ga^{+} and As^{–} ions were integrated in the same region as we did on A [Fig. 2(b)]. Data from both samples are plotted together in Fig. 2(b). The count values from sample B are normalized, so that the counts of the reference O^{–} ions from both samples are the same. Among these ions, while C^{–} and As^{–} show similar normalized counts, it is clearly noticeable that the concentration of Ga^{+} and In^{+} ions in B is over one order of magnitude higher. The TOFSIMS analysis suggests that the “high yield” InAs NW SAE starts on a contaminated Si (111) surface. It should be emphasized that there was no group III material introduced on purpose throughout the experiment, and hence their presence on sample B should be related to the contamination in the MOVPE chamber after constant use.
The interface between the InAs NW and the Si substrate was examined to reveal what happens afterwards. InAs NWs were grown for 20 s at a low V/III ratio of 57 and a temperature of 520 °C. As shown in Fig. 5(a), the diameter of InAs NWs is around 30 nm, and the height is around 70 nm. The short and narrow shape facilitates the analysis of the NW/Si interface. The distribution of Ga elements was studied by EDX mapping on the cross-section of a single InAs NW [Fig. 5(b)]. The small diameter of NWs guarantees the whole NW largely within the TEM specimen thickness, and thus EDX can give a full picture of the element distribution. From the element mappings in Figs. 5(c)–5(e), it is clear that Ga concentrates at the NW/Si interface. The composition of this Ga-rich region was then analyzed by GIXRD measurement in BM25B at the ESRF with a grazing incident angle of 0.5°. The small and thin NW shape reduces the possibility of shadowing the incident X-rays by NWs and makes a better probing at the NW/Si interface. The reciprocal space mapping (RSM) in the vicinity of Si (1 0 4) in this geometry is shown in Fig. 5(f). The InAs and Si (1 0 4) diffractions together with their crystal truncation rods are present. Remarkably, an additional diffraction is observed at (0.97 0 3.86) in the scale of the Si lattice, which is related to the GaAs (1 0 4) diffraction [ideally located at (0.96 0 3.84)] with a small deviation. It indicates that GaAs-like segments form in the “InAs” NW under this growth condition. The InAs and GaAs lattices are both fully relaxed as suggested by the relaxation line (white dash). Therefore, Ga introduced at the baking step forms GaAs-like islands on the Si surface afterwards, which facilitate the high yield vertical InAs NW growth later.
C. Discussion on the role of Ga
In order to assess the role of Ga in NW nucleation, we conducted In_{x}Ga_{1-x}As growth on bare Si (111) substrates by tool A. The native oxide on the Si (111) substrate was removed by 5% BHF for 5 min. The sample was then loaded into the MOVPE chamber and baked at 900 °C in a H_{2} environment for 10 min to further remove any remaining oxide. The growth recipes were identical to those used for In_{x}Ga_{1-x}As NWs SAE (Fig. 3). The growth temperature, the TMIn flow rate and the V/III ratio were kept the same, while the TMGa flow rate was varied.
In_{x}Ga_{1-x}As follows island growth on the bare Si substrate. The typical morphology is shown in Fig. 6(a). In all samples in this series, three types of islands are observed. The first one is the hexagonal shaped island similar to the NW [Fig. 6(b)], which indicates polar-B growth. Meanwhile, tripod-shape islands are also observed [Fig. 6(c)], corresponding to the (111) A equivalent surface (polar-A growth). Besides, irregular blocks are also presented [Fig. 6(d)], which have been discussed previously and related to island coalescence and mixed polarity. Their proportions are plotted as a function of the Ga/(Ga + In) ratio in Fig. 6(e). With a higher TMGa flow rate, the percentage of irregular blocks decreases monotonously. The percentage of polar-A growth first increases with TMGa flow, while polar-B slightly decreases. Above the Ga/(Ga + In) ratio of 0.4, the percentage of the polar-A growth reduces dramatically, while polar-B growth increases to nearly 100%. It is clear that the introduction of Ga on the Si surface makes polar-B growth more favorable, and significantly suppresses the undesirable polar-A growth and the mixed polar growth. Besides, higher Ga content also enhances the nucleation capability of In_{x}Ga_{1-x}As on Si. As demonstrated by Fig. 6(f), the In_{x}Ga_{1-x}As island density increases significantly with the TMGa flow rate above a threshold.
Although the growth on an un-patterned substrate cannot be compared with NW SAE directly due to the difference in the growth kinetics, it indeed reveals two key effects of Ga in In_{x}Ga_{1-x}As growth. Firstly, Ga provides a stable polar-B type interface between the epi-layer and Si that facilitates vertical NW growth. For InAs growth on Si (111), except for (111)B polarity, (111) A can also be obtained starting from an In monolayer (Si-In (1 × 4) reconstruction) [8]. Although there is no direct result regarding the interfacial bonding information between Si (111) and the InAs epi-layer, this metastable interfacial status should contribute to the difficulties shown in direct InAs NW SAE. In contrast, for GaAs, previous works have demonstrated that the interfacial bonding is predominantly Si-As by both core-level photoemission spectroscopy and X-ray standing-wave techniques, irrespective of the growth sequence (As-first or Ga-pre-layer). The As atoms tend to occupy the upper half of the Si (111) double plane, and thus (111)B growth is always achieved naturally [structure illustrated in Fig. 1(e)] [40,41]. The initial increase in polar-A percentage could be due to the (111)A-like surface caused by In instead of Ga, though the detailed mechanism is still unclear. It could be also the reason why the inclined wires formed in the InAs NW SAE seldom appear in the GaAs NWs SAE. Second, it improves the NW yield by the increment of the nucleation possibility in the hetero-epitaxy on Si. As shown in Fig. 6(f), the In_{x}Ga_{1-x}As island density increases significantly with Ga content. The similar behavior between Figs. 6(f) and 3(f) clearly suggests a similar role of Ga in the InGaAs NW/island nucleation on Si. Besides, it has been identified in the literature that the increase in Ga can enhance the nucleation of InGaAs on Si (111) in SAE, though with a larger opening size (2 μm). This can be related to the higher affinity of GaAs for Si than InAs due to its smaller lattice mismatch with Si (4.1% vs. 11.6%) [42].
V. NOVEL GROWTH METHOD OF InAs NWs ON Si BY USING AN InGaAs NUCLEATION LAYER
Based on the previous results and discussion, an InGaAs nucleation layer on Si (111) is applied to improve the yield of vertical InAs NWs. Using the recipe corresponding to Fig. 3(d), nominal 80-nm-long In_{0.6}Ga_{0.4}As NWs were first grown [Fig. 7(a)]. InAs NW growth were hereafter initiated by switching off the TMGa flow. The temperature was kept at 610 °C for both In_{0.6}Ga_{0.4}As and InAs growth. The morphology of InAs NWs is shown in Fig. 7(b). Detailed analysis based on more SEM pictures taken at different locations throughout the wafer reveals that the yield of NWs is 99.3% at the isolated array. To confirm its composition, an XRD 2θ-ω scan was conducted at 25°–29°, and the result is shown in Fig. 7(c). Apart from the Si (111) peak located at 28.44°, there are totally three peaks. The peaks located at 25.35° and 25.45° are linked to InAs. This double peak phenomenon was analyzed in Ref [32], where we have identified that the left peak is from polytypic InAs NWs, while the right one is related to the zinc-blende structure in irregular blocks or coalesced islands. The broad weak diffraction located around 25.9° is the (111) diffraction of the nominal In_{0.6}Ga_{0.4}As nucleation layer.
The effectiveness of this approach is further demonstrated by the InAs NW SAE on the Strato mask with the opening size around 50 nm, where InAs NWs with diameter down to around 60 nm are achieved [Fig. 7(d)]. This suggests that this method is capable of further NW dimension scaling. The vertical NW yield slightly decreases to around 95%, which could be related to the change in the growth kinetics due to the difference in the pattern geometry. There is still room for further improvement by tuning the growth parameter of the InGaAs nucleation layer, which was optimized in the template with larger dimensions.
VI. SUMMARY
In this work, the difficulty of direct InAs NW SAE on a clean Si (111) surface is presented, which is attributed to the instable polarity of the Si surface at the beginning of InAs NW growth. The effect of Ga is then analyzed in both NW SAE and island growth on bare Si. It is found that the increase in Ga content in In_{x}Ga_{1-x}As is essential to stabilize the vertical polar-B growth and enhance the nucleation process. The unintentional Ga incorporation at the Si surface improves the yield of InAs NWs in SAE dramatically due to the formation of the GaAs-like seeding layer. We finally propose a method using an InGaAs nucleation layer for InAs NW SAE on Si, and nearly 100% yield is obtained. This work was done on full 300 mm wafers by a production tool and thus provides a promising way for the large scale fabrication of III-V vertical gate-all-around field effect transistors.

Tool B was in the condition when high yield InAs NWs can be grown. The count values in sample B are normalized, so that the values of the reference O^{−} ion from both samples are the same. (c) and (d) TOFSIMS mapping of Ga^{+} ions on samples A and B, respectively. The unit of the color scale bar is counts.
FIG. 3. 
Tilted-view (45°) SEM images of (a)–(d) In_{x}Ga_{1-x}As NWs SAE under TMGa/(TMIn + TMGa) ratio of 0, 0.38, 0.44 and 0.48, respectively; and (e) top-view SEM image of GaAs NWs. A tilted-view SEM picture is shown in the inset. All samples are grown by tool A. InAs and In_{x}Ga_{1-x}As NWs were grown at 610 °C, TMIn flow rate, V/III ratio and other growth conditions were kept the same. GaAs NWs were grown at a higher temperature (750 °C). (f) The yield of vertical NWs versus the TMGa/(TMIn + TMGa) ratio. (g) EDX mapping of InGaAs NWs from (d). (h) The composition distribution in a single InGaAs NW along the black line shown in (g).
FIG. 4. 
Top-view SEM images of NWs grown on tool B: (a) InAs NWs, (b) InGaAs NWs and (c) GaAs NWs. The arrow indicates the increasing TMGa flow rate used in these growths. (d) Tilted-view SEM image of the InAs NWs grown after an intense use of the chamber for III-V materials epitaxy, using the same recipe as (a). (e) The yield of vertical NWs as a function of TMGa/(TMGa + TMIn) flow ratio. The red dot depicts the InAs NWs shown in (a), while the green triangle represents that in (d). Results from Fig. 3(f) are also included (light grey) for an easier comparison.
FIG. 5. 
(a) 45° tilted SEM picture of InAs NWs for element distribution analysis. (b) HAADF TEM image of a single NW. (c)–(e) EDX mapping of In, Ga, and As elements in this single wire, the scale bars are 10 nm. The background Ga is introduced in FIB sample preparation. (f) GIXRD reciprocal space mapping in the vicinity of Si (1 0 4). The mapping is plotted in the reciprocal lattice units (r. l. u.) of the Si lattice. Si (1 0 4) and InAs (1 0 4) reflections are denoted. Besides these two, an additional diffraction peak located around (0.96 0 3.84) is identified as GaAs (1 0 4). The intensity of Si (1 0 4) diffraction is beyond the limit of the detector. All components lie on the relaxation line (white dash).

In_{x}Ga_{1-x}As growth experiment on the bare Si (111) substrate. (a) Typical morphology of InGaAs growth on Si. (b)–(d) Characteristic shape of (b) polar-B structure, (c) polar-A structure and (d) irregular blocks. Tilted view SEM image of a polar-A structure, with the tripod shape following three ⟨11¯1¯⟩ directions visible, is shown in the inset of (c). All scale bars are 2 μm. (e) The percentage of polar-B (black), polar-A (red) and irregular (blue) structures as a function of nominal Ga content (the ratio between TMGa and the total group III flow rate). (f) The InGaAs island density plotted versus the nominal Ga content.
FIG. 7. 
(a) 45° tilted-view SEM image of the nominal 80-nm-long In_{0.6}Ga_{0.4}As NWs for nucleation, (b) InAs NWs grown using the In_{0.6}Ga_{0.4}As nucleation layer, the inset shows a high-resolution SEM image. (c) HR-XRD 2θ-ω scan of this sample, the Si (111) peak at 2θ = 28.44°, the zinc-blende InAs (111) peak at 2θ = 25.45°, the InAs NW peak at 2θ = 25.35° and a broad InGaAs peak around 2θ = 25.9° are identified (for a detailed discussion about the InAs double peak phenomenon, see Ref [32]). (d) Tilted view SEM pictures of InAs NWs grown in arrays with opening size around 50 nm. The diameter of NWs (∼60 nm) largely follows the opening size.
