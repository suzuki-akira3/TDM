Representations of the multi-qubit Clifford group
The q-qubit Clifford group, that is, the normalizer of the q-qubit Pauli group in U(2^{q}), is a fundamental structure in quantum information with a wide variety of applications. We characterize all irreducible subrepresentations of the two-copy representation φ^{⊗2} of the Clifford group on the two-fold tensor product of the space of linear operators M2^{q}⊗2. In the companion paper [Helsen et_al, e-print arXiv:1701.04299 (2017)], we apply this result to improve the statistics of randomized benchmarking, a method for characterizing quantum systems.
I. INTRODUCTION
Symmetric structures, encoded as groups, play a fundamental role in the study of quantum information theory and quantum mechanics in general. The Pauli group and its normalizer, the Clifford group, are particularly important in quantum information, with applications such as quantum error-correcting codes [1], quantum tomographic methods [2], and quantum data hiding [3]. Furthermore, operations within the Clifford group can be efficiently simulated [4] and the Clifford group is a unitary 2-design [3], that is, averages over the standard representation of the Clifford group reproduce the first two moments of the Haar average over the full unitary group [5]. These properties make the Clifford group useful for characterization protocols for quantum systems such as randomized benchmarking [6].
A subgroup of the unitary group (in our case the Clifford group) is a unitary t-design if the irreducible subrepresentations of t tensor copies of its standard representation are in one-to-one correspondence with the irreducible subrepresentations of the same construction involving the full unitary group [7]. This equivalent definition is useful because the tensor representations of the unitary group are well understood via Schur-Weyl duality [8].
Recently it has been shown that the q-qubit Clifford group is also a unitary 3-design [9,10]. However, simultaneously it was shown that the multi-qubit Clifford group is not a unitary 4-design. Consequently, the representation of 4 tensor copies of the standard representation of the Clifford group differs from the same construction using the unitary group. In this paper, we will analyze a closely related representation of the Clifford group which we call the two-copy representation. This representation is the tensor product of two tensor copies of the standard representation and two tensor copies of the dual of the standard representation. The structure of the two-copy representation of the single-qubit Clifford group was analyzed in Ref [11] and used to analyze the statistical performance of randomized benchmarking.
In this paper, we provide a complete analysis of the two-copy representation of the multi-qubit Clifford group for any number of qubits. In the companion paper [12], we use these results to analyze multi-qubit randomized benchmarking, leading to a substantial reduction in the amount of data required to obtain rigorous and precise estimates using the randomized benchmarking procedure.
II. PRELIMINARIES
We begin by setting some relevant notation. We denote by M_{d} the vector space of linear operators from C^{d} to C^{d}. We will only be interested in the case d = 2^{q}, where q∈N is the number of qubits in the system. Other finite dimensional vector spaces will often be denoted by V, with |V| being the dimension of that vector space. We also recall that the vector space M_{d} can be equipped with the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product which takes the form
We also denote the (anti-) commutator of two elements of M_{d} as
To facilitate later analysis, we also recall some standard facts about representation and character theory. We will mostly follow Ref [13]. Readers familiar with representation theory may skip this part.
A. Representation theory
Let GL(V) be the general linear group over a finite dimensional (real or complex) vector space V, i.e., the group of invertible linear transformations of V. Let G be a finite group. A representation φ_{V} of G on a finite dimensional (real or complex) vector space V is a map
with the property
We call V the space carrying the representation φ_{V}. A subspace W ⊂ V carries a subrepresentation of φ_{V} (denoted as φ_{W}) if
for all g ∈ G. A representation φ_{V} is called irreducible if there is no non-trivial (W ≠ 0) proper subspace W of V such that φ_{V}(g)W ⊂ W for all g ∈ G. Two representations φ_{V} and φ_{V′} are called equivalent, denoted as φ ≅ φ′, if and only if there exists an invertible linear map T: V′ → V such that
A central result for irreducible representations is Schur’s lemma [13]. Let φ_{V}, φ_{V′} be irreducible representations of a finite group G on spaces V, V′. Then Schur’s lemma states that a linear map A: V → V′ satisfies
if and only if A is of the form
for some λ∈C. We note an important corollary. Let φ_{V} = ⊕_{i}φ_{i} be a representation of a group G composed of irreducible inequivalent representations φ_{i} and let A: V → V satisfy φ(g)A = Aφ(g) for all g ∈ G. Then we must have
for some λ_{i}∈C, where the P_{i} are projectors onto the subspaces of V carrying the irreducible subrepresentations φ_{i}.
We next recall the character of a representation. Let φ: G → V be a representation of a finite group G on a finite dimensional (real or complex) vector space V. The character χ_{φ}:G→C of the representation φ is defined as
where Tr_{V}( ) denotes the trace over the vector space V. Characters have a number of useful properties [13] which we recall here. For representations φ, φ′, we have the relations
with suitable generalizations to multiple direct sums and tensor products. The inner product between the characters of two representations φ and φ′ of a finite group G is
where * denotes complex conjugation. Schur’s orthogonality relations state that for irreducible representations φ, φ′ of G,
We note the following useful corollary. Let φ=⊕_{i}φi⊕n_{i}, where the φ_{i} are all irreducible, inequivalent representations and n_{i} denotes the multiplicity of φ_{i} in φ. Then Eq. (13) implies
In particular, we also have
with equality if and only if φ is irreducible.
B. The Pauli and Clifford groups
Finally we recall definitions for the Pauli and Clifford groups, note some useful facts about the Pauli group, and define what we mean by the “two-copy representation” of the Clifford group.
Definition 1 (Multi-qubit Pauli and Clifford groups). Take U(d) to be the group of d × d unitary matrices (where d = 2^{q}), which has a standard representation [^{13}]on the complex vector spaceC^{d}. For q = 1, let {v_{0}, v_{1}} be an orthonormal basis ofC^{2}and in this basis define the following linear operators by their action on the basis
for l ∈ {0, 1} and addition over indices is taken modulo 2. Note that X, Y, Z ∈ U(2). The q-qubit Pauli groupP_{q}is now defined as the subgroup of the unitary group U(2^{q}) consisting of all q-fold tensor products of q elements ofP_{1}≔⟨X,Z,i1_{2}⟩. The q-qubit Clifford groupC_{q}is the normalizer (up to complex phases) ofP_{q}in U(2^{q}), that is,
Both the Clifford and Pauli groups have a standard faithful representation on the vector spaceC^{d}with d = 2^{q}as they are subgroups of the unitary group U(d). We also defineP^{q}as the subset ofP_{q}consisting of all q-fold tensor products of the operators{1,X,Y,Z}. Note that all the elements ofP^{q}are Hermitian.For a more expansive introduction to the Pauli and Clifford groups, see, e.g., Ref [14] and references therein.Next we recall some useful facts about the Pauli group and its standard representation. We begin by noting that the Hermitian subset P^{q} of the Pauli group forms an orthogonal basis for the Hilbert space M_{d}. We can turn this into an orthonormal basis [under the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product in Eq. (1)] by introducing normalized Pauli matrices
where we have given the normalized identity its own symbol for later convenience. We also define σ^{q}≔σ_{q}∪{σ_{0}}. We will denote the elements of the set σ_{q} by Greek letters (σ, τ, ν, …). For the case of a single qubit, we denote the normalized X, Y, Z Pauli matrices by σ_{X}, σ_{Y}, σ_{Z}, respectively. We also, for later convenience, introduce the normalized matrix product of two normalized Pauli matrices as
Note that σ⋅τ∈±σ^{q} if [σ, τ] = 0 and iσ · τ ∈ ±σ_{q} if {σ, τ} = 0. Finally, we define the following parametrized subsets of σ_{q} and σ^{q}. For all τ ∈ σ_{q}, we define
Note that we have |Ĉ_{τ}|=|N_{τ}|=d^{2}2 and Ĉ_{τ} and N_{τ} are disjoint for all τ ∈ σ_{q}. With regard to these sets we also state the following lemma, which we prove in Appendix A:
Lemma 1. Let τ, τ′ ∈ σ_{q}and τ ≠ τ′. The following equalities hold
Also for all τ ∈ σ_{q}, we have
As mentioned above, σ^{q} forms an orthonormal basis for M_{d}. We can define a representation φ of the Clifford group by its action by conjugation on this basis, we have
where C is the standard representation of the Clifford group on C^{d} discussed before. We call φ the one-copy representation. Note that this representation is equivalent to the representation C ⊗ C^{*}, where * denotes the complex conjugate [13]. It is a standard result [11] that this representation decomposes into two irreducible subrepresentations carried by the spaces
The representation carried by the space V_{adj} is called the adjoint representation.Note that we have for all C∈C_{q} and σ∈σ^{q} that φ(C)σ = ±τ for some τ∈σ^{q}. This means that in the basis σ^{q} the Clifford group is represented by signed permutation matrices. Note also that the action of the Clifford group through φ is transitive on σ_{q} [14].Now we define analogously the two-copy representation of the q-qubit Clifford group C_{q} on the Hilbert space M_{d}⊗M_{d}=Md⊗2 (hence the name two-copy representation). We define φ^{⊗2} with respect to its action on the basis
of Md⊗2. We define the action of φ^{⊗2} on B as
Note that this representation is equivalent to the representation C ⊗ C^{*} ⊗ C ⊗ C^{*}. For brevity, we will often forget about the tensor product symbol and write σ ⊗ τ as στ when it is clear from the context. Note that in the basis B the action of a Clifford element C∈C_{q} again takes the form of a signed permutation matrix. The rest of the paper will be concerned with identifying the irreducible subrepresentations of φ^{⊗2}.
III. THE TWO-COPY REPRESENTATION OF THE MULTI-QUBIT CLIFFORD GROUP
The characterization for multiple qubits is more complicated than the single-qubit case considered previously [11] because non-trivial elements of the multi-qubit Pauli group can commute, while others can anti-commute and these relations must be preserved under the action of the Clifford group [14]. This section will be composed of several lemmas, ultimately culminating in Theorem 1. In these lemmas, we will introduce a variety of subspaces of Md⊗2 and prove that they all carry subrepresentations of φ^{⊗2}. In Theorem 1, we will then exactly characterize which of the subspaces carry irreducible subrepresentations. We begin by calculating how many subrepresentations we require for each q. The following lemma, proven in Ref [9], characterizes the inner product with itself of the character χ_{φ^{⊗2}} of the two-copy representation of the Clifford group [20].
Lemma 2. LetC_{q}be the q-qubit Clifford group and φ^{⊗2}be its two-copy representation with characterχ_{φ^{⊗2}}. The character inner product of this representation with itself is
By Eq. (14), this number provides an upper limit to how many (in)equivalent irreducible subrepresentations the representation φ^{⊗2} can contain. We will now, over the course of several lemmas (Lemmas 4–6, 8, and 9), divide the space Md⊗2 into subspaces carrying subrepresentations of φ^{⊗2}. This will eventually culminate in Theorem 1 where we prove that all the subrepresentations derived in Lemmas 4–6, 8, and 9 are in fact irreducible.We continue by defining subspaces of the space Md⊗2 (spanned by B) that carry subrepresentations of C_{q}. Not all of these spaces will carry irreducible representations, these will be divided further in Lemmas 4–6, 8, and 9.
Definition 2. LetBbe the basis forMd⊗2as in Eq. (26) and define the vectors
for σ, τ ∈ σ_{q}and σ ≠ τ. We define the following subspaces ofMd⊗2:
These spaces do not all carry irreducible subrepresentations of φ^{⊗2} but they do all carry subrepresentations. This is proven in the following lemma.
Lemma 3. All spaces W defined in Definition 2 carry a subrepresentation of the representation φ^{⊗2}of the Clifford groupC_{q}, that is,
Note that W may be empty for q = 1, in which case the statement holds trivially.
Proof. First note that Cσ_{0}C^{†} = σ_{0} for all C∈C_{q} and that for any C∈C_{q} and σ ∈ σ_{q}, there exists a τ ∈ σ_{q} such that CσC^{†} = ±τ. This means the spaces V_{id}, V_{r}, V_{l}, and V_{d} carry a subrepresentation of φ^{⊗2}. Note also that we have
for all σ, τ ∈ σ_{q} and σ ≠ τ and also
for all σ,τ∈σ^{q}. From these equations, it is easy to see that V_{[S]}, V_{{S}}, V_{[A]}, and V_{{A}} carry subrepresentations of φ^{⊗2} as well.Note that since V_{id} is a trivial representation it is automatically irreducible. Over the next few lemmas, we will further characterize the other spaces defined in Definition 2, beginning with the diagonal sector, i.e., the space V_{d}.
Lemma 4 (Diagonal sector). Take the space V_{d}as defined in Definition 2 and define the following 3 subspaces:
with|V_{1}|=d(d+1)2−1and|V_{2}|=d(d−1)2−1. We have the following statements:
• For q = 1, the spaces V_{0}and V_{1}carry irreducible subrepresentations of φ^{⊗2}and V_{2} = 0.
• For q ≥ 2, the spaces V_{0}, V_{1}, and V_{2}carry irreducible subrepresentations of φ^{⊗2}.
Proof. The special case of q = 1 was treated in Ref [11]. We will treat the case q ≥ 2. We begin by establishing that the space V_{d} = span{σσ ∥ σ ∈ σ_{q}} has exactly three subspaces carrying inequivalent subrepresentations of φ^{⊗2}. One can see this by considering the character χ_{d} of φ^{⊗2} restricted to V_{d}. It is easy to see by direct calculation that for all C∈C_{q} we have χ_{d}(C) = F(C), where F(C) is the number of non-identity Pauli matrices fixed under conjugation by C up to a sign. This means that the character inner product ⟨χ_{d}, χ_{d}⟩ is given by
By a generalized version of Burnside’s Lemma (see Ref [9]), we can relate this to the number of orbits of the Clifford group (up to signs) on the set σ_{q} × σ_{q}. These orbits were characterized in Ref [9] which yielded ⟨χ_{d}, χ_{d}⟩ = 3 for q ≥ 2. This means, by Eq. (14), that V_{d} must contain exactly three inequivalent irreducible subrepresentations (all with multiplicity one). It is easy to see that V_{0} carries a trivial subrepresentation by noting that φ^{⊗2} acts as a permutation on the basis of V_{d}. Hence we can write V_{d} = V_{0} ⊕ V_{orth}, where
Because of the character argument given above, we know that this space must decompose into exactly two orthogonal subspaces V_{1}, V_{2} which carry irreducible inequivalent subrepresentations of φ^{⊗2}. We now characterize these subrepresentations. We define the linear map T:V_{d}→V_{d} by its action on the basis of V_{d}. For all τ ∈ σ_{q}, we have
It is easy to see that this map commutes with the action of φ^{⊗2} on V_{d}. Hence, by the character argument above and Schur’s lemma [Eq. (8)], it must be of the form
where P_{0} is the projector onto the space V_{0} and P_{1}, P_{2} are projectors onto the eigenspaces of T with eigenvalues a_{1}, a_{2}, respectively. We will label these eigenspaces V_{1} and V_{2}. Note that a_{1},a_{2}∈R since T is symmetric. We will also assume that a_{1} ≤ a_{2}. This can always be achieved by relabeling. By inspection, we see that a_{0}=d^{2}2. We can find a_{1}, a_{2} by considering the squared operator T^{2}. We can compute its matrix elements in the given basis of V_{d} as
where the last equality follows from Lemma 1 and |N_{τ}|=d^{2}2 for all τ ∈ σ_{q}. From this characterization, we can find the action of T^{2} on v ∈ V_{orth}
where we used the definition of v ∈ V_{orth}. This means that we must have a12=a22=d^{2}4. There are hence two options: either a_{1} = a_{2} or a_{1} = −a_{2}. We can exclude the first option by noting that the operator T is traceless. Hence we must have
where |V_{i}| is the dimension of the space V_{i}. By noting that |V_{1}| + |V_{2}| = d^{2} − 2 and that V_{1}, V_{2} ≠ 0 (this is a consequence of the character argument above), we find the only possible solution to be
We can now diagonalize the operator T to find the description for the spaces V_{1}, V_{2} given in the lemma statement.Next we establish an equivalence between the representations carried by V_{r} and V_{l} and two subspaces in the symmetric and antisymmetric sectors. All four of these spaces will be equivalent to the adjoint representation of the Clifford group, already mentioned in Eq. (25).
Lemma 5 (Adjoint representations). Take the vector spaces V_{r}, V_{l}as defined in Definition 2. Also define the vector spaces
located in the symmetric commuting and antisymmetric anti-commuting sectors. The spaces V_{r}, V_{l}, V_{{adj}}, and V_{[adj]}carry equivalent irreducible representations.
Proof. Note that the representations carried by the spaces V_{r}, V_{l} are trivially equivalent to the adjoint representation [Eq. (25)] of the Clifford group, which is irreducible [3]. This leaves us with the spaces V_{{adj}} and V_{[adj]}. We begin by noting that the spaces V_{[adj]}, V_{{adj}} carry subrepresentations. This is easily seen by taking vτ[adj]∈V_{[adj]} as defined in the lemma statement and writing
where we used the fact that the action of the Clifford group preserves commutativity of elements of the Pauli group and acts transitively on σ_{q}. We have a similar argument for V_{{adj}}. Note also that the vectors spanning V_{[adj]} as given in the lemma statement form an orthonormal basis for V_{[adj]}. For τ, τ′ ∈ σ_{q}, we have
where we obtained the second to the last equality by using Lemma 1 and noting that ⟨σ · σ_{0}, τ⟩ = 0 if σ ∈ C_{τ}. We can make a similar argument for the vectors spanning V_{{adj}}. Now since |V_{r}| = |V_{[adj]}|, we can construct the isomorphism
We can check that this isomorphism commutes with the action of φ^{⊗2}. We have for all τ ∈ σ_{q}
for all C∈C_{q}. This means that the spaces V_{r} and V_{[adj]} carry equivalent subrepresentations of φ^{⊗2}. We can make the same argument for V_{{adj}} and hence V_{[adj]}, V_{{adj}}, V_{r}, V_{l} carry equivalent irreducible representations.Now we turn our attention to the antisymmetric sector, i.e., the spaces V_{[A]}, V_{{A}} as defined in Definition 2, where we can formulate the following lemma.
Lemma 6 (Antisymmetric sector). Take the space V_{{A}}as defined in Definition 2 and note that it contains the space V_{{adj}} (defined in Lemma 5). Denote the orthogonal complement of V_{{adj}}in V_{{A}}asV{adj}⊥. We have that the subrepresentations of φ^{⊗2}carried by V_{[A]}andV{adj}⊥are equivalent.
Proof. Note that V{adj}⊥ carries a subrepresentation of φ^{⊗2} by Maschke’s lemma [13] since V_{{adj}} and V_{{A}} carry subrepresentations. We will prove that the representations carried by V{adj}⊥ and V_{[A]} are equivalent by constructing an isomorphism between them that commutes with the action of φ^{⊗2}. Note first that we can write down the following orthogonal basis for V_{[A]} as
Now consider the following linear map (defined as the linear extension of its action on the basis defined above) between V_{[A]} and V_{{A}}.
for all σ ∈ C_{τ}, τ ∈ σ_{q}. We now argue that the image of Θ is orthogonal to the space V_{{adj}}. We do this by direct calculation. For all ν ∈ σ_{q} and all σ ∈ C_{τ}, τ ∈ σ_{q} we can calculate
where in the last line we used Lemma 1 and |N_{τ} ∩ C_{σ}| = |N_{τ} ∩ Ĉ_{σ}| if σ ∈ C_{τ}. This means that (Θ)⊂V{adj}⊥. We now argue that (Θ)=V{adj}⊥. We first note that |V{adj}⊥|=|V_{[A]}|. Furthermore we can show that Θ preserves orthogonality under the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product and that Ker(Θ) = 0. By direct calculation, we have for all τ, τ′ ∈ σ_{q} and σ ∈ C_{τ}, σ′ ∈ C_{τ′}
To further evaluate this expression, we use the following fact. Let ν∈σ^{q} such that σ · σ′ ∝ ν (note that this implies that ν ∈ Ĉ_{τ}). We then have
We use this together with the fact that C_{τ} ∩ N_{τ} = ∅ for all τ ∈ σ_{q} to reduce Eq. (76) to
where in the last equality we used Lemma 1 together with σ · σ′ ∝ ν and that N_{τ} ∩ Ĉ_{ν} = N_{τ} ∩ C_{ν} if ν ∈ C_{τ} and that C_{ν} = σ_{q} if ν = σ_{0} which occurs if and only if σ = σ′. Since ⟨A_{σ,iσ⋅τ}, A_{σ′,σ′⋅τ′}⟩ = δ_{τ,τ′}(δ_{σ,σ′} + δ_{σ,iσ′⋅τ}) this means that Θ preserves orthogonality and that Ker(Θ) = 0. Together with the fact that |V{adj}⊥|=|V_{[A]}| this implies that (Θ)=V{adj}⊥. This means we can restrict Θ to an isomorphism from V_{[A]} to V{adj}⊥. We will abuse notation and refer to this isomorphism as Θ as well.To prove that the representations carried by V_{[A]} and V{adj}⊥ are equivalent, we now still have to argue that Θ commutes with φ^{⊗2}. We can do this by direct calculation. For all τ ∈ σ_{q} and σ ∈ C_{τ} and C∈C_{q}, we have
This proves the equivalence of the subrepresentations carried by V_{[A]} and V{adj}⊥.Note that we have not proven that the subrepresentations carried by V_{[A]} and V{adj}⊥ are irreducible. We will get this irreducibility for free when proving Theorem 1.Next up are the symmetric sectors. In order to facilitate the analysis of these spaces, we begin by proving the following technical lemma. This technical lemma allows us to draw conclusions about the subrepresentations of φ^{⊗2} carried by subspaces of V_{[S]} and V_{{S}} by considering the action of a strict subgroup of the Clifford group C_{q} on particular subspaces of V_{[S]} and V_{{S}}.
Lemma 7 (space reduction). For every τ ∈ σ_{q}, define a subgroupCqτofC_{q}as
Also define subspace V =span{σσ^‖σ,σ^∈σ_{q},σ≠σ^}⊂Md⊗2and for all τ ∈ σ_{q}, define the subspace
The first claim of the lemma is
• The space V decomposes with respect to V^{τ}, that is,
Now assume that for some τ ∈ σ_{q}there exists a subspace W^{τ}of V^{τ}such that
The second claim of the lemma is
• For all τ′ ∈ σ_{q}, there exist W^{τ′} ⊂ V^{τ′}such that W^{τ}and W^{τ′}are isomorphic and that
with
Proof. Note first that ∪_{τ^{′}∈σq}V^{τ′}=V and also for τ, τ′ ∈ σ_{q} we have for all σ_{τ}σ^{τ}∈V^{τ}, σ_{τ^{′}}σ^{τ^{′}}∈V^{τ′} that
since if σ_{τ} = σ_{τ′} we must have (σ^{τ}=σ^{τ^{′}}⇔τ=τ^{′}). This immediately implies
This proves the first claim of the lemma.Now assume that there exists a τ ∈ σ_{q} such that there is a subspace W^{τ} ⊂ V^{τ} such that for all Ĉ∈Cqτ we have φ^{⊗2}(Ĉ)W^{τ} ⊂ W^{τ}. For all τ′ ∈ σ_{q}, we can define the following subset S_{τ′} of C_{q}:
Because the C_{q} acts transitively on σ_{q} this set is never empty. Now for every C ∈ S_{τ′}, we can define the subspace W^{C} as
Note that for every C ∈ S_{τ′} we have W^{C,τ′} ⊂ V^{τ′}. We also have for C_{1}, C_{2} ∈ S_{τ′} that
The first equation implies that
which we can left-multiply by φ^{⊗2}(C_{1}) to get
We can repeat this reasoning with C_{2}, C_{1} interchanged to obtain W^{C2,τ′}⊂W^{C1,τ′} and thus
for all τ′. Let us label this single subspace by W^{τ′}. Note that since W^{τ} ⊂ V^{τ} for all τ ∈ σ_{q} the spaces W^{τ}, W^{τ′} are orthogonal for τ ≠ τ′. Hence we can consider the space
Now take w ∈ W. We can write
Now for all C ∈ C_{q} and τ ∈ σ_{q}, there exist unique vectors u^{τ′} ∈ V^{τ′} with τ′ = ±CτC^{†} such that
which proves the lemma.Next we turn our attention to the symmetric commuting sector, i.e., the space V_{[S]}. We will decompose this space by using a curious connection between the representation φ^{⊗2} of C_{q} on V_{[S]} and the representation φ^{⊗2} of C_{q−1} (the Clifford group on q − 1 qubits) on its diagonal sector Vdq−1. We have the following lemma.
Lemma 8 (Symmetric commuting sector). Take the space V_{[S]}as defined in Definition 2, the space V_{[adj]}as defined in Lemma 5 and define the spaces
where for all τ ∈ σ_{q}
Note that V_{[1]}, V_{[2]}, and V_{[adj]}are subspaces of V_{[S]}. We have the following:
• For q = 1, we have V_{[S]} = 0 and hence V_{[1]} = V_{[2]} = V_{[adj]} = 0.
• For q = 2, we have V_{[S]} = V_{[adj]} ⊕ V_{[1]}and V_{[2]} = 0. The spaces V_{[adj]}and V_{[1]}carry irreducible subrepresentations of φ^{⊗2}.
• For q ≥ 3 have V_{[S]} = V_{[adj]} ⊕ V_{[1]} ⊕ V_{[2]}. The spaces V_{[adj]}, V_{[1]}and V_{[2]}carry irreducible subrepresentations of φ^{⊗2}.
Proof. We begin the proof by noting that the statement is trivial for q = 1. For q ≥ 2, we see that the space V_{[S]} can be block decomposed in the following way:
with
Using Lemma 7 we can, to find subspaces of V_{[S]} carrying subrepresentations of φ^{⊗2}, restrict ourselves to finding, for some τ ∈ σ_{q}, subspaces of V[S]τ that are invariant under the representation φ^{⊗2} restricted the subgroup Cqτ⊂C_{q}, where Cqτ is defined as in Lemma 7. For the purposes of this proof, we choose τ = σ_{Z}σ_{0}, where σ_{Z} is the single qubit normalized Pauli element Z/2. This means that we can write any σ^∈C_{τ} as
with σ_{q−1} being the normalized, hermitian, non-identity Pauli elements on q − 1 qubits. We also recall the definition of the diagonal sector on q − 1 qubits
Since we have that
for all σ ∈ σ_{q−1}, there is an isomorphism θ between the vector spaces Vdq−1 and V[S]τ of the form
Now consider the Clifford group on q − 1 qubits, C_{q−1}. It can be seen as a subgroup of the group Cqτ through the embedding
Now note that Cqτ preserves the commutation relations of the set σ_{q−1}, that is, for all σ,σ^∈σ_{q−1} and σ_{1},σ^{1}∈{σ_{0},σ_{Z}}, we have
for all C∈Cqτ with the same conclusion holding for the anti-commutator. Now from this and Eq. (111), one can see that for all C∈Cqτ there exists a Ĉ∈C_{q−1} such that φ^{⊗2}(C)v=φ^{⊗2}(θ^(Ĉ))v for all v∈V[S]τ. This means that for any subspace W of V[S]τ we have
Now let us consider the representation φ^{⊗2} of C_{q−1} on q − 1 qubits. Let us label the restriction of this representation to Vdq−1 as φ_{d}. From Lemma 4, we see that Vdq−1 for q − 1 = 1 decomposes into two spaces carrying irreducible subrepresentations of φ_{d} and for q − 1 ≥ 2 decomposes into three spaces. We shall label these V0q−1,V1q−1, and V2q−1 with the tacit understanding that V2q−1=0 for q − 1 = 1. Now note that we have for all Ĉ∈C_{q−1} and all σ ∈ σ_{q−1} that
which implies that the representations φ_{d} and the subrepresentation of φ^{⊗2} carried by V[S]τ restricted to the image of θ^ are equivalent with the equivalence given by the map θ. This means that the subspace V[S]τ (with τ = σ_{Z}σ_{0}) decomposes into three subspaces carrying irreducible subrepresentations of φ^{⊗2} restricted to Cqτ. We label these three spaces as
with τ = σ_{Z}σ_{0}. From Lemma 7 and identifying the spaces ⊕_{τ^{′}∈σq}V[0]τ^{′} and V_{[adj]}, we now arrive at the lemma statement.Finally we analyze the symmetric anti-commuting sector, i.e., the space V_{{S}}. This space carries an irreducible subrepresentation for q = 1 and falls apart into two subspaces carrying irreducible subrepresentations for q ≥ 2. We have the following lemma.
Lemma 9 (Symmetric anti-commuting sector). Take the space V_{{S}}as defined in Definition 2 and define the subspaces
where for all τ ∈ σ_{q}:
We have the following statements:
• For q = 1, the space V_{{S}}carries an irreducible subrepresentation of φ^{⊗2}.
• For q ≥ 2, we have V_{{S}} = V_{{1}} ⊕ V_{{2}}and the spaces V_{{1}}and V_{{2}}carry subrepresentations of φ^{⊗2}.
Proof. The q = 1 case was dealt with in Ref [11], we will deal with the case of q ≥ 2. The argument goes by a combination of the arguments in Lemmas 4 and 8. First note that we can write V_{{S}} as
We can again use Lemma 7 to look for subspaces of V_{{S}} carrying subrepresentations of φ^{⊗2} by considering the action of the strict subgroup Cqτ of C_{q} on the space V{S}τ (where Cqτ is defined as in Lemma 7). As in Lemma 8, we choose τ = σ_{Z}σ_{0}. The elements of σ_{q} that anti-commute with τ can now be seen to be
where σ_{X}, σ_{Y}, σ_{Z} are again the normalized single qubit Pauli operators X/2,Y/2,Z/2. Note that the set N_{τ} leads to an ambiguous definition of a basis for V{S}τ as we have that
for all σ∈σ^{q−1} (recall that σ^{q−1}=σ_{q−1}∪{σ_{0}}). We resolve this ambiguity by choosing the set {σ_{X}σ|σ∈σ^{q−1}} to generate a basis of V{S}τ. This makes that
In the spirit of Lemma 4, we define the following linear map A as a linear extension of the action on the basis of V{S}τ as
We can argue that this map commutes with the action of φ^{⊗2} restricted to Cqτ (where Cqτ is defined as in Lemma 7 with τ = σ_{Z}σ_{0}) by direct calculation. We have for C∈Cqτ and σ∈σ^{q−1}
This means that, through Schur’s lemma the map A tells us something about the subrepresentations of φ^{⊗2} restricted to Cqτ carried by V{S}τ. Because τ = σ_{Z}σ_{0}, we can write A in a slightly better form by noting
where we recall Ĉ_{σ} to be Ĉ_{σ} = C_{σ} ∪ {σ_{0}, σ}. We now analyze the properties of the map A by calculating Tr(A) and A^{2}. We have
We can calculate A^{2} entry-wise. We abuse notation a little bit by denoting the entries of A^{2} as [A^{2}]{σ,σ^} with σ,σ^∈σ^{q−1} [this set has a one-to-one correspondence with the basis of V_{{S}} in Eq. (123)]. We calculate
where the last equality follows directly from Lemma 1. We see that A^{2} is proportional to the identity. This means that the eigenvalues of A must be ±d. Since A is not proportional to the identity, this means that both eigenvalues must be associated with non-trivial eigenspaces. Schur’s lemma thus implies that V{S}τ carries a reducible subrepresentation of φ^{⊗2} restricted to Cqτ and moreover that the eigenspaces of A must be subrepresentations. We will call the spaces carrying these subrepresentations V{1}τ and V{2}τ, where we identify V{1}τ with the d eigenvalue of A and V{2}τ with the −d eigenvalue of A. We can find out the dimensions of these spaces by noting that
Solving these equations yields
Diagonalizing A then yields the equations given in the lemma statement for V{1}τ and V{2}τ and by Lemma 7 we also get that V_{{1}} and V_{{2}} as defined in the lemma statement carry subrepresentations of the subrepresentation carried by V_{{S}}.Note that we have not argued that the spaces V_{{1}}, V_{{2}} carry irreducible subrepresentations. We will get the irreducibility for free in the full decomposition theorem, which we will deal with now. Using Lemmas 4–6, 8 and 9, we can prove the main result of this paper: a decomposition of the two-copy representation φ^{⊗2} of the Clifford group C_{q} valid for any number of qubits q. We have
Theorem 1 (Decomposition of the two-copy representation). The decomposition of the vector spaceMd⊗2=span{B}into subspaces carrying irreducible subrepresentations ofC_{q}in φ^{⊗2}for different values of q is
where all spaces are as defined in Definition 2 and Lemmas 4–6, 8, and 9 and are gathered in Table I in Appendix B.
Proof. The q = 1 case is dealt with in Ref [11]. We will now deal with the cases q = 2 and q ≥ 3. Beginning with q ≥ 3 note that we have already argued (in Lemmas 4–6, 8, and 9) that all spaces given in Theorem 1 are non-trivial and carry subrepresentations of φ^{⊗2}. It remains to argue that these subrepresentations are all irreducible. We will do this using the Schur orthogonality relations [Eq. (14)] and Lemma 2. Begin by noting that the representations carried by the spaces V_{r}, V_{l}, V_{[adj]}, and V_{{adj}} are equivalent (Lemma 5), the representations carried by the spaces V_{[A]} and V{adj}⊥ are equivalent (Lemma 6) and the representations carried by V_{id} and V_{0} are equivalent (Because they are both the trivial representation). Denote the character of the representations spanned by the direct sum of these representations by χ_{sum}. By the Schur orthogonality relations [Eq. (14)], we have the following relation:
with equality if and only if all these spaces carry irreducible subrepresentations. Noting that we have yet to include the spaces V_{1}, V_{2}, V_{{1}}, V_{{2}}, V_{[1]}, and V_{[2]}, we can write the character of φ^{⊗2} as
where χ_{i} is the character associated with the subrepresentation carried by the space V_{i}. Combining Eqs. (144) and (15), we now conclude that
From Lemma 2, we note that ⟨χ_{φ^{⊗2}},χ_{φ^{⊗2}}⟩=30 for q ≥ 3. This means that all spaces mentioned must carry irreducible subrepresentations of φ^{⊗2} and that the spaces V_{0}, V_{r}, V_{[A]}, V_{1}, V_{2}, V_{{1}}, V_{{2}}, V_{[1]}, and V_{[2]} must carry mutually inequivalent irreducible representations. We can make the same argument for q = 2 noting that the space V_{[2]} = 0 (and hence does not contribute to the character inner product) and that for q = 2 we have ⟨χ_{φ^{⊗2}},χ_{φ^{⊗2}}⟩=29. This completes the classification of the irreducible representations of the two-copy representation φ^{⊗2} of the q-qubit Clifford group C_{q}.
IV. CONCLUSION
We characterized the two-copy representation of the multi-qubit Clifford group and identified three distinct cases, namely, the single-qubit [analyzed in Ref [11]], two-qubit, and many-qubit cases, which contain 7, 13, and 14 irreducible representations, respectively.
As the Clifford group plays a central role in quantum information, we expect the present analysis to have many applications such as state and channel tomography, analysis of fault-tolerance thresholds, large-deviation bounds [15], and state distinguishability (as analyzed in Refs [16–18]). As a concrete example, we have used results from the present paper in the companion paper [12] to provide a much sharper analysis of the statistical performance of randomized benchmarking [6,19]. While this result advances understanding of the representation theory of the Clifford groups, there remain several open questions about general representation theory of multi-qubit Clifford groups. First and foremost, the character table of the Clifford group is unknown. Working out this table would greatly assist future studies. This paper has identified several distinct irreducible representations, which should assist in the construction of the character table. Finally, these results hold for qubits and generalizing them to higher dimensional systems remains an open problem.
While writing the current results, the authors became aware of an equivalent result due to Zhu, Kueng, Grassl, and Gross [16–18], where the fourth tensor power representation of the Clifford group (which is closely related to the two-copy representation) is analyzed using techniques from stabilizer codes and used to construct projective 4-designs out of the orbits of the Clifford group, analyze POVM norm constants and applied to the problem of phase retrieval.
APPENDIX A: PROOF OF LEMMA 1
Lemma 1. Let τ, τ′ ∈ σ_{q}, and τ ≠ τ′. The following equalities hold
Also for all τ ∈ σ_{q}, we have
Proof. Let τ, τ′ ∈ σ_{q}, and τ ≠ τ′. We begin by noting that N_{τ} is the complement of Ĉ_{τ} in σ^{q} and that |Ĉ_{τ}|=|N_{τ}|=d^{2}2 for all τ ∈ σ_{q}. This allows us to make the following statements:
We can solve this system of equations to obtain
The rest of the argument will proceed by induction on the number of qubits q (recall that d = 2^{q}). For q = 1, we have that
From Eqs. (A6)–(A8), we then have that
Now assume Eq. (A1) to hold up to q − 1. For τ ∈ σ_{q}, we can write
where by A ⊗ B we mean A ⊗ B ≔ {a ⊗ b ∥ a ∈ A, b ∈ B}. Now we can write
where the last line holds by the induction hypothesis and the fact that all sets in the equation are disjoint. This proves the first half of the lemma. Now take τ ∈ σ_{q} and consider the sets N_{σ0},Ĉ_{σ0}. It is trivial to see that N_{σ0}=∅ and Ĉ_{σ0}=σ^{q}. Since |N_{τ}|=|Ĉ_{τ}|=d^{2}2, the second half of the lemma also follows.
