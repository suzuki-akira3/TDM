Identification of F impurities in F-doped ZnO by synchrotron X-ray absorption near edge structures
Synchrotron X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) measurements of F K-edge in conjunction with first-principles calculations are used to identify the local structure of the fluorine (F) atom in F-doped ZnO. The ZnO film was grown by pulsed laser deposition with an Nd:YAG laser, and an oxyfluoridation method was used to introduce F ions into the ZnO films. The measured XANES spectrum of the sample was compared against the first-principles XANES calculations based on various models for local atomic structures surrounding F atoms. The observed spectral features are attributed to ZnF_{2} and F_{O} defects in wurtzite bulk ZnO.
I. INTRODUCTION
ZnO has been attracting attention recently because of its properties suitable for optoelectronic devices operating in the blue, violet, and ultra-violet regions. ZnO has a band gap of 3.3 eV at room temperature. It also has a lattice constant similar to those of GaN-based semiconductors which are currently the main materials for short wavelength light emitting diodes (LEDs) [1,2] and solid state lasers [3]. ZnO has a large exciton binding energy of 60 meV. This makes it a very efficient excitonic emitter at room temperature or higher. Therefore, a ZnO-based light emitter is expected to be a very efficient light emitter [4]. Moreover, high quality bulk ZnO crystals can be easily and cheaply grown [1]. However, to utilize ZnO in optoelectronic applications, both high quality n- and p-type ZnO with carrier concentration in excess of 10^{17} cm^{−3} are necessary. Unfortunately, similar to other wide-bandgap semiconductors, ZnO suffers from the so-called doping asymmetry [5]. Despite a lot of efforts both theoretically and experimentally, obtaining a high quality p-type ZnO still remains challenging.
Yan and Wei [6] proposed that a defect complex, consisting of a Zn vacancy (V_{Zn}) and the F substitution for O (F_{O}), i.e., the V_{Zn}-F_{O} complex, could be a candidate for the p-type dopant in ZnO. Because of the high electronegativity of F, F is expected to interact with V_{Zn} and reduce its ionization energy, while V_{Zn} by itself is a deep acceptor [6]. To check the feasibility of this proposal, it is important to identify the local structure of F atoms in ZnO and investigate the possible formation of V_{Zn}-F_{O}. Here, we investigate the detailed atomic structures and formation energies of the V_{Zn}-F_{O} defect complexes and other fluorine-containing defects as a possible source of p-type dopants in ZnO.
To characterize F-doped ZnO samples, we use an x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) technique. By selecting the x-ray energy that matches with a particular excitation energy of the element of interest, e.g., an F atom, we can probe the local electronic structure as well as the surrounding atomic structures of a target atom. The XAS technique is, therefore, a very powerful and highly selective technique. XAS is traditionally divided into two regions: (1) x-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and (2) extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). Both regions can be used to identify the local structures of material systems. For the EXAFS analysis, the coordination number and the bond distances can be easily resolved by using a Fourier transform of the spectra based on the scattering theory. However, for XANES spectral analysis, first-principles calculations are needed to simulate the spectra of potential local structures to compare and seek the best matched with the measured XANES. We have previously employed the combination of XANES measurements and first-principles calculations to identify the local structures of various systems [7–10].
In this paper, we employed first-principles calculations of the formation energies of various F defects in ZnO to identify potential defects or defect complexes that are energetically preferred. In conjunction with first-principles results of the local structures of F defects, we analyze the F K-edge synchrotron XANES measurements and resolve the local structures of F atoms in F-doped ZnO samples.
II. EXPERIMENTS
The ZnO film was grown on a SiO_{2}/Si substrate by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) with an Nd:YAG laser (λ = 266 nm). Sintered wurtzite ZnO was used as a target for laser ablation with an average energy density of 1.1 J/cm^{2} per each pulse and a repetition rate fixed at 10 Hz. During the film deposition, the processing chamber was controlled to have the oxygen partial pressure [P(O_{2})] of 5 × 10^{−2 }Torr and the substrate temperature was kept at room temperature. The thickness of the film is about 100 nm. This growth technique is known to produce ZnO under O-poor conditions. The details of the growth technique can be found in Ref [11]. F ions were introduced into the ZnO films by an oxyfluoridation method [12]. F ions ejected from a Teflon ring by sputtering with an RF voltage source (50 W) could react at the surface of the ZnO film. The penetration depth of F introduced into the ZnO film is about 25 nm with the concentration monotonically reduced from the surface. The F concentration at the ZnO:F surface estimated by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy is around a tenth of the Zn concentration.
The XAS at F K-edge was performed at the 2A beamline of the Pohang Light Source. The total electron yield mode was used to measure the absorption coefficients. The direction of the incident x-rays was set to normal to the plane of the thin film sample.
III. COMPUTATIONAL METHODS
A. Crystal structure and formation energy
We investigate F-related defects in wurtzite ZnO by using first-principles calculations. The calculations are based on density functional theory (DFT) within local density approximation. For the electron-ion interactions, the corrections for the on-site Coulomb interaction (LDA + U) and projector augmented wave potentials [13], as implemented in the VASP code [14,15], were employed. The cutoff energy for the plane-wave basis is set to 400 eV. The calculated lattice parameters of ZnO, the unit cell of which has 2 formula units of ZnO, i.e., 4 atoms, are a = 3.148 Å, c/a = 1.606, and u = 0.381, which are in good agreement with the experimental values of a = 3.249 Å, c/a = 1.602, and u = 0.381 [16]. The calculated results are in good agreement with the calculation results of other groups [17]. To calculate the formation energies of defects, a supercell approach is used [18–20]. All atoms in the supercell are allowed to relax according to the minimization of the Hellmann-Feynman force until the forces become less than 0.01 eV/Å. A supercell with 72 atoms, which is a 3 × 3 × 2 repetition of the primitive wurtzite unit cell, is used. For the Brillouin zone integration, a 2 × 2 × 2 Monkhorst-Pack special k-point mesh is employed. The electronic structures are calculated using a special k-point scheme, as explained in Ref [21]. The calculated band gap is 1.53 eV, which is in good agreement with other theoretical works [22]. However, it is significantly smaller than the experimental band gap (3.3 eV) due to a well-known DFT band gap underestimation.
For a supercell, the defect formation energy is defined as [18,19]
where E_{tot}(D^{q}) is the calculated total energy of the cell with defect D in charge state q. E_{tot}(0) is the calculated total energy of the cell without any defect and Δn_{x} is the number of atoms of species (x =Zn, O, or F) being removed from a defect-free cell, to its respective reservoir with chemical potential μ_{x}, to form the defect cell. E_{F} is the energy of the electron reservoir whose electrons are exchanged. The chemical potential reflects the elemental partial pressure of each element. E_{v} is the valence band maximum (VBM), the average value of which at all special k-points are used [21]. To bound the upper limits for μ_{Zn} and μ_{O}, the energies per atom for metallic Zn and the O_{2} molecule are used. In order to grow the ZnO crystal in equilibrium, the following equation must be satisfied, μ_{ZnO}=μ_{Zn}+μ_{O}, where μ_{ZnO} is the formation energy of wurtzite ZnO. For the chemical potential of fluorine (μ_{F}), the energy per F atom of ZnF_{2} and of F_{2}O_{2} are used for Zn- and O-rich conditions, respectively.
B. X-ray absorption spectroscopy
To understand the measured XANES features, we use a first-principles approach to simulate the XANES spectra of F at various locations in wurtzite ZnO. Fully relaxed local structures are obtained from the supercell calculations for each F defect configuration, and their results are used as an input to the FEFF8.2 codes [23,24] for the simulation of XANES. The code employs a full-multiple scattering approach based on first-principles overlapping muffin-tin atomic potentials, where those potentials are obtained from self-consistent calculations with the Hedin-Lundqvist exchange-correlation function [25]. By constructing a sphere with a radius of 8 Å (containing approximately 200 atoms) around the absorbing atom (in this case, F), the self-consistent calculations are obtained. The test results of the simulations of both Zn K-edges and O K-edges show good agreement with the measured spectra of pristine ZnO. This ensures the reliability of the method employed for our simulations.
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The calculated formation energies of F-related defects as well as other native defects in ZnO are illustrated in Fig. 1 under two extreme growth conditions, i.e., Zn-rich and O-rich conditions. The formation energies of native defects and F-containing defects depend on the growth conditions. To interpret the calculated results of formation energy in conjunction with experiments under different growth conditions, one may have to incorporate the results with appropriate growth conditions using these two limiting cases. For example, the formation energy of an interstitial F atom (F_{i}) depends on the growth conditions in such a way that the chemical potential of the F atom (μ_{F}) is limited by the energy per atom of the F atom in ZnF_{2} for Zn-rich conditions and the F_{2}O_{2} molecule for O-rich conditions. From Eq. (1), the formation energies of charged defects also depend on the electron reservoir (or Fermi energy, E_{F}), which can vary from the valence band maximum (VBM) to the conduction band minimum (CBM). The calculated defect formation energies in Fig. 1 are shown as a function of Fermi energy varying from 0 eV (corresponding to the VBM level) to 3.3 eV, the experimental band gap of ZnO (corresponding to the CBM level).
Our results for the formation energy of oxygen vacancy (V_{O}) are in reasonable agreement with the previous calculations by Van de Walle's group [17,22]. Based on the formation energies of F-containing defects in wurtzite ZnO, there are three defects likely to form: (1) the F-substitution for O (F_{O}), (2) a defect complex consisting of the interstitial F on the octahedral site and the F-substitution for O (F_{i(oct)}-F_{O}), and (3) another defect complex consisting of the F-substitution for Zn and the F-substitution for O (F_{Zn}-F_{O}). The relaxed local geometries of these defects are shown in Fig. 2. From the results of formation-energy calculations, the defects of F_{O}, F_{i(oct)}-F_{O}, and F_{Zn}-F_{O} act as a donor, an amphoteric defect, and an acceptor, respectively. Under Zn-rich growth conditions, as shown in the left panel of Fig. 1, the formation energy of F_{O} is the lowest among other defects at Fermi energies within the calculated bandgap of 1.53 eV. This means that F prefers to be the substitute at the oxygen site under Zn-rich growth conditions for both p-type and n-type ZnO. However, under O-rich growth conditions, as shown in the right panel of Fig. 1, the formation energy of F_{i(oct)}-F_{O} is the lowest when the Fermi energy is within 1.0 eV above the VBM, i.e., p-type conditions. For the higher Fermi level, i.e., n-type conditions, F_{Zn}-F_{O} is more likely to form. Thus, under O-rich growth conditions, F atoms prefer to form a complex which can be either F_{i(oct)}-F_{O} or F_{Zn}-F_{O}, depending on the carrier condition of the sample. Indeed, the formation energies of single defects like F_{O} or F_{i(oct)} lie higher than those of F-defect complexes. The previous work on the formation energies of F_{O} or F_{i(oct)} provides even higher values [26], which is consistent with our conclusion that the single F defects are not relevant under O-rich growth conditions. The V_{Zn}-F_{O} complex, which was previously suggested to be the source of p-type when ZnO is doped with F (Ref [6]) has a higher formation energy than that of F_{Zn}-F_{O}, rendering the former difficult to form. Energetically, F_{Zn}-F_{O}, which is also an acceptor defect, is expected to form instead of V_{Zn}-F_{O}. Both F_{Zn}-F_{O} and V_{Zn}-F_{O} can be the sources of p-type conductivity due to their negative stable charge states (F_{Zn}-F_{O}: 2− and V_{Zn}-F_{O}: 1−) and low formation energies. Although, F_{Zn}-F_{O} has a lower formation energy than that of V_{Zn}-F_{O}, its formation energy is still much higher than that of F_{O} and F_{i(oct)}-F_{O} (both of which are donor and neutral, respectively) at the Fermi level near the VBM. The complex might serve as a compensating acceptor defect, but it might be difficult to obtain high hole conductivity by doping F into ZnO, as suggested in previous study [6].
To further explore the stability of these defect complexes, we have also calculated their binding energies. The binding energy of a complex is defined as
where E^{f}(A), E^{f}(B), and E^{f}(AB) are the formation energy of an isolated defect A, an isolated defect B, and a complex AB, respectively. A positive binding energy indicates that the complex is stable against separation into two individual defects, i.e., it is bound. Note, however, that having a positive binding energy does not guarantee the formation of a complex. Generally, the magnitude of binding energy as well as the mechanism how two defects coalesce into one complex also plays a role in determining the complex defect formation. Nevertheless, having a positive binding energy is mandatory for the stability of a defect complex. The calculated binding energies of V_{Zn}-F_{O}, F_{Zn}-F_{O}, and F_{i(oct)}-F_{O} are 0.85, 1.60, and 1.07 eV, respectively. Hence, these candidates for the defect complex satisfy their requirement.
To understand XANES features from the measurements, we performed first principles simulations of F K-edge XANES for F at various locations in wurtzite ZnO. Figure 3 compares the measured and simulated XANES. The measured spectrum is shown in the top panel [Fig. 3(a)], while the middle [Fig. 3(b.1)] and bottom panels [Fig. 3(b.2)] display the simulated spectra of different F structures. Figure 3(b.1) shows the calculated spectra of F impurities in wurtzite ZnO, namely F_{O} and its complexes with V_{Zn}. As described in Sec. III, the first-principles method with a supercell approach was used to obtain the optimized crystal structure of each defect. The optimized structures are shown in Fig. 2. The XANES spectra are generated based on these structures. The measured and calculated spectra [Figs. 3(a) and 3(b.1)] have similar features. It is noted, however, that the calculated spectra have to be shifted by about 11 eV to align features with the measured one.
In the lower-energy part of the spectra, there is a strong-absorption peak p_{1} at 692 eV and a shoulder s_{1} near 696 eV, respectively. In the higher-energy part of the spectra, the absorption features are significantly smaller and broader. There is a weak-absorption peak p_{2} at 712 eV. The calculated spectra, which are not relevant to the measured data, are not presented here. Also, it is noted that the spectrum of F_{O} and its complexes with V_{Zn} are taken from their most stable charge states (F_{O}: 1+, V_{Zn}-F_{O}: 1−, and V_{Zn}-2F_{O}: 0). Forming a defect complex with V_{Zn} has little effect on the XANES features of F_{O}. We can see that F_{O} and its complexes with V_{Zn} have similar features, except that F_{O} has a stronger main absorption peak than its complexes, as shown in Fig. 3(b.1). Therefore, it is difficult to distinguish the isolated F_{O} from the F_{O}-Zn vacancy complexes by XANES. However, the relative stability between the isolated F_{O} and the F_{O}–Zn vacancy complexes can be determined from the formation energy. Under Zn-rich conditions, F_{O} has lower formation energy than that of V_{Zn}-F_{O} and V_{Zn}-2F_{O}, as seen in the left panel of Fig. 1. Therefore, F_{O} should be the main species that contributes to the observed XANES. However, under O-rich conditions, F_{O} has lower formation energy than that of V_{Zn}-F_{O} only when the Fermi level is below 0.9 eV, i.e., under p-type conditions. Whereas, when the Fermi level is above 0.9 eV, the V_{Zn}-F_{O} is more stable, as shown in the right panel of Fig. 1. For peak p_{1} and shoulder s_{1}, as indicated by the red- and light-blue-dashed arrows in Fig. 3, the features of the calculated F_{O} (as well as its complexes with V_{Zn}) XANES do not fit well.
The measured spectrum has a big broad peak at p_{1} and a somewhat stronger shoulder s_{1} compared to the simulated XANES associated with F_{O}. We suspect that a phase precipitate ZnF_{2} might be formed as an inclusion in the sample and is responsible for the difference. Figure 3(b.2) shows the spectra calculated from bulk-ZnF_{2}. We can see that the calculated XANES of F in ZnF_{2} has a peak in the middle of p_{1} and can fill-in the splitting of the two main peaks of the calculated F_{O} XANES. In addition, XANES of ZnF_{2} also enhanced the shoulder s_{1}. To test whether the combination of F_{O} XANES and ZnF_{2} XANES can fit the actual measured XANES of F doped ZnO, we combine them using several ratios and plot them in the same graph as shown in Fig. 4(a). We found that, roughly, the ratio of 1:1 of the combination of F_{O} and ZnF_{2} can reproduce well the p_{1} and s_{1} of the measurement with the direct comparison shown in Fig. 4(b). In addition, the p_{2}-p_{1} peak separation of the simulated spectra and that of the observed spectrum are in good agreement (about 20 eV). The disagreement between the simulated and measured XANES in the magnitude of the high-energy part might be partly due to the imperfect background subtraction. Of course, we cannot rule out the possibility that other defects or compounds related to F may be the origin of the discrepancies.
V. CONCLUSIONS
We have studied the local structures surrounding the fluorine atom in F-doped ZnO. The ZnO sample was grown by pulse laser deposition and F was introduced by an oxyfluoridation method. The synchrotron x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) technique is used to study the F K-edge of the sample. To interpret the measured result, we use the results of first-principles calculations to study the F-related defects and identify the defects with low formation energies and defect complexes that are stable. The stable F-related defect structures are used to calculate their associated XANES spectra. We found that the measured XANES features are best described by the F-substitution for O (F_{O}) in ZnO or the defect complex consisting of F_{O} and Zn vacancy, both of which have similar XANES spectra. We also found that some discrepancy that exists between the measured XANES and the calculated F_{O} XANES can be attributed to the XANES of phase precipitated ZnF_{2} that has likely incorporated in the sample during the growth process.
