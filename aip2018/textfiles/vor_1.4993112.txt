Validity of amplitude equations for nonlocal nonlinearities
Amplitude equations are used to describe the onset of instability in wide classes of partial differential equations (PDEs). One goal of the field is to determine simple universal/generic PDEs, to which many other classes of equations can be reduced, at least on a sufficiently long approximating time scale. In this work, we study the case when the reaction terms are nonlocal. In particular, we consider quadratic and cubic convolution-type nonlinearities. As a benchmark problem, we use the Swift-Hohenberg equation. The resulting amplitude equation is a Ginzburg-Landau PDE, where the coefficients can be calculated from the kernels. Our proof relies on separating critical and noncritical modes in Fourier space in combination with suitable kernel bounds.
I. INTRODUCTION
In this work, we study the nonlocal Swift-Hohenberg (SH) equation
where (x,t)∈R×[0,∞), p∈R is a (small) parameter, u=u(x,t)∈R, and K, Q are given symmetric finite measures; here * denotes convolution in the spatial coordinate. The terms u(Q * u) and u(K * (u^{2})) are the quadratic and cubic nonlocal nonlinearities in (1). Before we discuss our main result, we provide a brief overview of amplitude (or modulation) equations as well as recent results on nonlocal partial differential equations (PDEs), which provide the motivation to consider (1). The rigorous analysis of (1) and our mathematical contribution starts in Sec. II.
In dynamical systems, one common approach to deal with local instabilities is to derive a standard system, which represents the dynamics of an entire class [24]. Consider an ordinary differential equation (ODE)
with an equilibrium point z_{*} undergoing a local bifurcation upon variation of a parameter p, say, at p = 0. The standard method [14] consists in first deriving a low-dimensional center manifold M^{c}. The manifold M^{c} is tangent to the center eigenspace of Df(z_{*}; 0). On M^{c}, the dynamics is low-dimensional and can be brought into a normal form by first Taylor-expanding and then using coordinate transformations to eliminate as many polynomial terms up to a given order [24,30]. This procedure yields several generic classes of low-dimensional ODEs, which can then be analyzed.
A similar strategy is available for many PDEs [17,18,26]. A typical class is
where L is a linear differential operator and F(u; p) = F is the nonlinearity. Suppose u_{*} is a steady state of (2) for all p. If the spectrum σ(L+DF(u_{*};p)) is contained in the left-half of the complex plane, then u_{*} is locally linearly stable [25]. Upon parameter variation of p, say, without loss of generality at p = 0, a bifurcation occurs, when σ(L+DF(u_{*};0))∩iR≠∅ and suitable genericity conditions hold, i.e., transversal crossing of the spectrum and nondegeneracy of the nonlinearity [18,26]. As for an ODE, we may ask, whether there is a simple generic normal form, now called the amplitude or modulation equation, to describe the formation of nontrivial patterns near p = 0. For a bounded domain Ω and suitable L, one may often use standard centre manifold reduction [7,50] for point spectrum crossing iR at p = 0. However, for cases involving unbounded domains, one usually faces essential spectrum crossing iR, which presents substantial challenges as one expects the amplitude equation to be a PDE, not an ODE, in this context [18].
The development of the field of amplitude equations has a long history and a benchmark problem is to consider the local Swift-Hohenberg equation [13,31,33,43]
where N(u) is a given nonlinearity, frequently taken as a quadratic-cubic polynomial. The spectrum of the linearized operator has two quadratic tangencies with iR for p = 0. To derive an amplitude equation formally, one possibility is to use the method of multiple scales [8,26,27,29] in combination with the ansatz
where X are the new scaled variables with X_{i}=x_{i}ε^{ai} for some exponents a_{i} > 0, T = tε^{b} is a scaled time for some b > 0, k∈Z^{d} is a suitably chosen wave vector, and A is a slowly modulated amplitude governing the envelope of the fast Fourier modes. One re-writes (3) using the doubled number of variables (x, t; X, T) via the chain rule, inserts an asymptotic series
into the resulting PDE, and then uses (4) to derive a PDE for A(X, T). For example, d = 1, N(u)=−u^{3}, and k = 1 yield the (real) Ginzburg-Landau equation [5,32,35]
The next step is to prove rigorous validity of the approximation, which has been discussed in many publications for local PDEs; see, e.g., Refs [28],  [42],  [44],  [45], and  [49]. The typical structure of the approximation results is the following: Assume that the amplitude equation has a solution A of a certain regularity over a time scale T ∈ [0, T_{*}] and ‖ψ_{A}(⋅,0)−u(⋅,0)‖≲ε^{α0} for all x in the spatial domain. Then one proves
where various choices of the (space-variable) norm ∥·∥ can be considered. For example, in the case (3)–(5) with α_{0} = 2, α = 2, and β = 2, one may prove [28] a uniform pointwise O(ε^{2})-approximation over a long time scale of order O(T_{*}/ε^{2}).
There have been several recent studies, using a multiple scales approach to formally derive amplitude equations also in the case when the nonlinearity is nonlocal. Morgan and Dawes [38] studied a Swift-Hohenberg equation (3) for d = 1 with the nonlocal nonlinearity
where c_{2},c_{3}∈R are parameters. They provided the formal derivation of the amplitude equation in the case (7), calculated the coefficients in the Ginzburg-Landau equation for two classes of the kernel K explicitly, and provided numerical bifurcation studies of the amplitude equation. Hence, their work provides immediate motivation to investigate the rigorous validity of amplitude equations for our nonlocal Swift-Hohenberg equation (1). Indeed, (7) is just a special case of the nonlinearity in (1) as we allow δ-measures to appear in the kernels Q, K. Moreover, Roberts [39] indicates that in order to obtain an accurate model of convection, one has to include a nonlocal nonlinearity of the form u∫_{R}K(⋅−y)u(y,t){2}dy in the Swift-Hohenberg equation (3).
Faye and Holzer [20] have studied the nonlocal Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piscounov (FKPP) equation [23],
which has raised considerably interest recently in the literature; see, e.g., Refs [2],  [4],  [9],  [10], and  [22]. Faye and Holzer are interested in modulated travelling fronts bifurcating from the monotone FKPP invasion wave upon variation of c_{2}. Part of the work of Faye and Holzer [20] contains a multiple scales ansatz to derive amplitude equations for the modulated fronts, which again yields a Ginzburg-Landau equation with coefficients that can be calculated from the kernel Q. As in the case of (7), also (8) provides strong motivation to investigate nonlocal nonlinearities and related amplitude equations in more detail.
The model problem (1) can also be motivated more abstractly. It contributes to the general interest to obtain a better understanding of nonlocal nonlinearities. Examples include neural field equations [12,16], phase-field models [6,15], nonlocal singular perturbation problems [11,21], various types of reaction-diffusion PDEs [40,46,48], nonlocal Schrödinger equations [1,3], nonlocal models in vegetation pattern formation [34,47], and vast classes of PDEs with constraints, e.g., elliptic-parabolic systems with elliptic part solvable in the integral form. For all these scenarios, rigorous results on amplitude equations are going to be relevant.
Our main result for (1) can informally be stated as follows: Recall Q, K are finite measures, which are symmetric so that they obey the same symmetry of the spectrum of the linearized Swift-Hohenberg equation. Consider the local Ginzburg-Landau equation for an amplitude A, where the coefficients in this equation can be calculated from the Fourier transforms of Q, K. Suppose A(X, T) is a sufficiently regular solution for T ∈ [0, T_{*}] and ‖ψ_{A}(⋅,0)−u(⋅,0)‖{C^{4}}≲ε^{2}, then
with ψ_{A}(x,t)=ε(A(εx,ε^{2}t)e^{ix}+A¯(εx,ε^{2}t)e^{−ix}); see also Theorem II.8.
In some sense, our result is the natural analog to the classical local result, and we include the local result as a special case in our approach. The key proof strategy is to generalise techniques from Refs [37] and  [41] to the nonlocal case using suitable a priori bounds. Although these bounds do not yield the exact cancellation property initially developed in Ref [28] via an improved higher-order approximation, the kernel bounds do still yield the correct error order, i.e., only produce terms of order O(ε^{3}) in the final result. Our method is designed to be general enough to handle larger classes of PDEs, not just (1), as we only use the spectral information from the linear part, and the nonlinearity contains the first two important forms of quadratic and cubic terms. However, the Swift-Hohenberg model problem already shows very clearly the key steps required in the analysis. In summary, our results provide a step toward a more general theory of amplitude equations for nonlocal PDEs.
II. ASSUMPTIONS AND MAIN RESULT
We now specify the assumptions used throughout this work, and we precisely state the main result we are going to show. Therefore, we recall (1) and note that the considerations in Sec. I suggest the scaling p = ε^{2} with a small parameter ε > 0. Thus, we are led to study the equation
The precise assumptions on the convolution kernels Q and K will be given below (see Sec. II A).
A. Assumptions on Q and K
In the remainder of this work, the convolution kernels Q and K are assumed to be finite symmetric measures on R, i.e., Q,K∈M^{fin}(R) and is symmetric, such that it holds
Remark II.1. Note that throughout this work, we will use the notation Q(dx) = Q(x)dx and K(dx) = K(x)dx for simplicity although Q and K might not have a Lebesgue density. Thus all integrals occurring have to be interpreted accordingly. In particular, we write by abuse of the notation fQ{L^{1}} for the expression ∫_{R}fQ(dx) and equivalently also for K.Since our analysis relies crucially on the use of the Fourier transform, we have to restrict moreover at certain places to measures Q and K which can be decomposed as
Here, S denotes the Schwartz space of smooth and rapidly decaying functions, while the dual space of tempered distributions will be denoted by S^{′} throughout this work. We emphasise that the usual embedding M^{fin}(R)⊂S^{′} yields that we may consider Q_{s} and K_{s} also as elements in S^{′}.
Remark II.2. We note that (12), in particular, implies (11) while (12) also allows for purely “local” nonlinearities if we choose Q = qδ(·) and K = kδ(·).
Remark II.3. Assumption (12) is required to ensure that the Fourier transforms of Q and K are smooth functions. The latter property is needed to show that the Fourier transform of the non-linear terms in (1), which contain usual products as well as convolutions, is well-defined (see also, the Proof of Lemmas III.8 and III.9).To simplify the notation at several places, we define
such that (10) can be written as
Moreover, we have the following continuity property for the convolution operators induced by Q and K.
Lemma II.4. For eachk∈N_{0}, there exists a constant C > 0 such that it holds
and
for allB_{ℓ}∈Cbk(R)with ℓ ∈ {1, 2, 3} and alln∈Z.
Remark II.5. Throughout this article for k∈N_{0}, we denote by Cbk(R) the Banach space of k-times differentiable functions on R with bounded derivatives. Moreover, we note the following well-known relation:
with a constant C(k) > 0 which only depends on k.
Proof of Lemma II.4. We first note that it suffices to prove (13) because (14) follows from the latter replacing Q by K, which satisfies the same assumptions, and exploiting (15). Since Q is a finite measure by assumption, it is well-known that we have the estimate
This already proves (13) for k = 0. For general k∈N, we use the property ∂xk(f*g)=f*(∂xkg) for convolutions together with (15) which yields
This shows (13) and thus finishes the proof as explained above.Finally, we introduce some notation, i.e., the assumption (11) allows us to define the constants
Moreover, we note that due to the symmetry of Q and K it also holds
and thus, in particular, k_{n},q_{n}∈R for all n∈Z.
B. Main result
As explained in Sec. I, one expects that a solution u of (10) can be approximated by a function of the form
provided that the initial condition u_{0} = u(·, 0) is sufficiently close to ψ(·, 0) and A is a solution to the Ginzburg-Landau equation. Precisely, under our assumptions on Q and K, formal calculations suggest to take A as solution of
The following proposition guarantees the existence of a solution to (18) at least locally in time.
Proposition II.6. Assume thatA_{0}(⋅)∈Cb4(R). Then there exists T_{*} > 0 such that there exists a unique solutionA=A(X,T)∈C[0,T_{*}],Cb4of (18) with A(·, 0) = A_{0}.
Proof. This statement follows easily by an application of the contraction mapping theorem.
Remark II.7. We assume A_{0}(⋅)∈Cb4(R) since we want to work in the space C[0,T_{*}],Cb4. The same assumption can also be found in other studies, e.g., Ref [28]. In Ref [36], the approximation of the local Swift-Hohenberg equation could be shown under the assumption that A_{0} is bounded in L^{2} using evolutionary Γ-convergence.We can now state the main result that we will show in this work.
Theorem II.8. LetA∈C[0,T_{*}],Cb4be a solution of (18). Then for each d > 0, there exist constants ε_{*}, C > 0 such that for all ε ∈ (0, ε_{*}) the following statement holds. Ifu0−ψ(⋅,0){C^{4}}≤dε^{2}, then there exists a unique solution u of (10) on the time interval [0, T_{*}/ε^{2}] with u(·, 0) = u_{0}, and moreover we have the estimate
C. Notation and outline
In order to prove Theorem II.8, we will follow the same approach as in Ref [41], and thus, instead of showing that ψ is a good approximation for solutions of (10), we will consider the intermediate approximation
with X = εx and T = ε^{2}t. The operator E_{0} acts as a cut-off function in Fourier variables to select modes which are sufficiently close to zero. The precise definition of E_{0} is given in (27). The coefficients A, A_{0}, and A_{2} are chosen such that A is a solution of (18), while A_{2} and A_{0} are given by
One key ingredient in the Proof of Theorem II.8 is to consider the critical Fourier modes e^{±ix} separately from the uncritical ones. Therefore, one defines
such that ϕ = εϕ_{c} + ε^{2}ϕ_{s}. According to Lemma III.3 below, E_{0} as defined in (27) is a bounded operator from C^{0} to C^{m} for each m∈N. We then have the following lemma which states that ϕ_{s} is uniformly bounded and ϕ is uniformly close to ψ up to an error of O(ε^{2}).
Lemma II.9. LetA∈C([0,T_{*}],Cb4(R))be a solution of (18) and ϕ_{c}and ϕ_{s}be given by (21) together with (20). Then there exists a constant C > 0 such that it holds
where ϕ = εϕ_{c} + ε^{2}ϕ_{s}and ψ is defined in (17).
Proof. The bound on ϕ_{s} is an immediate consequence of the assumptions on A, the definition of A_{0} and A_{2} in (20), and Leibniz’ rule, while we also note that the operator E_{0} commutes with ∂_{x} and is bounded from C^{0} to C^{m} for each m∈N (see Lemma III.3 below).To verify the second estimate of the lemma, we note that
Thus, combining Lemma III.4 below with Leibniz’ rule as well as the first estimate of the lemma, the claim easily follows.The main strategy to prove Theorem II.8 is now as follows. First, we note that Lemma II.9 yields that ψ can be approximated by ϕ on the time interval [0, T_{*}/ε^{2}] up to an error of O(ε^{2}). As a consequence, it is enough to prove Theorem II.8 with ψ replaced by ϕ. The general approach for this will be to consider the approximation error R = u − ϕ and to show that this quantity remains of O(ε^{2}) on [0, T_{*}/ε^{2}]. To this end, we will derive an evolution equation for R and show that there exists a unique solution which is small on [0, T_{*}/ε^{2}]. Since u is on the other hand uniquely determined on a small time interval, this then yields that u also exists on [0, T_{*}/ε^{2}] by a standard continuation argument. One crucial part within this approach consists in obtaining suitable estimates for the residuum of ϕ which is defined as
The study of this expression will be contained in Sec. IV. Moreover, in Sec. V, we will derive the equation which has to be satisfied by R, while we already note, that in order to obtain that R stays of O(ε^{2}) on [0, T_{*}/ε^{2}], it will be necessary to consider the critical and uncritical modes separately. Based on these preparations, we will then provide the proof of Theorem II.8 in Sec. VI. Moreover, in Sec. III, we recall several technical definitions and properties from Ref [41] which will be used frequently.
D. Main difference to local nonlinearity
To conclude this section, we will finally point out one main difference between the proof of Theorem II.8 and the corresponding result for local nonlinearities, i.e., the equation
as, for example, considered in Ref [37]. However, as mentioned in Remark II.2, this equation is still contained as a special case in our Theorem II.8.
As explained above, we follow the same main approach as in Refs [37] and  [41] by computing and estimating Res(ϕ) in order to show that the approximation error R = u − ϕ remains small. However, in the case where the nonlinearity is given as N(u) with a polynomial N, the choice of A together with (20) yields that in Res(ϕ) several expressions of lower order in ε exactly cancel. In contrast to this, when we consider the more general nonlocal nonlinearities as in (10), this is no longer the case. To circumvent this problem, we have to use Proposition II.10 below, which states that although the lower order expressions do not cancel, we can still gain at least one order in ε for the remainder. It will turn out that this suffices to show that the corresponding expressions are of order O(ε^{4}), while the dynamics of the problem to leading order is only determined by expressions up to O(ε^{3}). Thus, as in Ref [41], the terms of O(ε^{4}) do not have to be considered explicitly but can just be estimated by a constant. Consequently, the effect of the non-local non-linearities essentially enters through different coefficients in (18).
Proposition II.10. For eachn∈Zthere exists a constant C > 0 such that it holds
for allB_{ℓ}∈Cb1(R)with ℓ ∈ {1, 2, 3}.
Proof. We first note that
Thus, analogously to the Proof of Lemma II.4, it suffices to prove (23) since (24) then follows replacing Q by K and using (15). To show (23), we note that (25) together with (15) yields
Therefore, it suffices to show
To do this, we note that ∂_{x}B_{ℓ}(εx) = ε(∂_{X}B_{ℓ}) (εx) and B_{ℓ}∈Cb1(R) which yields
Thus, since |q_{n}| and Qe^{ni⋅}{L^{1}} are bounded, it only remains to show that
To see this, we note that B_{2}(ε(x−y))−B_{2}(εx)≤εB2{C^{1}}y for all x,y∈R, and we recall the definition of q_{n} in (16) such that we obtain
This shows (26) and thus finishes the proof.
III. TECHNICAL PREPARATION
Our strategy to prove Theorem II.8 follows closely the one in Ref [41], where the equation
has been considered, and we thus recall in this section several technical fundamentals. Moreover, we provide the necessary adaptations and extensions that we need for the situation that we consider in this work. More precisely, we will work in the space Cb4(R) of four time differentiable functions with globally bounded derivatives. As already indicated before, one key ingredient is to consider the critical Fourier modes e^{±ix} separately from the uncritical ones. This will be achieved by suitable multiplication operators in Fourier space, the so-called mode filters. This approach makes it necessary to work with the Fourier transform which is not directly defined on the space Cb4(R). However, as also pointed out in Ref [41], we can embed Cb4(R) into S^{′}, where the Fourier transform is defined in the usual way by duality.
We recall now the definition of the mode filters as given in Ref [41], and for this, we will denote by I_{r}(x) the open interval of radius r centered around x, i.e., I_{r}(x) = (x − r, x + r). One then fixes nonnegative and even functions χ_{c},χ_{0}∈Cc∞(R) which satisfy
For these functions, we additionally define G_{c} and G_{0} as the inverse Fourier transforms, i.e.,
The mode filters E_{c}, E_{0}, E0c, and E_{s} are then defined as
Remark III.1. If we denote by F the Fourier transform, it is well-known that for v∈S it holds F(E_{c}v)=χ_{c}F(v) as well as F(E_{0}v)=χ_{0}F(v). Moreover, since χ_{c} and χ_{0} have compact support, it holds, in particular, χ_{c},χ_{0}∈S such that (27) makes even sense for v∈S^{′} since the convolution between tempered distributions and Schwartz functions is well-defined.
Remark III.2. We additionally remark that E_{s} and E0c can also be represented as convolution operators, with kernels G_{s} = δ − G_{c} as well as G0c=δ−G_{0}. The corresponding Fourier transforms are given by χ_{s} = 1 − χ_{c} and χ0c=1−χ_{0}. Note that in this case, G0c and G_{s} are only measures due the fact that the Fourier transforms have unbounded support.For technical reasons, it is also necessary to introduce further operators
and which are defined via C^{∞}-functions χch and χsh. More precisely, χch∈Cc∞(R) is chosen such that it vanishes outside I_{3/8}(−1) ∪ I_{3/8}(1), while χsh vanishes in I_{1/16}(−1) ∪ I_{1/16}(1).With these definitions, we can cite three results on the mode filters which are contained in Ref [41] as Lemmas 3–5.
Lemma III.3. The operators E_{c}and E_{0}are linear and continuous mappings from C^{0}to C^{m}. For every m ≥ 0, there exists C_{m} > 0 withE0u{C^{m}}+Ecu{C^{m}}≤C_{m}u_{C^{0}}.
Lemma III.4. Forn∈N, there is a C_{n} > 0 such that(E0cA(ε⋅)){C^{n}}=(E0A(ε⋅))−A(ε⋅){C^{n}}≤C_{n}ε^{n}A_{C^{n}}.
Lemma III.5. For u_{1}, u_{2} ∈ C^{n}andr_{1},r_{2}∈N, it is true that
The last statement essentially says that the product of two functions with critical Fourier modes only contains uncritical modes. This result relies on the observation that the support supp(χ_{c}) satisfies the relation
where the sum in parentheses has to be understood as the usual sum of subsets of R.However, since we have to deal with non-linearities which are in general convolutions, we will need an extension of Lemma III.5. In order to prove this, we also require the following well-known result about the convolution of distributions (see, for example, Ref [19]).
Lemma III.6. Letu,v∈S^{′}and assume that either u orvhas compact support. Then the convolution u * vexists inS^{′}, and moreover, it holdsF(u*v)=F(u)F(v). This means, in particular, that the product on the right-hand side exists inS^{′}.
Remark III.7. As a consequence of Lemma III.6, it also holds that F(uv)=(2π){−1}F(u)*F(v) provided that u,v∈S^{′} such that either F(u) or F(v) has compact support.We can then show the following generalisation of Lemma III.5.
Lemma III.8. For alln∈ZandB_{1},B_{2}∈S^{′}with the Fourier transform supported inI¯{1/4}(−1)∪I¯{1/4}(1), it holds
In particular,B_{1}((Qe^{ni⋅})*B_{2})∈S^{′}is well-defined.
Proof. Due to the assumptions on Q, it is well-known that F(Qe^{in⋅})∈C^{∞}. Thus, since F(B_{1}) and F(B_{2}) are assumed to have compact support, Lemma III.6 yields that B_{1}((Qe^{ni⋅})*B_{2})∈S^{′} exists and
From this relation, we immediately conclude the corresponding inclusions for the supports as
where the plus sign indicates the sum between subsets of R. By assumption, we have supp(F(B_{1})),supp(F(B_{2}))⊆I¯{1/4}(−1)∪I¯{1/4}(1) which implies
Since the choice of χ_{c} yields supp(χ_{c}) ∩ Ω = ∅, the claim follows from (30) and (31) together with the definition of E_{c}.In a similar fashion, we have the following result which provides information on the support in Fourier space for the operators induced by Q and K.
Lemma III.9. For alln∈ZandB_{1},B_{2},B_{3}∈S^{′}with the Fourier transform supported inI¯{1/4}(0), the expressions B_{1}((Qe^{ni⋅}) * B_{2}) and B_{1}((Ke^{ni⋅}) * (B_{2}B_{3})) are well-defined inS^{′}, and it holds
Proof. Similarly as in the proof of Lemma III.8, one finds together with Lemma III.6 and Remark III.7 that B_{1}((Qe^{ni⋅}) * B_{2}) and B_{1}((Ke^{ni⋅}) * (B_{2}B_{3})) are well-defined, and it holds
and
From these relations, the claim immediately follows due to the assumptions on the support of F(B_{1}), F(B_{2}), and F(B_{3}).For later use, we also recall the following semi-group estimates which are stated in Ref [41].
Lemma III.10. Lete^{Lt}denote the semi-group associated with the operatorL. Then there exist constants C, σ > 0 which are independent of ε such that it holds
whereEchandEshare specified in (28).
IV. THE RESIDUUM
In this section, we will compute the residuum as defined in (22), and moreover, we will derive several estimates which we will need for the proof of the main statement.
A. Computing the residuum
Since we only need estimates on the C^{1}-norm of Res(ϕ), one can easily verify that the assumptions of Theorem II.8 together with Lemma III.3 yield that all derivatives which occur during the computation of Res(ϕ) are uniformly bounded on the relevant time interval. More precisely, this is immediately clear for the purely spatial derivatives. However, the following lemma states that also the C^{1}-norm of the time derivative is uniformly bounded.
Lemma IV.1. LetA∈C^{0}([0,T_{*}],Cb4(R))be a solution of (18), and A_{0}and A_{2}be given as in (20). Then it holds
for some constant C > 0.
Proof. Due to (20), it holds A_{0} = −2q_{1}AĀ and A_{2} = −(q_{1}A^{2})/9. Thus, we have
Since both A and Ā solve (18), the claim easily follows.As a consequence, it suffices to consider only terms up to O(ε^{3}), and we will therefore only compute explicitly these terms, while all expressions of O(ε^{4}) are just estimated by a constant.To simplify the presentation, we first compute the different expressions separately and then finally collect all the terms. Moreover, we skip the argument of the functions in order to improve the readability, and we use the common notation c.c. to indicate the complex conjugate. First of all, we obtain
Moreover, it holds (1+∂x2){2}=1+2∂x2+∂x4 and we have
Similarly, we obtain
If we also note that ε^{2}ϕ=ε^{3}(E_{0}A)e^{ix}+c.c.+O(ε^{4}), we already get
In order to compute the nonlinear terms, we will use the general relation
We note that these manipulations are rigorously justified in the expressions where we will use this below. In particular, we find
For the cubic terms, we obtain in the same way
To obtain a representation for Res(ϕ) [see (22)], we summarise (32)–(34), while we group terms with equal Fourier modes e^{iℓx} together. Note that for our analysis, only the terms up to O(ε^{3}) are important which is why we estimate higher order terms just by a constant contained in O(ε^{4}). Precisely, we obtain
with a_{−ℓ} = ā_{ℓ} and
B. Estimating the residuum
In this section, we provide several estimates on Res(ϕ) that we will need later on. More precisely, the next lemma states that the pre-factor for the uncritical modes is of order ε^{3}, while that one for the critical modes can even be bounded by ε^{4}.
Lemma IV.2. There exists a constant C > 0 such that it holds
where a_{ℓ}is given by (35) for ℓ ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3}.The following relations will be used in the proof of the lemma.
Remark IV.3. For each n∈Z and functions B, B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}, we have the relations (E_{0}B)=(E0cB)+B as well as
and
Proof of Lemma IV.2. We consider first a_{0}. Since A_{0} = −2q_{1}AĀ, we obtain by means of Remark IV.3 that
Due to Proposition II.10 and Lemma II.4 and A_{0} = −2q_{1}AĀ, we thus obtain
Lemmas III.3 and III.4 together with the uniform boundedness of A thus yield
To estimate a_{2}, we can proceed in the same way; i.e., Lemma III.3 together with the boundedness of A yields 24iε^{3}∂X(E0A2){C^{1}}≤Cε^{3}. Thus, it remains to estimate −9(E_{0}A_{2}) − (E_{0}A) ((Qe^{−i⋅})*(E_{0}A) (ε⋅)) which can be rewritten by means of Remark IV.3 and (20) as
Proposition II.10 and Lemmas II.4, III.3, and III.4 as well as A_{2} = −(q_{1}A^{2})/9 and the uniform boundedness of A then imply that
uniformly with respect to t ∈ [0, T_{*}/ε^{2}].Moreover, due to the choice of A_{2} together with Lemmas II.4 and III.3, one immediately gets a3{C^{1}}≤Cε^{3} for all t ∈ [0, T_{*}/ε^{2}]. Summarising, this shows (36).Thus, it only remains to prove (37), and for this we proceed similarly as before. More precisely, we first note that Remark IV.3 allows us to rewrite
Since A solves (18), we further get
Therefore, it remains to estimate the C^{1}-norm of
However, since |A|^{2}A = A^{2}Ā, this can be done in the same way as for a_{0} and a_{2}.As a consequence of Lemma IV.2, we can now prove the following result which provides bounds on the restrictions of Res(ϕ) to critical and uncritical Fourier modes.
Proposition IV.4. For each solutionA∈C([0,T_{*}],Cb4)of (18) and ϕ as in (19), there exists a constant such that it holds
Proof. The proof follows easily from Lemma IV.2. Precisely, we note that Res(ϕ)=∑ℓ=−33a_{ℓ}e^{iℓx} with a_{ℓ} as in (35) and a_{−ℓ} = ā_{ℓ}. Moreover, E_{s} = 1 − E_{c}, and thus, due to Lemma III.3, we deduce that E_{s}: C^{1} → C^{1} is linear and bounded. Therefore, in order to verify the first claimed estimate, it suffices to show that
which is however an immediate consequence of Lemma IV.2.To prove the second claim of the lemma, we note that the definition of E_{0} together with Lemma III.9 yields that a_{ℓ} is supported in [−3/4, 3/4]. Thus, we find that the Fourier transform of a_{ℓ}e^{iℓ⋅} is supported in B¯{3/4}(ℓ). Since χ_{c} ≡ 0 on B¯{3/4}(ℓ) for ℓ ∈ {0, ±2, ±3}, we get that E_{c}(Res(ϕ))=E_{c}(a_{1}e^{ix}+ā_{1}e^{−ix})+O(ε^{4}). However, Lemma III.3 implies that E_{c}: C^{1} → C^{1} is bounded and thus the second claim of the lemma follows immediately from Lemma IV.2.
V. AN EQUATION FOR THE APPROXIMATION ERROR
In this section, we will derive the equation which the approximation error R has to satisfy and we will mainly use the same notation as in Ref [41]. As already mentioned before, it will be necessary to treat the critical Fourier modes e^{±ix} separately from the uncritical ones and we therefore write
where ϕ_{c} and ϕ_{s} have been defined in (21). Moreover, to shorten the notation, we also use R := ε^{2}R_{c} + ε^{3}R_{s} such that it holds u = ϕ + R. If we plug this into (10), it follows
If we now insert R = ε^{2}R_{c} + ε^{3}R_{s} and recall that Res(ϕ)=−∂_{t}ϕ+L(ϕ)+N(ϕ), this can be further rearranged as
If we divide by ε^{2} and reorganise, we finally end up with
where we write
and
As in Ref [41], we now exploit that Lemma III.8 implies E_{c}L_{2}(R_{c}) = 0 and E_{c}N_{2}(R_{c}) = 0 to separate the equation for R. Precisely, we apply the identity operator Id = E_{c} + E_{s} to (38) such that we obtain
with the abbreviations
Remark V.1. Note that if R_{c} and R_{s} solve (39), the sum R_{c} + εR_{s} gives a solution to (38).
Remark V.2. The existence of a unique solution to (39) locally in time can be shown by a standard fixed-point argument, similarly as in Ref [41]. Note that for this, it is important that the nonlinear terms are locally Lipschitz continuous which might be easily deduced from Lemma II.4.Moreover, we have the following estimates on the linear operators L_{c} and L_{s}.
Lemma V.3. There exists a constant C > 0 such that it holds
for the operators L_{c}and L_{s}as given in (40).
Proof. These estimates follow immediately from Lemma II.4 together with the boundedness of the operators E_{c} and E_{s}.
VI. PROOF OF THEOREM II.8
Based on the preparations in Secs. IV and V, we will now give the proof of our main result.
Proof of Theorem II.8. We first introduce some notation, namely, for fixed T ≥ 0 and n∈N, we define the Banach space
Moreover, we note that one may easily deduce from Lemma II.4 together with the boundedness of E_{c} and E_{s} that for each D > 0, there exists M_{D} > 0 such that it holds for all t > 0 that
Furthermore, we recall from Proposition IV.4 that
Finally, due to the assumptions on the initial data, we have
By means of the semi-group e^{Lt} and the relations EchE_{c}=E_{c} as well as EshE_{s}=E_{s} [see (28)], we can rewrite (39) as
From Lemmas III.10 and V.3 and (42), we thus obtain that
as long as the condition in (41) holds. For R_{c}, we proceed similarly, while we additionally exploit (44) and (43) and the assumption t ≤ T_{*}/ε^{2} to find
Due to Gronwall’s inequality and the assumption t ≤ T_{*}/ε^{2}, we obtain
If we use this estimate together with (43), it follows from (44) that
If we now fix first D_{*} > 0 sufficiently large and then ε_{*} = ε_{*}(D_{*}) > 0 sufficiently small, one immediately deduces from (46) and (47) that it holds Rc{Bt4}+εRs{Bt4}≤D_{*} for all t ∈ [0, T_{*}/ε^{2}] provided ε ≤ ε_{*}. Thus, the error R = ε^{2}R_{c} + ε^{3}R_{s} remains in the ball of radius D_{*} (with respect to ⋅_{C^{4}}) for all t ∈ [0, T_{*}/ε^{2}].Since R = u − ϕ, we thus find together with Lemma II.9 that
The existence and uniqueness of u now follows straightforward. Precisely, by a standard fixed-point argument, one gets that there exists a unique solution u to (10) on a small time interval. Due to the approximation result that we have just shown, this solution cannot blow up—and can thus be extended uniquely—on the interval [0, T_{*}/ε^{2}].
