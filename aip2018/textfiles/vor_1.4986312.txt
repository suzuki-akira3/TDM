Interface spacing, stability, band offsets, and electronic properties on a (001) SrHfO_{3}/GaAs interface: First-principles calculations
SrHfO_{3} is a potential dielectric material for metal–oxide–semiconductor devices. The SrHfO_{3}/GaAs interface has attracted attention because of its unique properties. In this paper, the interface properties of (001) SrHfO_{3}/GaAs are investigated by first-principles calculations based on density functional theory. First, the adsorption behavior of Sr, Hf, and O atoms on the GaAs surface is investigated. An O atom has a lower adsorption energy on a Ga surface than on an As surface. Then, some possible (001) SrHfO_{3}/GaAs configurations are considered to analyze the interface spacing, stability, band offsets, and charge transfer. The SrO/Ga(1) and HfO_{2}/Ga(2) configurations are lower in binding energy than other interface configurations, indicating that they are more stable. Finally, we study the electronic properties of the SrO/Ga(1) and HfO_{2}/Ga(2) configurations. The electronic density of states suggests that these systems exhibit metallic behavior. The band offset and charge transfer are related to the interface spacing. The valence band offset and charge transfer decrease with increasing interface spacing.
I. INTRODUCTION
In order to reduce the feature size of metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs), it is necessary to replace the traditional silicon dioxide gate dielectric with a high-permittivity (high-κ) material [1,2]. A great deal of research effort has been dedicated to high-κ dielectrics, including Si_{3}N_{4} [3], Ge_{3}N_{4} [4], Gd_{2}O_{3} [5], La_{2}O_{3} [6], Y_{2}O_{3} [7], Al_{2}O_{3} [8], ZrO_{2} [9], HfO_{2} [10], SrTiO_{3} [11], and SrHfO_{3} [12–15]. Among these, SrHfO_{3} is a promising candidate because of its good current–voltage characteristics, large band offsets, high dielectric constant, and low frequency dispersion. Meanwhile, GaAs-based MOSFETs exhibit promising performance because of their high electron velocities [16]. It has been found that single-crystal interfaces usually possess excellent properties. For example, a single-crystal Gd_{2}O_{3}/GaAs interface exhibits a very low leakage current density, with values ranging from 10^{–9} to 10^{–10 }A/cm^{2} [5]. Cubic SrHfO_{3} has an experimental lattice constant of 4.07 Å, which is approximately equal to the in-plane spacing of GaAs (4.00 Å) [17]. This provides convenient conditions for the production of single-crystal SrHfO_{3}/GaAs interfaces.
A number of theoretical and experimental studies have been done on SrHfO_{3} [17–21]. Mcdaniel et_al [17] successfully deposited crystalline SrHfO_{3} films on Ge substrates and found that the valence band offset (VBO) and conduction band offset (CBO) were 3.27 eV and 2.17 eV, respectively. Sousa et_al [18] successfully deposited epitaxial SrHfO_{3} films on Si substrates and measured a band gap of 6.1 eV optically. Wang et_al [19] studied the electronic and structural properties of SrHfO_{3} by first-principles calculations. The adsorption of Ga and As atoms on SrO and HfO_{2} surfaces was systematically investigated. In practice, the oxide is usually deposited on semiconductor substrates [18,22,23]. It is more realistic to study the adsorption behavior of Sr, Hf, and O atoms on a GaAs surface. This behavior can provide useful information for determining the interface stability. However, to date, there have been no detailed theoretical or experimental studies of SrHfO_{3} growth on GaAs.
In this paper, we investigate the growth of SrHfO_{3} on GaAs substrates. The adsorption behavior of Sr, Hf, and O atoms on GaAs surface is studied. We investigate the stability of SrHfO_{3}/GaAs by calculating the binding energy. Band alignment between SrHfO_{3} and GaAs is investigated. The interface behavior is analyzed in terms of the charge transfer and the electronic density of states.
II. COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS
The calculations of the structural and electronic properties of SrHfO_{3} and GaAs are performed using the CASTEP code, which is based on density functional theory and the plane-wave pseudopotential method. The local density approximation (LDA) is chosen as the exchange correlation functional. The valence electron configurations for Sr, Hf, Ga, As, and O are taken as 4s^{2}4p^{6}5s^{2},5d^{2}6s^{2},3d^{10}4s^{2}4p^{1},4s^{2}4p^{3}, and 2s^{2}2p^{4}, respectively. The cores are represented by a norm-conserving pseudopotential, while the valence states are expanded in a plane-wave basis set with an energy cut-off of 600 eV. A 6 × 6 × 6 k-point sampling is used for the SrHfO_{3} and GaAs calculations, and is generated by the Monkhorst–Pack scheme [24]. The crystal structures of SrHfO_{3} and GaAs are shown in Fig. 1. The geometry optimization terminates when the maximum force on each atom is less than 0.01 eV/Å. The calculated lattice constant for SrHfO_{3} is 4.02 Å, which is in agreement with the theoretical value of 4.16 Å (Ref [21]) and the experimental value of 4.07 Å [17]. It is a little larger than the in-plane spacing of GaAs, which is 3.94 Å. The lattice mismatch between SrHfO_{3} and GaAs is estimated to be 2.0%, which is in good agreement with the reported value of 1.8% [19]. The band gaps calculated using the LDA functional are EgGaAs(LDA)=0.78eV and EgSrHfO_{3}(LDA)=3.60eV. We attempt to improve the band gaps using a hybrid Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof functional (HSE) [25–29]. The values calculated using the HSE functional are EgGaAs(HSE)=1.58eV and EgSrHfO_{3}(HSE)=5.37eV, which are close to the experimental values of EgGaAs=1.42 eV (Refs [16] and  [30]) and EgSrHfO_{3}=6.01eV [17].
In order to investigate the interface properties of (001) SrHfO_{3}/GaAs, we construct a 2 × 2 surface supercell. Because SrHfO_{3} is usually grown on a GaAs substrate, the lattice constants of the interface are determined by those of GaAs. The interface consists of 11-layer SrHfO_{3} and 17-layer GaAs. A vacuum region of 15 Å is used to prevent interaction between the top and bottom layers. The GaAs slab consists of alternating layers of Ga and As atoms, while the SrHfO_{3} slab consists of alternating layers of SrO and HfO_{2}. In order to avoid the polarization effects, SrHfO_{3} and GaAs are modeled using a symmetric slab [11,19]. Ten possible interface configurations are considered, as shown in Fig. 2. These configurations are created by depositing SrO or HfO_{2} layers on a Ga or As surface. An atom located at the center of four Ga or As atoms is called a fourfold hollow site. An atom located between Ga or As atoms is called a bridge site. For the HfO_{2}/Ga(1) interface, four Hf atoms are located on the top of Ga atoms and eight O atoms are located at the bridge sites. For the HfO_{2}/Ga(2) interface, four O atoms are located on the top of Ga atoms, four O atoms at the fourfold hollow sites, and four Hf atoms at the bridge sites. For the HfO_{2}/Ga(3) interface, eight O atoms are located at the bridge sites and four Hf atoms at the fourfold hollow sites. For the SrO/Ga(1) interface, four O atoms are located on the top of Ga atoms and four Sr atoms at the fourfold hollow sites. For the SrO/Ga(2) interface, O and Sr atoms are located at the bridge sites.
It is well known that the LDA functional underestimates the band gaps of semiconductors and insulators. Therefore, a nonlocal functional is usually used to investigate the band gap [29]. However, the adsorption energy and binding energy depend only on the system energy difference, so the result calculated using the LDA functional can be considered reliable [31,32]. The parameters for the interface calculation are different from those for the bulk calculation. A 2 × 2 × 1 k-point sampling is used for integrations over the Brillouin zone. In the geometry relaxations, the atoms near the interface and the vacuum region are allowed to relax. The polarization inside the SrHfO_{3} and GaAs slabs does not affect the atomic relaxation.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. The (001) SrHfO_{3}/GaAs interface
First, we study the adsorption behaviors of O, Sr, and Hf atoms on the (001) GaAs slab. This slab has a vacuum region of 15 Å. The adsorbed atom gradually moves closer to the adsorption site. The adsorption energy is defined as follows [33]:
where E(GaAs + ads) is the total energy of an adsorption system with an adatom, E(GaAs) is the total energy of the clean (001) GaAs slab, and E(ads) is the energy of the adatom. We examine these adatoms at the fourfold hollow site, the bridge site, and the top site of a Ga or As atom. Table I presents the calculated results. For the Ga surface, Sr and Hf atoms preferentially adsorb at Ga fourfold hollow sites, while O atoms preferentially adsorb at Ga bridge sites. Similar results can also be found on the As surface. It should be noted that the adsorption energy of an O atom is lower on the Ga surface than on the As surface, which is in agreement with the results of a previous investigation [34]. Wang et_al [19] investigated the adsorption behavior of Ga and As atoms on SrO and HfO_{2} surfaces. They found that Ga and As atoms are preferentially adsorbed at the top of O atoms, and that the adsorption of an As atom is more favored energetically than the adsorption of a Ga atom. We investigate the growth behavior of SrHfO_{3} deposited on a GaAs substrate, whereas they analyzed the growth behavior of GaAs deposited on an SrHfO_{3} substrate. The difference between their findings and ours is due mainly to different film growth mechanisms [35,36].
In order to investigate the stability of the (001) SrHfO_{3}/GaAs interface, we also calculate the interface binding energy, which is defined as [37]
where E_{i} (SrHfO_{3}/GaAs) is the total energy of the SrHfO_{3}/GaAs interface, E_{s} (SrHfO_{3}) and E_{s} (GaAs) are the total energies of the SrHfO_{3} and GaAs surfaces, respectively, S is the cross-sectional area of the interface, and the division by 2 arises because of the presence of two identical interfaces in the supercell. In this study, we accurately determine the interface spacing in two steps. We first roughly estimate the interface spacing by a total energy calculation. We do not allow the atoms to relax, but calculate the total energy of the system at different interface spacings. The interface spacing is changed in the range from 1 Å to 5 Å with an interval of 0.1 Å. Figure 3 shows the binding energy versus interface spacing. Although a symmetric slab is considered in the calculation, the binding energy curves can still reflect the binding characteristics of different interfaces. The lowest binding energy and interface spacing are –0.022 eV/Å^{2} and 2.9 Å for HfO_{2}/Ga(1), –0.031 eV/Å^{2} and 2.1 Å for HfO_{2}/Ga(2), –0.015 eV/Å^{2} and 2.3 Å for HfO_{2}/Ga(3), –0.049 eV/Å^{2} and 1.9 Å for SrO/Ga(1), –0.019 eV/Å^{2} and 2.5 Å for SrO/Ga(2), –0.019 eV/Å^{2} and 2.9 Å for HfO_{2}/As(1), –0.011 eV/Å^{2} and 2.9 Å for HfO_{2}/As(2), –0.008 eV/Å^{2} and 2.8 Å for HfO_{2}/As(3), –0.012 eV/Å^{2} and 2.6 Å for SrO/As(1), and –0.012 eV/Å^{2} and 2.8 Å for SrO/As(2). The negative binding energy indicates that the interface is stable. It is found that the binding energies for HfO_{2}/Ga(2) and SrO/Ga(1) are lower than those for other interface configurations, which suggests that the HfO_{2}/Ga(2) and SrO/Ga(1) interfaces are more stable. The binding energy curve of the HfO_{2}/As(2) interface exhibits an abnormal peak, which is independent of the chosen exchange correlation functional and spin polarization. This abnormal behavior may be due to competition between the Hf–As and O–As interactions. The binding energy is –0.325 eV/Å^{2} for the CoO/MnO interface [38], –0.033 eV/Å^{2} for the Cu_{2}ZnSnS_{4}/ZnO interface [39], and –0.315 eV/Å^{2} for the Mg/Al_{4}C_{3} interface [40].
In order to accurately determine the interface spacing, we allow the atoms near the interface and the vacuum region to fully relax. The system has its lowest energy at the optimized interface spacing. Therefore, the interface spacing is determined by the lowest energy. The value is 2.8 Å for HfO_{2}/Ga(1), 2.2 Å for HfO_{2}/Ga(2), 2.3 Å for HfO_{2}/Ga(3), 1.7 Å for SrO/Ga(1), 2.4 Å for SrO/Ga(2), 2.9 Å for HfO_{2}/As(1), 2.5 Å for HfO_{2}/As(2), 2.8 Å for HfO_{2}/As(3), 2.9 Å for SrO/As(1), and 2.8 Å for SrO/As(2). Table II gives the binding energy, band offsets, atom migration, and charge transfer under optimized interface spacing. The values in parentheses are the interface spacings without atom relaxation. Some of the interface spacings change slightly after atom relaxation. The interface spacing for a stable heterojunction is in the range 1.5–3.0 Å [41,42]. The binding energy changes only slightly after atom relaxation, except for the HfO_{2}/As(1) interface. HfO_{2}/Ga(2) and SrO/Ga(1) are still lower in the binding energies than other interface configurations.
Atoms near the interface will migrate after atom relaxation. A positive value of the migration indicates that the atom moves toward the interface, while a negative value indicates that it moves away from the interface. The results show that an O atom has a larger migration on an HfO_{2} layer than on an SrO layer. An Hf atom has a smaller migration than an Sr atom. The migration of Ga and As atoms is less than 0.1 Å. The charge in Table II represents the charge transfer from the GaAs slab to the SrHfO_{3} slab, which is the number of extra electrons on the SrHfO_{3} slab. The interface characteristics can be investigated by analyzing the charge transfer [43]. It should be noted that the HfO_{2} layer attracts electrons more readily than the SrO layer. This may be due to the fact that the HfO_{2} layer has more oxygen atoms than the SrO layer. The charge is –0.70 e for HfO_{2}/Ga(1), –1.08 e for HfO_{2}/Ga(2), –0.72 e for HfO_{2}/Ga(3), –0.40 e for SrO/Ga(1), and –0.08 e for SrO/Ga(2). Because the electronegativity of an As atom is greater than that of a Ga atom, the charge transfers at the HfO_{2}/As and SrO/As interfaces are smaller than those at the HfO_{2}/Ga and SrO/Ga interfaces. Anomalous charge transfer is observed for the SrO/As(1) and SrO/As(2) interfaces. The charge is 0.17 e for SrO/As(1) and 0.20 e for SrO/As(2), which suggests that As atoms obtain electrons from the SrO layer.
In the potential alignment method, the valence band offset (VBO) is determined by two terms [11,44]
The first contribution, ΔE_{v}, corresponds to the alignment of the valence band maximum (VBM) for the bulk band structure term. The second contribution, ΔV, corresponds to the macroscopic averaged electrostatic potential (AEP) alignment. Because of the error between the calculated and experimental band gap, we cannot obtain the exact CBO from the calculated band gap. In this study, we obtain the CBO from the relation CBO=VBO+EgSrHfO_{3}(EXP)−EgGaAs(EXP) [39]. Table II shows that the VBO and CBO are closely related to the interface configurations, which is in agreement with the results of previous investigations [45–48]. The VBO and CBO are determined to be 2.89 eV and 1.70 eV for HfO_{2}/Ga(1), 4.40 eV and 0.19 eV for HfO_{2}/Ga(2), 3.57 eV and 1.02 eV for HfO_{2}/Ga(3), 4.38 eV and 0.21 eV for SrO/Ga(1), 2.91 eV and 1.68 eV for SrO/Ga(2), 2.50 eV and 2.09 eV for HfO_{2}/As(1), 2.81 eV and 1.78 eV for HfO_{2}/As(2), 3.04 eV and 1.55 eV for HfO_{2}/As(3), 2.12 eV and 2.76 eV for SrO/As(1), and 1.92 eV and 2.67 eV for SrO/As(2). The VBO and CBO for an ideal MOS device should be larger than 1 eV in order to effectively prevent leakage current. Previous investigation showed that the VBO and CBO were 2.66 eV and 1.33 eV for ZrO_{2}/GaAs [49]. Yang and Park [50] found that the VBO for a La_{2}O_{3}/GaAs interface was about 1.7 eV. Jin et_al [51] found that the experimental VBO changed from 2.86 eV to 3.36 eV when the annealing temperature was increased from 600°C to 800°C.
In this study, we do not consider the effect of interface defects, although such defects inevitably exist in real interfaces. Alay-e-Abbas et_al [52] investigated the formation energies of vacancy defects in SrHfO_{3}. Their results showed that ordered oxygen vacancies in an HfO_{2} layer were energetically favored. Chen et_al [53] made a systematic study of the stability diagram and electronic properties of (110) SrHfO_{3} polar terminations. They found that atomic defects on the surface layer dominated the stabilization for SrHfO_{3}. We believe that defects near the SrHfO_{3}/GaAs interface will affect the band offset, which is a topic for further study.
B. Interface properties of HfO_{2}/Ga(2) and SrO/Ga(1) configurations
Figure 4 shows a schematic representation of the band alignment for HfO_{2}/Ga(2) and SrO/Ga(1). The planar and macroscopic AEPs are also shown. The planar AEP in the atomic region exhibits periodic oscillations, while it remains constant in the vacuum region (see the blue curve), which is in agreement with the results of previous investigations [3,4,54]. In order to accurately calculate the band offsets, we have to eliminate the effect of interface polarization. Polarization inside SrHfO_{3} and GaAs can be avoided by considering a symmetric slab. In the calculations, a dipole correction is also applied to remove possible interface polarization induced by the charge transfer between the oxide and semiconductor. For HfO_{2}/Ga(2), the macroscopic AEP value is –12.14 eV for SrHfO_{3} and –7.31 eV for GaAs. E_{v} (the valence band maximum) and E_{c} (the conduction band minimum) are –6.55 eV and –0.54 eV for SrHfO_{3}, and –2.17 eV and –0.75 eV for GaAs. For the SrO/Ga(1) interface, the macroscopic AEP is –14.85 eV for SrHfO_{3} and –10.00 eV for GaAs. E_{v} and E_{c} are –9.26 eV and –3.25 eV for SrHfO_{3}, and –4.86 eV and –3.44 eV for GaAs. The VBO and CBO for HfO_{2}/Ga(2) and SrO/Ga(1) are also shown in Fig. 4.
We investigate the VBO and charge transfer versus interface spacing for HfO_{2}/Ga(2) and SrO/Ga(1) interfaces, with the results shown in Fig. 5. For the HfO_{2}/Ga(2) interface, the VBO changes only slightly for interface spacings in the range 2.1–2.8 Å. This reflects the strong interaction between SrHfO_{3} and GaAs. The VBO decreases as the interface spacing varies from 2.8 Å to 3.2 Å, which corresponds to weakening of the interface interaction. This result can be verified by the behavior of the charge transfer. It is found that the charge on the SrHfO_{3} slab decreases with an increase in interface spacing: it changes from –1.08 e to –0.60 e as the spacing increases from 2.1 Å to 3.2 Å. A similar behavior is also found on SrO/Ga(1). Compared with HfO_{2}/Ga(2), the charge transfer at SrO/Ga(1) is small. It should be noted that the interface spacing affects the band offsets, resulting in deviations between theoretical and experimental results [55–58].
The layer electronic density of states for SrO/Ga(1) and HfO_{2}/Ga(2) is presented in Fig. 6. The chemical formula of the symmetric slab is Hf_{20}Sr_{24}O_{64}/Ga_{36}As_{32} for SrO/Ga(1) and Hf_{24}Sr_{20}O_{68}/Ga_{36}As_{32} for HfO_{2}/Ga(2). To elucidate the effect of polarization on interfacial properties, we also investigate an SrHfO_{3}/GaAs interface with ideal stoichiometry. The chemical formula is Hf_{20}Sr_{20}O_{60}/Ga_{32}As_{32} for the SrO/Ga(1) and HfO_{2}/Ga(2) configurations, which is also called an asymmetric slab. It is found that SrO/Ga(1) and HfO_{2}/Ga(2) exhibit metallic behavior, which is in agreement with the results of a previous investigation [19]. The metallic behavior of HfO_{2}/Ga(2) and SrO/Ga(1) occurs only in several atomic layers near the interface. The polarization inside SrHfO_{3} and GaAs does not affect the interface behavior. The gap states in SrHfO_{3} are determined mainly by Hf 5d, Sr 4d, and O 2p. The gap states in GaAs are dominated by Ga 4s, 4p and As 4s, 4p. We believe that the metallic nature of the interface is mainly a result of interfacial charge transfer, which will lead to carrier tunneling and will increase the leakage current of electronic devices based on this material [59,60]. Wang et_al [19] explained the metallicity of the SrHfO_{3}/GaAs interface in terms of surface electron accumulation. Alay-e-Abbas et_al [52] found that the metallic behavior in SrHfO_{3} was due to charge transfer between vacancy sites and hafnium dangling bonds. In order to eliminate the metallic interface, electrons near the interface should be able to form stable covalent bonds. These interface issues require further study.
To further understand the bonding, the electron density difference of SrO/Ga(1) is shown in Fig. 7. The charge density is mainly distributed around the O atoms, while the Sr and Hf atoms have almost no charge density. In the GaAs slab, the charge density is mainly distributed between the Ga and As atoms. Because an As atom has a greater electronegativity than a Ga atom, the charge density is slightly closer to the As atoms. This result strongly suggests that ionic bonds are formed between the O and Sr (Hf) atoms, while polar covalent bonds are formed between the Ga and As atoms. We also test the effect of polar SrHfO_{3} and GaAs slabs on the electron density. We do not see any obvious change in the electron density with polar SrHfO_{3} and GaAs slabs. A similar behavior is also found at the HfO_{2}/Ga(2) interface. This analysis is consistent with previous investigations [61–63]. Charge transfers for the SrO/Ga(1) and HfO_{2}/Ga(2) interfaces occur mainly between the interfacial O and Ga atoms. The O atoms near the interface will acquire more electrons than those in the bulk SrHfO_{3}, while the Ga atoms near the interface will lose more electrons than those in the bulk GaAs. The interaction between the interfacial O and Ga atoms should be via typical ionic bonds.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
The geometrical structures and electronic properties of an SrHfO_{3}/GaAs interface have been investigated using the density functional theory. The adsorption of O atoms is more favored on a Ga surface than on an As surface. Ten possible interface configurations on the SrHfO_{3}/GaAs interface have been investigated. The results show that the band offsets, interface spacing, binding energy, and charge transfer are different among the ten configurations. The interface spacing is in the range of 1.7–2.9 Å. The charge transfer is in the range from 0.20 e to –1.08 e. Both HfO_{2}/Ga(2) and SrO/Ga(1) interfaces are lower in the binding energy than other interface configurations, which suggests that they have a stable structure. The electronic density of states for HfO_{2}/Ga(2) and SrO/Ga(1) suggests that they exhibit metallic behavior. Charge transfer occurs mainly from interfacial Ga atoms to O atoms, which suggests that ionic bonds are formed between these atoms. As the interface spacing increases, the VBO begins to undergo small changes and then monotonically decreases. We have also found that charge transfer decreases with increasing interface spacing, which corresponds to a weakening interface interaction.
