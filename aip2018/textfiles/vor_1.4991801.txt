Describing chaotic attractors: Regular and perpetual points
We study the concepts of regular and perpetual points for describing the behavior of chaotic attractors in dynamical systems. The idea of these points, which have been recently introduced to theoretical investigations, is thoroughly discussed and extended into new types of models. We analyze the correlation between regular and perpetual points, as well as their relation with phase space, showing the potential usefulness of both types of points in the qualitative description of co-existing states. The ability of perpetual points in finding attractors is indicated, along with its potential cause. The location of chaotic trajectories and sets of considered points is investigated and the study on the stability of systems is shown. The statistical analysis of the observing desired states is performed. We focus on various types of dynamical systems, i.e., chaotic flows with self-excited and hidden attractors, forced mechanical models, and semiconductor superlattices, exhibiting the universality of appearance of the observed patterns and relations.
I. INTRODUCTION
The scientific description of chaotic behavior, proposed by Edward N. Lorenz during his studies on the weather models in the 1960s, has been one of the most important moments in the history of development of the dynamical systems theory. For the first time, theoretically unpredictable and uncommon type of motion has been presented in an elegant mathematical sense. Since then, many great studies on chaotic dynamics have been published [1–5] and this peculiar type of behavior is nowadays observed in various areas of science, just to mention physics [6], chemistry [7], biology [8,9], or economy [10].
One of the most interesting phenomenon connected with complex dynamics, which is recently thoroughly studied by researchers, is the multistability property of systems, i.e., possession of many, co–existing attractors [11–20]. This type of behavior has been found in vibro–impact systems [11], stochastic oscillators [12,13], models induced by weak periodic perturbations [14], or networks of weakly coupled units [15]. The nature of attractors' basins in multistable systems has been studied in Refs [16] and  [20], while in Refs [17] and  [18], the problem of control of multistability is analyzed. On the other hand, in Ref [19], the authors investigate how to obtain extreme multistability in coupled dynamical models.
The problem of multistability is closely related with hidden [21–29] and rare [28,30–34] attractors, which can appear in a unpredictable way in system's dynamics. The former ones, which are defined as the states that cannot be traced using unstable fixed points, have been studied in Chua's circuit [21,22], Lorenz–like equations [23,24] or models with an exponential nonlinear term [25]. A research on complicated basins of attraction and amplitude death in coupled hidden attractors can be found in Ref [26]. Many new examples of hidden oscillations have been described in Ref [27], while in Refs [28] and  [29], one can find a thorough analysis of appearance and properties of this phenomenon in different types of systems. On the other hand, rare attractors defined by Zakrzhevsky et_al [30] as the states with a very small probability of appearance compared to other solutions have been observed in driven nonlinear systems with several degrees of freedom [30], damped pendulum systems [31], discrete models [32], or van der Pol–Duffing oscillators [28,33,34].
The problem of localization of hidden or/and rare attractors motivated researchers to propose and develop new tools and methods of finding these states. One of such tools is the concept of perpetual points [28,34–40], introduced by Prasad in 2015 [35]. A note on topological conjugacy for this type of points can be found in Ref [36], while in Refs [28],  [34], and  [37], a connection between perpetual points and hidden oscillations has been studied. The generalization of the introduced concept for discrete-time systems has been presented in Ref [38], while in Refs [39] and  [40], the authors indicate some of its limitations. A recent study on the relation between perpetual points and localization of co–existing attractors can be found in Ref [37].
As it has been shown [28,34,35,37,38], perpetual points can be used to analyze the problem of chaotic motion. Very recently, a new type of specific points in phase space, called as regular points, has been described. Just like perpetual points, they arised from the generalization of well–known stationary states. Regular points have been introduced by Letellier and Malasoma [41] and defined as points in which derivatives of a specific number of dynamical variables become zero (depending on the degree of regular point), while the rest remain nonzero and have been used to study the architecture of chaotic flows and their properties. In Ref [41], one can find many interesting and convincing examples on this problem.
Motivated by the study of Letellier and Malasoma, we have found natural connections between regular and perpetual points, showing the usefulness of both types of concepts in the description of chaotic attractors.
Our results in this paper are ordered as follows: in Sec. II, we shortly introduce the ideas of regular and perpetual points and the notation used in further considerations. In Sec. III, we study the connection between chaotic states and described tools, considering many different types of systems. A statistical analysis of reaching desired attractors with the application of perpetual points is investigated in Sec. IV. Finally, in Sec. V, general conclusions and remarks are discussed.
II. BASIC CONCEPTS AND NOTATION
In this work, we focus only on three–dimensional dynamical systems, hence without loss of generality, all the concepts and notation will be restricted only to such a case. An extension to models in lower/higher dimensions is natural, and hence not presented here.
Let us consider a general 3D system, given by the following equations:
where (x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}) denotes the vector of dynamical variables, while functions f_{1},f_{2},f_{3} describe the dynamics. Let U⊂ℝ^{3} be the phase space of considered system (1).
According to Letellier and Malasoma [41], an m–regular point, where m∈{0,1,2,3} [due to the dimension of system (1)] is defined as the point in phase space in which derivatives of exactly m variables are nonzero. Moreover, depending on the chosen variables, one can calculate the partition of the set of m–regular points.
In our study, we have used the following notation. Let R^{m} be the set of m–regular points.
We have the following possibilities:
It should be emphasized that in the case of R^{1} and R^{2} sets (1– and 2–regular points sets, respectively), corresponding parts of the partition are pairwise disjoint (e.g., Rx_{i}1∩Rx_{j}1=∅fori≠j). Moreover, the whole phase space U can be expressed using sets of regular points, i.e., U=∪m=03R^{m}, where R^{m1}∩R^{m2}=∅form_{1}≠m_{2}. An illustration of this fact is shown in Fig. 1.
The phase space U⊂ℝ^{3} of system (1) is presented in Fig. 1 as a cube, while the set of stationary points (here single one), which is equivalent to R^{0} is shown in green. For a better clarity, in Fig. 1 we have denoted only single parts of 1– and 2–regular points sets. Hence, the Rx_{i}1 and Rx_{i}x_{j}2 are marked by red and green colors, respectively, while i, j correspond to indices of the chosen dynamical variables. On the other hand, the R^{3} set is left as the blank space.
As can be seen in Fig. 1, the sets of regular points in some sense complement each other while filling the phase space, e.g., set R^{0} (here point) denotes the discontinuity of all curves of which Rx_{i}1 sets are made. On the other hand, sets Rx_{i}x_{j}2 split space U by planes, in consequence leaving only the set R^{3}.
The case shown in Fig. 1 is the most representative one and has been observed in our research, i.e., the dimension of R^{m} set equals m [e.g., R^{0} is made of single points (depending on the number of equilibria), R^{1} consists of curves, etc.]. However, it should be noted that one can easily construct a system for which other possibilities may also appear.
As it has been shown, regular points determine a new way of partition of dynamical phase space. This fact can be closely related with their ability to characterize the shape of attractors, which has been presented in Sec. III.
The second type of points, which are in the scope of interest of this paper, are the perpetual points (PPs). For system (1), the set of this type of points can be simply defined as
Hence, in the perpetual point, the acceleration vector of dynamical variables equals zero, while the velocity of at least one of variables is nonzero (i.e., we exclude fixed points—the second condition in definition of set P). Depending on the number of zero derivatives, the perpetual point can belong to any set of regular points, except the R^{0} one. In our investigations, we have observed a variety of possibilities and relations between these two types of points, which are discussed in the following Sec. III.
III. REGULAR AND PERPETUAL POINTS IN DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS
In this section, we present the analysis of regular and perpetual points in different types of dynamical systems. Our investigations include all possible types of relations between the considered tools. We study the cases when:
(i) PPs belong to the R^{1} set (Wang and Chen system),
(ii) PPs belong to the R^{2} set (Wei system), and
(iii)  PPs belong to the R^{3} set (Rössler system).
Moreover, we also analyze two non–autonomous mechanical oscillators: Duffing and van der Pol–Duffing ones, for which more complex relations can be observed.
A. Wang and Chen system
At first, let us consider the Wang and Chen system [42], given by equations
where α<0 is the parameter. It can be easily shown that model (2) does not have any fixed point, but exhibits hidden, chaotic oscillations as shown in Fig. 2.
Flow (2) possesses two perpetual points, i.e., PP1=(0,(1+1−12α)/6,0) and PP2=(0,(1−1−12α)/6,0). Since the velocity of 2nd and 3rd variables of the considered system becomes zero at both perpetual points (ẏ=ż=0 calculated for PP1 and PP2), then PP1, PP2 ∈Rx1⊂R^{1}. On the other hand, set Rx1 is given by the following relations:
Our analysis of system (2) for parameter α=−0.05 is shown in Fig. 2. The chaotic attractor is marked in a black line, while perpetual points and Rx1 set are denoted by blue dots and red curves, respectively. The projections of all structures are presented on different planes, i.e., (x, y) in Fig. 2(a) and (y, z) in Fig. 2(b).
As one can see, 1–regular points nicely correlate with the shape of the existing attractor. In Fig. 2(a), the position of red curves for x > 0 is close to the boundaries of the flow, while in Fig. 2(b), the points denote a kind of critical line across the state in z intersection. Indeed, when the trajectory reaches one of the red lines (except the small interval of y values between PP1 and PP2 points), the flow in the y direction changes, beginning to increase or decrease (i.e., the sign of ẏ changes). These kinds of relations between regular points and architecture of attractors have been observed on many examples and thoroughly discussed in Ref [41].
On the other hand, perpetual points of system (2) lie exactly in the extrema of red lines [Fig. 2(a)]. As can be observed in Fig. 2(b), 1–regular points emerge from the perpetual ones. Moreover, point PP1 can be used as the initial condition in order to locate the hidden attractor (trajectory starting from PP2 escapes to infinity).
According to Ref [41], for a given set of 1–regular points, a stability analysis in a two-dimensional subspace of ℝ^{3} can be performed. Indeed, let us consider the Rx1 set given by relations (3). If (x^{*},y^{*},z^{*})∈Rx1, then ẏ{*}=ż{*}=0, so (x^{*},y^{*},z^{*}) can be treated as a fixed point in (y, z) plane subspace. Hence, the linearization around this point can be studied.
The characteristic equation of system (2) reduced to the (y, z) plane is given by the formula λ^{2}+λx+(1−6y)=0, with corresponding eigenvalues λ_{1,2}=(−x±x^{2}−4(1−6y))/2. Consequently, points from the upper branch of the Rx1 set [red curve for y > 0 in Fig. 2(a)] have two real eigenvalues, while points from the lower part complex–conjugate ones. According to perpetual points, PP1 is associated with two real eigenvalues of opposite sign, namely λ_{1,2}=±1.12468. Hence, this point denotes the saddle of the linearized system. On the other hand, eigenvalues at PP2 equal λ_{1,2}=±1.12468i (pure imaginary ones) and refer to the center equilibrium.
The relation between type of eigenvalues and the property of localizing attractors by perpetual points does not seem to be coincidental. In the considered case, PP1 (which traces the solution) is located in the saddle, while eigenvalues of point PP2 leading to infinity are complex–conjugate. This type of correlation has been observed in our study also for different systems, which are discussed further.
B. Wei system
As the second example, let us consider the Wei system [43], defined as
where a and b are the parameters. In our investigations, we have fixed b = 2 and considered a as the control parameter. It should be noted that for a > 0, system (4) does not have any equilibria, but the previous example (2) exhibits hidden, chaotic oscillations as shown in Fig. 3.
Flow (4) has two perpetual points, i.e., PP1=(0,(1+1+4ab)/2b,0) and PP2=(0,(1−1+4ab)/2b,0). Both points belong to the Rxz2 subset of the 2–regular point set, since the value of derivative ẏ in them equals zero. On the other hand, set Rxz2 is given by the following relations:
The results of numerical calculations for a = 0.35 are presented in Fig. 3. In Fig. 3(a), the projections of chaotic solution (black), perpetual points (blue dots), and Rxz2 set (red curve) on the (x, z) plane are shown. As one can see, the plane Rxz2 is perpendicular to the xz one (the projection is a straight, one–dimensional line). Moreover, the attractor somewhat rotates around the considered set, which can be observed in the relation between the red and black curves in Fig. 3(a). In this example, since for both perpetual points x=z=0, PP1 and PP2 overlap.
In the case of Wei system (4), we have also examined the 1–regular point subsets, similar to the analysis performed in Ref [41]. Projections of chaotic state, perpetual points, Rx1, and Ry1,Rz1 sets are marked in Fig. 3(b) by black, blue, red, and violet colors, respectively. The curves created by points from Rx1 nicely follow the rotational character of the attractor, while Ry1,Rz1 sets (overlapping) determine the boundary at y = 0, which separates branches of the Rx1 one. On the other hand, the position of perpetual points seems to be closely related with the described 1–regular point subsets. Indeed, point PP1 is in some sense surrounded by the right part of Rx1 (for y > 0), while PP2 is closer to the second one (left red curve). Additionally, both points are split by Ry1,Rz1.
The last observations have been especially taken into account during the stability analysis of system (4) on the (y, z) plane. In this subspace, the characteristic equation λ^{2}−λx−2by=0 has two solutions λ_{1,2}=(x±x^{2}+8by)/2. According to Ref [41], the right branch of Rx1 in Fig. 3(b) corresponds to the real eigenvalues, while the left one to the complex-conjugate ones. A similar relation occurs for perpetual points, namely at PP1 λ_{1,2}=±1.71737, while at PP2 λ_{1,2}=±0.97435i. Simultaneously, PP1 leads to the hidden, chaotic solution, while the trajectory starting from PP2 escapes to infinity. As it can be noticed, although PPs are 2-regular points instead of 1-regular ones, in this case, their relation with eigenvalues is strictly the same as for the Wang and Chen system (2).
C. Rössler system
In another example, we consider celebrated chaotic flow, i.e., the Rössler system [44,45], given by dynamical equations
where a, b, and c are the parameters. In our calculations, we have used typical values of a=0.2,b=0.2,c=5.7, for which the system has two fixed points FP1=(0.00703,−0.03513,0.03513), FP2=(5.69297,−28.4649,28.4649), two perpetual points PP1=(7.03568,8.42241,−6.67838), PP2=(4.78099,−3.79047,4.59505) and possesses the chaotic attractor, which is self-excited since it can be located using the unstable equilibrium FP1.
In the case of Rössler system (6), all derivatives at perpetual points are nonzero, hence PPs belong to the R^{3} set of 3–regular points. Because of the lack of clarity (R^{3} is a three–dimensional set which fulfills almost all the phase space), in our investigations, we have focused on relations between the attractor, perpetual points, and 1–regular point subsets Rx1,Ry1,Rz1. The results are presented in Fig. 4.
As one can see, the chaotic attractor (black) lies on the curves of Rx1,Ry1 sets (red ones). What is more, the peaks of the trajectory, which are reached in the z direction are placed exactly on the vertical part of the red curve. On the other hand, in the discontinuity of Rx1(Ry1) and Rz1, one can observe the R^{0} set (only one fixed point is shown due to the boundaries of the Figure), which results from the definition of the regular points concept.
Two perpetual points co-existing for the Rössler system (6) are marked in Fig. 4 by blue dots. As one can notice, the location of these points is similar to the one observed for the Wei system (4) considered in the previous example. Here, point PP1 is surrounded by the lower part of the red curve (x>c=5.7), while PP2 is surrounded by the upper one (x<c=5.7).
Although the basin of attraction of the Rössler attractor is the dominating region in phase space (about 98.2% of initial conditions chosen from the box containing the stable solution lead to it), an instability can be also observed, when the trajectories escape to infinity. In order to study the localization properties of PPs, we have performed a stability analysis for Rx1 and Ry1 sets, whose results are as follows. The characteristic equation related with Rx1 [(y, z) subspace] is given by the formula (a−λ)(x−c−λ)=0, with corresponding eigenvalues λ_{1}=a and λ_{2}=x−c. At PP1, λ_{1,PP1}=0.2,λ_{2,PP1}=1.33568, while at PP2 λ_{1,PP2}=0.2,λ_{2,PP2}=−0.91901. Hence, for Rx1, point PP2 is related with the saddle. On the other hand, the equation for Ry1 [(x, z) subspace] is −λ(x−c−λ)+z=0 and has two solutions λ_{1,2}=((x−c)±(x−c){2}−4z)/2. The values at perpetual points are as follows: λ_{1,PP1}=3.33699,λ_{2,PP1}=−2.00132 and λ_{1,PP2}=−0.4595+2.09378i,λ_{2,PP2}=−0.4595−2.09378i. Hence, in this case, PP1 has two real eigenvalues of opposite sign. The “saddle property” of both perpetual points (observed for different subsets of R^{1} for each point) coincide with their localizing application, i.e., trajectories starting from PP1 and PP2 get attracted by the chaotic state. Moreover, in this matter, one can notice that PPs have an advantage over fixed points since only FP1 can be used to locate the attractor (equilibrium FP2 lies in the instability region and leads to infinity).
D. Mechanical oscillators
The concepts of regular and perpetual points, originally introduced for autonomous differential equations can be easily generalized into non-autonomous systems, e.g., excited mechanical oscillators, which are discussed in this subsection.
First, we have studied the Duffing oscillator [2,46], which is externally excited by periodic force. The dynamics of this model is described as follows:
where x and y describe the position and velocity of the system, respectively, while z is the time variable. System (7) is presented in the form of 1st order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for simplicity and can be easily transformed into the standard 2nd order dynamical equation. Here, we fix the parameters' values at δ=0.2,α=−1,β=1,γ=0.3, and ω = 1 for which the system exhibits typical chaotic oscillations.
As we have shown in Ref [34], in the case of non–autonomous systems, one can observe infinitely many perpetual points, since the second derivative of the 3rd equation in (7) is identically equal to zero. Hence, we obtain two equations with three variables, which can be solved using different values of time z (perpetual points are calculated on the consecutive intersections of the phase space for z∈[0,T), where T=2π/ω is the basic period of excitation).
On the other hand, since in the 3rd equation in (7) the derivative always equals 1, then the whole 1–regular points set is equal to its z part, i.e., R^{1}=Rz1, while Rx1=Ry1=∅. The relations describing Rz1 are as follows:
Likewise, in the case of perpetual points, in (8) we obtain more variables (three) than equations (two) and the solution can be calculated for varied time z. Moreover, it can be easily shown that when z=(π/2)/ω or z=(3π/2)/ω, perpetual points equal 1–regular points, i.e., in these two peculiar values of time z sets Rz1 and P (set of all PPs) intersect.
The results of the numerical study for system (7) are shown in Fig. 5. The projections on the (x, y) plane of chaotic trajectory (black), Rz1 set of 1–regular points (red), and P set of perpetual points (blue) are shown in Fig. 5(a). As one can see, both Rz1 and P curves nicely fit to the shape of the presented attractor. 1–regular points (red) lie on the y = 0 axis, which splits the state into two, almost symmetric parts. Moreover, they are surrounded by the closed curves (blue) of perpetual points. Additionally, the latter curves are located in very peculiar parts of the attractor, i.e., around its origin (0, 0) and close to two foci (attractor has elliptical shape). The enlargement around the left focus is presented in Fig. 5(b). The points at which red and blue curves intersect refer to z=(π/2)/ω and z=(3π/2)/ω values of time.
As we have shown, in the case of Duffing system (7), perpetual points even more likely describe the shape and structure of the chaotic state than regular points. Similar observation has been found for the second studied oscillator, i.e., the forced van der Pol–Duffing one [33,34]. Its equations of motion are given as follows:
where variables x, y, and z describe the position, velocity, and time, respectively, while α,F and ω are system's parameters fixed at α=0.2,F=1,ω=0.998.
Model (9) can exhibit high multistability [33,34]. In the investigated case, it possesses three co-existing attractors, namely one periodic and two chaotic, whose basins of attraction with corresponding Poincare sections are presented in Fig. 6(a). As one can see, the period–1 state (brown dot with gray basin) co-exists with chaotic states shown as blue/yellow dots on the red/green basin (strange attractors are symmetric to each other).
As in the case of Duffing system (7), both perpetual and regular points can be calculated for a varied value of time z∈[0,2π/ω) (there is infinitely many PPs and only one subset of 1–regular points set, i.e., Rz1). The projections on (x, y) of one of the chaotic trajectories (black), Rz1 (red) and P (blue) sets are presented in Figs. 6(b) and 6(c). As one can observe, 1–regular points are located on the y = 0 line around which the attractor rotates. On the other hand, a set of perpetual points surrounds the Rz1 set. Moreover, the right part of P denotes the border of oscillations, which can be more clearly observed in the enlargement in Fig. 6(c)—the trajectory is limited by the blue curve. Additionally, as it has been observed for the Wang and Chen system (2), when the oscillator reaches the red line, it begins to move in the opposite direction (the sign of ẋ=y changes). Likewise, this type of behavior has been found in the previously discussed Duffing model (7) [see Fig. 5(b)], but not in such a clear way.
The results obtained for the attractor studied in Figs. 6(b) and 6(c) have been also confirmed for the second co-existing chaotic state. Moreover, the observed relations between regular/perpetual points and non–autonomous systems (e.g., infinite number of PPs, intersections of R^{1} and P sets) seem to be general, as they do not depend on the dynamical structure of the considered models.
IV. LOCALIZATION OF CHAOTIC ATTRACTORS
Along with the increase of interest in multistable systems having many co–existing attractors, the problem of their localization arised. Apart from the trivial case of self–excited states which can be traced using unstable equilibria, if some of the attractors are hidden or rare, their detection becomes not straightforward. In previous papers [28,34,35,37,38], we have stated that perpetual points can be used as a tool for solving this problem, as they successfully localize stable states in many examples of dynamical systems. Here, motivated by the observed patterns of relations between perpetual and regular points, we enhance our study by analyzing the effectiveness of PPs in finding chaotic states.
A. Typical chaotic flows
As we have shown in Secs. III A and III B, the Wang and Chen (2) and Wei (4) systems are typical chaotic flows possessing hidden attractors. This type of states can be observed not only for the parameters fixed as in the considerations presented above (α=−0.05,a=0.35), but also for a wider range of values. Depending on these coefficients, the size of the basin of attraction of the desired solution may vary, changing the probability of its detection from the arbitrarily chosen initial conditions. The problem of localization of attractors from random initial values is closely related with the basin stability approach and has been widely discussed in Refs [47–49].
In our study, we have compared the probability of reaching Wang and Chen and Wei hidden attractors using a typical approach of random initial conditions and the tool of perpetual points. The obtained results are presented in Fig. 7.
The probability of reaching the hidden attractor when initial values are arbitrarily chosen from a 3D box containing chaotic trajectory [i.e., initial conditions (x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})∈[−1,6]×[−4,3]×[−6,3] and (x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})∈[−6,2]×[−4,3]×[−1,5] for Wang and Chen (2) and Wei (4) systems, respectively] has been marked by the red curve, while the efficiency of perpetual point PP1 [see Secs. II A and II B for details] has been denoted by blue dots. In the latter case, only the points corresponding to probability equals 1 have been included, while the jumps between probability=0,1 and vice–versa have been denoted by vertical, green lines.
As one can see in Fig. 7(a), for the Wang and Chen system (2), for the smallest values of parameter around α=−1.3, the hidden attractor is almost impossible to find from both random initial conditions and PP1. Then, along with the increase of α, the probability starts to slowly increase (although it is rather small). However, a sudden jump for the perpetual point can be identified around α=−1.14 as it locates the desired state. With further increase of α, one can observe that PP1 is effective apart from very short intervals of parameter's value (jumps around α=−0.74). Then, at α=−0.715, the attractor disappears and can be again observed when α>−0.09 (also a small peak around α=−0.1275 appears), while the probability for PP1 again reaches 1 at α=−0.075.
On the other hand, for the Wei model (4), one can notice in Fig. 7(b) that with the increase of a > 0, the probability of observing chaotic behavior decreases. Simultaneously, it can be located using PP1 along the long interval of parameter's value. Then, when a = 0.44, the perpetual point becomes useless and very soon the stable state disappears (around a = 0.485). An appearance of chaotic attractor can be again identified for a > 1.38, with almost simultaneous jump of probability for the perpetual point at a = 1.385. PP1 works until a < 1.765, for which value also the chance of finding a attractor from random conditions becomes very small and slowly converges to zero.
In both examples discussed above, the ability of the perpetual point to locate the attractor appears almost simultaneously with the increase of probability for random initial conditions above zero. In other words, when we reach the interval of parameter's value, for which the attractor is possible (or not almost impossible) to find, point PP1 localizes it. Moreover, perpetual points can have a major advantage over random conditions when the attractor is possible to observe, but very hard to find randomly. As it has been shown in Fig. 7, for some parameters' probability of reaching the desired state can be extremely small, while PP1 (when useful) localizes the state precisely, i.e., requires only one trial.
B. Semiconductor superlattices
As we have shown for Wang and Chen (2) and Wei (4) systems in Sec. IV A, the problem of localization of chaotic attractors can become nontrivial due to the existence of instability region in the phase space. With increase of the size of this region, the probability of reaching the desired state from random conditions can dramatically decrease.
The problem becomes even more crucial when one considers a multistable system with many attractors, while only one of them is essential and desired for practical applications. For example, in Ref [50], Ying et_al studied a multistable semiconductor superlattice, for which both periodic and chaotic behaviors co–exist. Quoting paper [50], “Since, in general, chaotic systems can be used as random number generators […], the ubiquity of chaos in semiconductor superlattices implies that such systems may be exploited for random signal generation in the frequency range corresponding to the THz gap.” In this subsection, we discuss the model investigated by Ying et_al and show the advantage of perpetual points over the standard method of random initial conditions in finding the desired chaotic states.
Let us consider a dimensionless model of semiconductor superlattice [50], whose dynamics is given by the following equations:
where x, y, and z are dynamical variables, while a_{0},a_{1},a_{3},b_{1},b_{2},b_{3},Ω are system's parameters. In our study, we have fixed a_{3}=7.48,b_{1}=0.28,b_{2}=0.0285,b_{3}=0.0285,Ω=1.34, and considered a_{0}, a_{1} as the control parameters. System (10) is given in the dimensionless form and the details on the physical meaning of corresponding variables and parameters can be found in Ref [50].
Results of our investigations on model (10) are shown in Fig. 8. In Fig. 8(a), the bifurcation diagram (for variable x) of potential behavior of system (10) for varied parameter a_{1}∈[1.5,2.5] and fixed a_{0}=2.23 is presented. Beginning from a_{1}=1.5, two trials (black and red points) have been examined for different initial conditions. As can be observed, for a_{1}∈[1.5,2.342] period–1 orbit (red) exists, along with a series of transitions between periodic and chaotic attractors (black). One can see that apart from parameter's regions where only regular behavior is possible (with different periods), also the co–existence between chaos and periodicity is possible. For a_{1}>2.342, both trajectories get attracted by the same state (red and black points overlap).
To investigate the probability of reaching the desired chaotic state, we have performed a statistical analysis for two varied parameters a_{0} and a_{1}. In Fig. 8(b), the results for a_{1}∈[1.5,2.5] and fixed a_{0}=2.23 are presented, while in Fig. 8(c), calculations for a_{0}∈[0.4,2.2] and fixed a_{1}=2.13 are shown. In both diagrams, Figs. 8(b) and 8(c), the probability of reaching the chaotic state is calculated using two methods: (i) random initial conditions chosen from the box (x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})∈[−1,1]{3} (the same region as proposed in Ref [50]) which is marked by red dots (dashed line) and (ii) perpetual points (infinitely many due to excitation of the system), denoted by blue ones (solid line). As one can see, for the vast majority of parameter values, results obtained using PPs are much greater. Moreover, for some parameters, perpetual points localize the attractor almost perfectly, with the probability very close to 1 [e.g., in Fig. 8(b) for a_{1}∈[2.18,2.42]]. One can compare the results from Figs. 8(b) and 8(c) with the ones included by Ying et_al in Ref [50].
It should be noted that the method of perpetual points is not perfect and not always guarantees obtaining a proper solution (e.g., in Fig. 7, where for some parameters PPs do not detect the attractor). However, because of their simplicity and ease of use, perpetual points become an elegant tool, whose efficiency can be at least tried during study on the problem of localizing hard traceable states.
V. CONCLUSIONS
The concepts of regular and perpetual points are very new and still not fully understood in the dynamical systems theory. However, as we have shown in this paper, their usefulness in the analysis of complex dynamics is high and convincing. Both types of points can be used to describe the structure and follow the motion of chaotic attractors, as their location in phase space well fit the most peculiar parts of the studied trajectories. Moreover, perpetual points can be effectively used to trace the desired attractors, since in many cases, their efficiency is much better than standard methods (e.g., random initial conditions). This property may be closely related with the stability analysis around these points, since in all considered examples where perpetual points lead to attractors, they are strictly connected with the saddle points in appropriate subspaces. The localization problem becomes even more essential in the case of multistability, where only a specific response from the system is desired. However, it should be noted that the concept of perpetual points is not sufficient for finding hidden (or unpredictable) attractors and for some systems other methods have to be applied (e.g., effective numerical search [28,51], or basin stability method [20]). As we have shown, regular and perpetual points can be observed in many different types of systems, including artificial chaotic flows, mechanical oscillators, or semiconductor superlattices. All our results indicate that the nature of appearance of the considered concepts is universal, as they can be found in various dynamical models.
Chaotic behavior, known as one of the most fundamental type of motion observed in nature, has a long history and represents an essential part of the theory of dynamical systems. Although its properties and appearance have been confirmed in many different types of models, it is nowadays still closely studied and applied in problems from various areas of science. One of the phenomenon that arised on the field of unpredictable motion is the property of multistability of systems, which is identified as the ability of possessing many co-existing attractors. Multistability becomes essential along with the increase of the number of possible solutions, as well as the appearance of less predictable states like hidden or rare oscillations. In these cases, the description, or even localization of the desired final attractor becomes complex and nontrivial. Among many methods of analysis of such problems, in this paper, we focus on two simple tools, which have been introduced as generalizations of well-known equilibria, i.e., regular and perpetual points (PPs). We expand the concept of regular points introduced by Letellier and Malasoma and indicate their relation with perpetual ones, showing the potential of both in describing chaotic motion. Moreover, we motivate the property of perpetual points in finding unpredictable states. We show the universality of appearance and use of studied tools for different types of models.
The scientific description of chaotic behavior, proposed by Edward N. Lorenz during his studies on the weather models in the 1960s, has been one of the most important moments in the history of development of the dynamical systems theory. For the first time, theoretically unpredictable and uncommon type of motion has been presented in an elegant mathematical sense. Since then, many great studies on chaotic dynamics have been published [1–5] and this peculiar type of behavior is nowadays observed in various areas of science, just to mention physics [6], chemistry [7], biology [8,9], or economy [10].
One of the most interesting phenomenon connected with complex dynamics, which is recently thoroughly studied by researchers, is the multistability property of systems, i.e., possession of many, co–existing attractors [11–20]. This type of behavior has been found in vibro–impact systems [11], stochastic oscillators [12,13], models induced by weak periodic perturbations [14], or networks of weakly coupled units [15]. The nature of attractors' basins in multistable systems has been studied in Refs [16] and  [20], while in Refs [17] and  [18], the problem of control of multistability is analyzed. On the other hand, in Ref [19], the authors investigate how to obtain extreme multistability in coupled dynamical models.
The problem of multistability is closely related with hidden [21–29] and rare [28,30–34] attractors, which can appear in a unpredictable way in system's dynamics. The former ones, which are defined as the states that cannot be traced using unstable fixed points, have been studied in Chua's circuit [21,22], Lorenz–like equations [23,24] or models with an exponential nonlinear term [25]. A research on complicated basins of attraction and amplitude death in coupled hidden attractors can be found in Ref [26]. Many new examples of hidden oscillations have been described in Ref [27], while in Refs [28] and  [29], one can find a thorough analysis of appearance and properties of this phenomenon in different types of systems. On the other hand, rare attractors defined by Zakrzhevsky et_al [30] as the states with a very small probability of appearance compared to other solutions have been observed in driven nonlinear systems with several degrees of freedom [30], damped pendulum systems [31], discrete models [32], or van der Pol–Duffing oscillators [28,33,34].
The problem of localization of hidden or/and rare attractors motivated researchers to propose and develop new tools and methods of finding these states. One of such tools is the concept of perpetual points [28,34–40], introduced by Prasad in 2015 [35]. A note on topological conjugacy for this type of points can be found in Ref [36], while in Refs [28],  [34], and  [37], a connection between perpetual points and hidden oscillations has been studied. The generalization of the introduced concept for discrete-time systems has been presented in Ref [38], while in Refs [39] and  [40], the authors indicate some of its limitations. A recent study on the relation between perpetual points and localization of co–existing attractors can be found in Ref [37].
As it has been shown [28,34,35,37,38], perpetual points can be used to analyze the problem of chaotic motion. Very recently, a new type of specific points in phase space, called as regular points, has been described. Just like perpetual points, they arised from the generalization of well–known stationary states. Regular points have been introduced by Letellier and Malasoma [41] and defined as points in which derivatives of a specific number of dynamical variables become zero (depending on the degree of regular point), while the rest remain nonzero and have been used to study the architecture of chaotic flows and their properties. In Ref [41], one can find many interesting and convincing examples on this problem.
Motivated by the study of Letellier and Malasoma, we have found natural connections between regular and perpetual points, showing the usefulness of both types of concepts in the description of chaotic attractors.
Our results in this paper are ordered as follows: in Sec. II, we shortly introduce the ideas of regular and perpetual points and the notation used in further considerations. In Sec. III, we study the connection between chaotic states and described tools, considering many different types of systems. A statistical analysis of reaching desired attractors with the application of perpetual points is investigated in Sec. IV. Finally, in Sec. V, general conclusions and remarks are discussed.
In this work, we focus only on three–dimensional dynamical systems, hence without loss of generality, all the concepts and notation will be restricted only to such a case. An extension to models in lower/higher dimensions is natural, and hence not presented here.
Let us consider a general 3D system, given by the following equations:
where (x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}) denotes the vector of dynamical variables, while functions f_{1},f_{2},f_{3} describe the dynamics. Let U⊂ℝ^{3} be the phase space of considered system (1).
According to Letellier and Malasoma [41], an m–regular point, where m∈{0,1,2,3} [due to the dimension of system (1)] is defined as the point in phase space in which derivatives of exactly m variables are nonzero. Moreover, depending on the chosen variables, one can calculate the partition of the set of m–regular points.
In our study, we have used the following notation. Let R^{m} be the set of m–regular points.
We have the following possibilities:
It should be emphasized that in the case of R^{1} and R^{2} sets (1– and 2–regular points sets, respectively), corresponding parts of the partition are pairwise disjoint (e.g., Rx_{i}1∩Rx_{j}1=∅fori≠j). Moreover, the whole phase space U can be expressed using sets of regular points, i.e., U=∪m=03R^{m}, where R^{m1}∩R^{m2}=∅form_{1}≠m_{2}. An illustration of this fact is shown in Fig. 1.
The phase space U⊂ℝ^{3} of system (1) is presented in Fig. 1 as a cube, while the set of stationary points (here single one), which is equivalent to R^{0} is shown in green. For a better clarity, in Fig. 1 we have denoted only single parts of 1– and 2–regular points sets. Hence, the Rx_{i}1 and Rx_{i}x_{j}2 are marked by red and green colors, respectively, while i, j correspond to indices of the chosen dynamical variables. On the other hand, the R^{3} set is left as the blank space.
As can be seen in Fig. 1, the sets of regular points in some sense complement each other while filling the phase space, e.g., set R^{0} (here point) denotes the discontinuity of all curves of which Rx_{i}1 sets are made. On the other hand, sets Rx_{i}x_{j}2 split space U by planes, in consequence leaving only the set R^{3}.
The case shown in Fig. 1 is the most representative one and has been observed in our research, i.e., the dimension of R^{m} set equals m [e.g., R^{0} is made of single points (depending on the number of equilibria), R^{1} consists of curves, etc.]. However, it should be noted that one can easily construct a system for which other possibilities may also appear.
As it has been shown, regular points determine a new way of partition of dynamical phase space. This fact can be closely related with their ability to characterize the shape of attractors, which has been presented in Sec. III.
The second type of points, which are in the scope of interest of this paper, are the perpetual points (PPs). For system (1), the set of this type of points can be simply defined as
Hence, in the perpetual point, the acceleration vector of dynamical variables equals zero, while the velocity of at least one of variables is nonzero (i.e., we exclude fixed points—the second condition in definition of set P). Depending on the number of zero derivatives, the perpetual point can belong to any set of regular points, except the R^{0} one. In our investigations, we have observed a variety of possibilities and relations between these two types of points, which are discussed in the following Sec. III.
In this section, we present the analysis of regular and perpetual points in different types of dynamical systems. Our investigations include all possible types of relations between the considered tools. We study the cases when:
(i) PPs belong to the R^{1} set (Wang and Chen system),
(ii) PPs belong to the R^{2} set (Wei system), and
(iii)  PPs belong to the R^{3} set (Rössler system).
PPs belong to the R^{1} set (Wang and Chen system),
PPs belong to the R^{2} set (Wei system), and
 PPs belong to the R^{3} set (Rössler system).
Moreover, we also analyze two non–autonomous mechanical oscillators: Duffing and van der Pol–Duffing ones, for which more complex relations can be observed.
At first, let us consider the Wang and Chen system [42], given by equations
where α<0 is the parameter. It can be easily shown that model (2) does not have any fixed point, but exhibits hidden, chaotic oscillations as shown in Fig. 2.
Flow (2) possesses two perpetual points, i.e., PP1=(0,(1+1−12α)/6,0) and PP2=(0,(1−1−12α)/6,0). Since the velocity of 2nd and 3rd variables of the considered system becomes zero at both perpetual points (ẏ=ż=0 calculated for PP1 and PP2), then PP1, PP2 ∈Rx1⊂R^{1}. On the other hand, set Rx1 is given by the following relations:
Our analysis of system (2) for parameter α=−0.05 is shown in Fig. 2. The chaotic attractor is marked in a black line, while perpetual points and Rx1 set are denoted by blue dots and red curves, respectively. The projections of all structures are presented on different planes, i.e., (x, y) in Fig. 2(a) and (y, z) in Fig. 2(b).
As one can see, 1–regular points nicely correlate with the shape of the existing attractor. In Fig. 2(a), the position of red curves for x > 0 is close to the boundaries of the flow, while in Fig. 2(b), the points denote a kind of critical line across the state in z intersection. Indeed, when the trajectory reaches one of the red lines (except the small interval of y values between PP1 and PP2 points), the flow in the y direction changes, beginning to increase or decrease (i.e., the sign of ẏ changes). These kinds of relations between regular points and architecture of attractors have been observed on many examples and thoroughly discussed in Ref [41].
On the other hand, perpetual points of system (2) lie exactly in the extrema of red lines [Fig. 2(a)]. As can be observed in Fig. 2(b), 1–regular points emerge from the perpetual ones. Moreover, point PP1 can be used as the initial condition in order to locate the hidden attractor (trajectory starting from PP2 escapes to infinity).
According to Ref [41], for a given set of 1–regular points, a stability analysis in a two-dimensional subspace of ℝ^{3} can be performed. Indeed, let us consider the Rx1 set given by relations (3). If (x^{*},y^{*},z^{*})∈Rx1, then ẏ{*}=ż{*}=0, so (x^{*},y^{*},z^{*}) can be treated as a fixed point in (y, z) plane subspace. Hence, the linearization around this point can be studied.
The characteristic equation of system (2) reduced to the (y, z) plane is given by the formula λ^{2}+λx+(1−6y)=0, with corresponding eigenvalues λ_{1,2}=(−x±x^{2}−4(1−6y))/2. Consequently, points from the upper branch of the Rx1 set [red curve for y > 0 in Fig. 2(a)] have two real eigenvalues, while points from the lower part complex–conjugate ones. According to perpetual points, PP1 is associated with two real eigenvalues of opposite sign, namely λ_{1,2}=±1.12468. Hence, this point denotes the saddle of the linearized system. On the other hand, eigenvalues at PP2 equal λ_{1,2}=±1.12468i (pure imaginary ones) and refer to the center equilibrium.
The relation between type of eigenvalues and the property of localizing attractors by perpetual points does not seem to be coincidental. In the considered case, PP1 (which traces the solution) is located in the saddle, while eigenvalues of point PP2 leading to infinity are complex–conjugate. This type of correlation has been observed in our study also for different systems, which are discussed further.
As the second example, let us consider the Wei system [43], defined as
where a and b are the parameters. In our investigations, we have fixed b = 2 and considered a as the control parameter. It should be noted that for a > 0, system (4) does not have any equilibria, but the previous example (2) exhibits hidden, chaotic oscillations as shown in Fig. 3.
Flow (4) has two perpetual points, i.e., PP1=(0,(1+1+4ab)/2b,0) and PP2=(0,(1−1+4ab)/2b,0). Both points belong to the Rxz2 subset of the 2–regular point set, since the value of derivative ẏ in them equals zero. On the other hand, set Rxz2 is given by the following relations:
The results of numerical calculations for a = 0.35 are presented in Fig. 3. In Fig. 3(a), the projections of chaotic solution (black), perpetual points (blue dots), and Rxz2 set (red curve) on the (x, z) plane are shown. As one can see, the plane Rxz2 is perpendicular to the xz one (the projection is a straight, one–dimensional line). Moreover, the attractor somewhat rotates around the considered set, which can be observed in the relation between the red and black curves in Fig. 3(a). In this example, since for both perpetual points x=z=0, PP1 and PP2 overlap.
In the case of Wei system (4), we have also examined the 1–regular point subsets, similar to the analysis performed in Ref [41]. Projections of chaotic state, perpetual points, Rx1, and Ry1,Rz1 sets are marked in Fig. 3(b) by black, blue, red, and violet colors, respectively. The curves created by points from Rx1 nicely follow the rotational character of the attractor, while Ry1,Rz1 sets (overlapping) determine the boundary at y = 0, which separates branches of the Rx1 one. On the other hand, the position of perpetual points seems to be closely related with the described 1–regular point subsets. Indeed, point PP1 is in some sense surrounded by the right part of Rx1 (for y > 0), while PP2 is closer to the second one (left red curve). Additionally, both points are split by Ry1,Rz1.
The last observations have been especially taken into account during the stability analysis of system (4) on the (y, z) plane. In this subspace, the characteristic equation λ^{2}−λx−2by=0 has two solutions λ_{1,2}=(x±x^{2}+8by)/2. According to Ref [41], the right branch of Rx1 in Fig. 3(b) corresponds to the real eigenvalues, while the left one to the complex-conjugate ones. A similar relation occurs for perpetual points, namely at PP1 λ_{1,2}=±1.71737, while at PP2 λ_{1,2}=±0.97435i. Simultaneously, PP1 leads to the hidden, chaotic solution, while the trajectory starting from PP2 escapes to infinity. As it can be noticed, although PPs are 2-regular points instead of 1-regular ones, in this case, their relation with eigenvalues is strictly the same as for the Wang and Chen system (2).
In another example, we consider celebrated chaotic flow, i.e., the Rössler system [44,45], given by dynamical equations
where a, b, and c are the parameters. In our calculations, we have used typical values of a=0.2,b=0.2,c=5.7, for which the system has two fixed points FP1=(0.00703,−0.03513,0.03513), FP2=(5.69297,−28.4649,28.4649), two perpetual points PP1=(7.03568,8.42241,−6.67838), PP2=(4.78099,−3.79047,4.59505) and possesses the chaotic attractor, which is self-excited since it can be located using the unstable equilibrium FP1.
In the case of Rössler system (6), all derivatives at perpetual points are nonzero, hence PPs belong to the R^{3} set of 3–regular points. Because of the lack of clarity (R^{3} is a three–dimensional set which fulfills almost all the phase space), in our investigations, we have focused on relations between the attractor, perpetual points, and 1–regular point subsets Rx1,Ry1,Rz1. The results are presented in Fig. 4.
As one can see, the chaotic attractor (black) lies on the curves of Rx1,Ry1 sets (red ones). What is more, the peaks of the trajectory, which are reached in the z direction are placed exactly on the vertical part of the red curve. On the other hand, in the discontinuity of Rx1(Ry1) and Rz1, one can observe the R^{0} set (only one fixed point is shown due to the boundaries of the Figure), which results from the definition of the regular points concept.
Two perpetual points co-existing for the Rössler system (6) are marked in Fig. 4 by blue dots. As one can notice, the location of these points is similar to the one observed for the Wei system (4) considered in the previous example. Here, point PP1 is surrounded by the lower part of the red curve (x>c=5.7), while PP2 is surrounded by the upper one (x<c=5.7).
Although the basin of attraction of the Rössler attractor is the dominating region in phase space (about 98.2% of initial conditions chosen from the box containing the stable solution lead to it), an instability can be also observed, when the trajectories escape to infinity. In order to study the localization properties of PPs, we have performed a stability analysis for Rx1 and Ry1 sets, whose results are as follows. The characteristic equation related with Rx1 [(y, z) subspace] is given by the formula (a−λ)(x−c−λ)=0, with corresponding eigenvalues λ_{1}=a and λ_{2}=x−c. At PP1, λ_{1,PP1}=0.2,λ_{2,PP1}=1.33568, while at PP2 λ_{1,PP2}=0.2,λ_{2,PP2}=−0.91901. Hence, for Rx1, point PP2 is related with the saddle. On the other hand, the equation for Ry1 [(x, z) subspace] is −λ(x−c−λ)+z=0 and has two solutions λ_{1,2}=((x−c)±(x−c){2}−4z)/2. The values at perpetual points are as follows: λ_{1,PP1}=3.33699,λ_{2,PP1}=−2.00132 and λ_{1,PP2}=−0.4595+2.09378i,λ_{2,PP2}=−0.4595−2.09378i. Hence, in this case, PP1 has two real eigenvalues of opposite sign. The “saddle property” of both perpetual points (observed for different subsets of R^{1} for each point) coincide with their localizing application, i.e., trajectories starting from PP1 and PP2 get attracted by the chaotic state. Moreover, in this matter, one can notice that PPs have an advantage over fixed points since only FP1 can be used to locate the attractor (equilibrium FP2 lies in the instability region and leads to infinity).
The concepts of regular and perpetual points, originally introduced for autonomous differential equations can be easily generalized into non-autonomous systems, e.g., excited mechanical oscillators, which are discussed in this subsection.
First, we have studied the Duffing oscillator [2,46], which is externally excited by periodic force. The dynamics of this model is described as follows:
where x and y describe the position and velocity of the system, respectively, while z is the time variable. System (7) is presented in the form of 1st order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for simplicity and can be easily transformed into the standard 2nd order dynamical equation. Here, we fix the parameters' values at δ=0.2,α=−1,β=1,γ=0.3, and ω = 1 for which the system exhibits typical chaotic oscillations.
As we have shown in Ref [34], in the case of non–autonomous systems, one can observe infinitely many perpetual points, since the second derivative of the 3rd equation in (7) is identically equal to zero. Hence, we obtain two equations with three variables, which can be solved using different values of time z (perpetual points are calculated on the consecutive intersections of the phase space for z∈[0,T), where T=2π/ω is the basic period of excitation).
On the other hand, since in the 3rd equation in (7) the derivative always equals 1, then the whole 1–regular points set is equal to its z part, i.e., R^{1}=Rz1, while Rx1=Ry1=∅. The relations describing Rz1 are as follows:
Likewise, in the case of perpetual points, in (8) we obtain more variables (three) than equations (two) and the solution can be calculated for varied time z. Moreover, it can be easily shown that when z=(π/2)/ω or z=(3π/2)/ω, perpetual points equal 1–regular points, i.e., in these two peculiar values of time z sets Rz1 and P (set of all PPs) intersect.
The results of the numerical study for system (7) are shown in Fig. 5. The projections on the (x, y) plane of chaotic trajectory (black), Rz1 set of 1–regular points (red), and P set of perpetual points (blue) are shown in Fig. 5(a). As one can see, both Rz1 and P curves nicely fit to the shape of the presented attractor. 1–regular points (red) lie on the y = 0 axis, which splits the state into two, almost symmetric parts. Moreover, they are surrounded by the closed curves (blue) of perpetual points. Additionally, the latter curves are located in very peculiar parts of the attractor, i.e., around its origin (0, 0) and close to two foci (attractor has elliptical shape). The enlargement around the left focus is presented in Fig. 5(b). The points at which red and blue curves intersect refer to z=(π/2)/ω and z=(3π/2)/ω values of time.
As we have shown, in the case of Duffing system (7), perpetual points even more likely describe the shape and structure of the chaotic state than regular points. Similar observation has been found for the second studied oscillator, i.e., the forced van der Pol–Duffing one [33,34]. Its equations of motion are given as follows:
where variables x, y, and z describe the position, velocity, and time, respectively, while α,F and ω are system's parameters fixed at α=0.2,F=1,ω=0.998.
Model (9) can exhibit high multistability [33,34]. In the investigated case, it possesses three co-existing attractors, namely one periodic and two chaotic, whose basins of attraction with corresponding Poincare sections are presented in Fig. 6(a). As one can see, the period–1 state (brown dot with gray basin) co-exists with chaotic states shown as blue/yellow dots on the red/green basin (strange attractors are symmetric to each other).
As in the case of Duffing system (7), both perpetual and regular points can be calculated for a varied value of time z∈[0,2π/ω) (there is infinitely many PPs and only one subset of 1–regular points set, i.e., Rz1). The projections on (x, y) of one of the chaotic trajectories (black), Rz1 (red) and P (blue) sets are presented in Figs. 6(b) and 6(c). As one can observe, 1–regular points are located on the y = 0 line around which the attractor rotates. On the other hand, a set of perpetual points surrounds the Rz1 set. Moreover, the right part of P denotes the border of oscillations, which can be more clearly observed in the enlargement in Fig. 6(c)—the trajectory is limited by the blue curve. Additionally, as it has been observed for the Wang and Chen system (2), when the oscillator reaches the red line, it begins to move in the opposite direction (the sign of ẋ=y changes). Likewise, this type of behavior has been found in the previously discussed Duffing model (7) [see Fig. 5(b)], but not in such a clear way.
The results obtained for the attractor studied in Figs. 6(b) and 6(c) have been also confirmed for the second co-existing chaotic state. Moreover, the observed relations between regular/perpetual points and non–autonomous systems (e.g., infinite number of PPs, intersections of R^{1} and P sets) seem to be general, as they do not depend on the dynamical structure of the considered models.
Along with the increase of interest in multistable systems having many co–existing attractors, the problem of their localization arised. Apart from the trivial case of self–excited states which can be traced using unstable equilibria, if some of the attractors are hidden or rare, their detection becomes not straightforward. In previous papers [28,34,35,37,38], we have stated that perpetual points can be used as a tool for solving this problem, as they successfully localize stable states in many examples of dynamical systems. Here, motivated by the observed patterns of relations between perpetual and regular points, we enhance our study by analyzing the effectiveness of PPs in finding chaotic states.
As we have shown in Secs. III A and III B, the Wang and Chen (2) and Wei (4) systems are typical chaotic flows possessing hidden attractors. This type of states can be observed not only for the parameters fixed as in the considerations presented above (α=−0.05,a=0.35), but also for a wider range of values. Depending on these coefficients, the size of the basin of attraction of the desired solution may vary, changing the probability of its detection from the arbitrarily chosen initial conditions. The problem of localization of attractors from random initial values is closely related with the basin stability approach and has been widely discussed in Refs [47–49].
In our study, we have compared the probability of reaching Wang and Chen and Wei hidden attractors using a typical approach of random initial conditions and the tool of perpetual points. The obtained results are presented in Fig. 7.
The probability of reaching the hidden attractor when initial values are arbitrarily chosen from a 3D box containing chaotic trajectory [i.e., initial conditions (x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})∈[−1,6]×[−4,3]×[−6,3] and (x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})∈[−6,2]×[−4,3]×[−1,5] for Wang and Chen (2) and Wei (4) systems, respectively] has been marked by the red curve, while the efficiency of perpetual point PP1 [see Secs. II A and II B for details] has been denoted by blue dots. In the latter case, only the points corresponding to probability equals 1 have been included, while the jumps between probability=0,1 and vice–versa have been denoted by vertical, green lines.
As one can see in Fig. 7(a), for the Wang and Chen system (2), for the smallest values of parameter around α=−1.3, the hidden attractor is almost impossible to find from both random initial conditions and PP1. Then, along with the increase of α, the probability starts to slowly increase (although it is rather small). However, a sudden jump for the perpetual point can be identified around α=−1.14 as it locates the desired state. With further increase of α, one can observe that PP1 is effective apart from very short intervals of parameter's value (jumps around α=−0.74). Then, at α=−0.715, the attractor disappears and can be again observed when α>−0.09 (also a small peak around α=−0.1275 appears), while the probability for PP1 again reaches 1 at α=−0.075.
On the other hand, for the Wei model (4), one can notice in Fig. 7(b) that with the increase of a > 0, the probability of observing chaotic behavior decreases. Simultaneously, it can be located using PP1 along the long interval of parameter's value. Then, when a = 0.44, the perpetual point becomes useless and very soon the stable state disappears (around a = 0.485). An appearance of chaotic attractor can be again identified for a > 1.38, with almost simultaneous jump of probability for the perpetual point at a = 1.385. PP1 works until a < 1.765, for which value also the chance of finding a attractor from random conditions becomes very small and slowly converges to zero.
In both examples discussed above, the ability of the perpetual point to locate the attractor appears almost simultaneously with the increase of probability for random initial conditions above zero. In other words, when we reach the interval of parameter's value, for which the attractor is possible (or not almost impossible) to find, point PP1 localizes it. Moreover, perpetual points can have a major advantage over random conditions when the attractor is possible to observe, but very hard to find randomly. As it has been shown in Fig. 7, for some parameters' probability of reaching the desired state can be extremely small, while PP1 (when useful) localizes the state precisely, i.e., requires only one trial.
As we have shown for Wang and Chen (2) and Wei (4) systems in Sec. IV A, the problem of localization of chaotic attractors can become nontrivial due to the existence of instability region in the phase space. With increase of the size of this region, the probability of reaching the desired state from random conditions can dramatically decrease.
The problem becomes even more crucial when one considers a multistable system with many attractors, while only one of them is essential and desired for practical applications. For example, in Ref [50], Ying et_al studied a multistable semiconductor superlattice, for which both periodic and chaotic behaviors co–exist. Quoting paper [50], “Since, in general, chaotic systems can be used as random number generators […], the ubiquity of chaos in semiconductor superlattices implies that such systems may be exploited for random signal generation in the frequency range corresponding to the THz gap.” In this subsection, we discuss the model investigated by Ying et_al and show the advantage of perpetual points over the standard method of random initial conditions in finding the desired chaotic states.
Let us consider a dimensionless model of semiconductor superlattice [50], whose dynamics is given by the following equations:
where x, y, and z are dynamical variables, while a_{0},a_{1},a_{3},b_{1},b_{2},b_{3},Ω are system's parameters. In our study, we have fixed a_{3}=7.48,b_{1}=0.28,b_{2}=0.0285,b_{3}=0.0285,Ω=1.34, and considered a_{0}, a_{1} as the control parameters. System (10) is given in the dimensionless form and the details on the physical meaning of corresponding variables and parameters can be found in Ref [50].
Results of our investigations on model (10) are shown in Fig. 8. In Fig. 8(a), the bifurcation diagram (for variable x) of potential behavior of system (10) for varied parameter a_{1}∈[1.5,2.5] and fixed a_{0}=2.23 is presented. Beginning from a_{1}=1.5, two trials (black and red points) have been examined for different initial conditions. As can be observed, for a_{1}∈[1.5,2.342] period–1 orbit (red) exists, along with a series of transitions between periodic and chaotic attractors (black). One can see that apart from parameter's regions where only regular behavior is possible (with different periods), also the co–existence between chaos and periodicity is possible. For a_{1}>2.342, both trajectories get attracted by the same state (red and black points overlap).
To investigate the probability of reaching the desired chaotic state, we have performed a statistical analysis for two varied parameters a_{0} and a_{1}. In Fig. 8(b), the results for a_{1}∈[1.5,2.5] and fixed a_{0}=2.23 are presented, while in Fig. 8(c), calculations for a_{0}∈[0.4,2.2] and fixed a_{1}=2.13 are shown. In both diagrams, Figs. 8(b) and 8(c), the probability of reaching the chaotic state is calculated using two methods: (i) random initial conditions chosen from the box (x_{0},y_{0},z_{0})∈[−1,1]{3} (the same region as proposed in Ref [50]) which is marked by red dots (dashed line) and (ii) perpetual points (infinitely many due to excitation of the system), denoted by blue ones (solid line). As one can see, for the vast majority of parameter values, results obtained using PPs are much greater. Moreover, for some parameters, perpetual points localize the attractor almost perfectly, with the probability very close to 1 [e.g., in Fig. 8(b) for a_{1}∈[2.18,2.42]]. One can compare the results from Figs. 8(b) and 8(c) with the ones included by Ying et_al in Ref [50].
It should be noted that the method of perpetual points is not perfect and not always guarantees obtaining a proper solution (e.g., in Fig. 7, where for some parameters PPs do not detect the attractor). However, because of their simplicity and ease of use, perpetual points become an elegant tool, whose efficiency can be at least tried during study on the problem of localizing hard traceable states.
The concepts of regular and perpetual points are very new and still not fully understood in the dynamical systems theory. However, as we have shown in this paper, their usefulness in the analysis of complex dynamics is high and convincing. Both types of points can be used to describe the structure and follow the motion of chaotic attractors, as their location in phase space well fit the most peculiar parts of the studied trajectories. Moreover, perpetual points can be effectively used to trace the desired attractors, since in many cases, their efficiency is much better than standard methods (e.g., random initial conditions). This property may be closely related with the stability analysis around these points, since in all considered examples where perpetual points lead to attractors, they are strictly connected with the saddle points in appropriate subspaces. The localization problem becomes even more essential in the case of multistability, where only a specific response from the system is desired. However, it should be noted that the concept of perpetual points is not sufficient for finding hidden (or unpredictable) attractors and for some systems other methods have to be applied (e.g., effective numerical search [28,51], or basin stability method [20]). As we have shown, regular and perpetual points can be observed in many different types of systems, including artificial chaotic flows, mechanical oscillators, or semiconductor superlattices. All our results indicate that the nature of appearance of the considered concepts is universal, as they can be found in various dynamical models.
