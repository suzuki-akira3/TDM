Integrable nonlinear Schrödinger system on a lattice with three structural elements in the unit cell
Developing the idea of increasing the number of structural elements in the unit cell of a quasi-one-dimensional lattice as applied to the semi-discrete integrable systems of nonlinear Schrödinger type, we construct the zero-curvature representation for the general integrable nonlinear system on a lattice with three structural elements in the unit cell. The integrability of the obtained general system permits to find explicitly a number of local conservation laws responsible for the main features of system dynamics and in particular for the so-called natural constraints separating the field variables into the basic and the concomitant ones. Thus, considering the reduction to the semi-discrete integrable system of nonlinear Schrödinger type, we revealed the essentially nontrivial impact of concomitant fields on the Poisson structure and on the whole Hamiltonian formulation of system dynamics caused by the nonzero background values of these fields. On the other hand, the zero-curvature representation of a general nonlinear system serves as an indispensable key to the dressing procedure of system integration based upon the Darboux transformation of the auxiliary linear problem and the implicit Bäcklund transformation of field variables. Due to the symmetries inherent to the six-component semi-discrete integrable nonlinear Schrödinger system with attractive-type nonlinearities, the Darboux–Bäcklund dressing scheme is shown to be simplified considerably, giving rise to the appropriately parameterized multi-component soliton solution consisting of six basic and four concomitant components.
I. INTRODUCTION
Recently it has been shown that the integrable nonlinear Schrödinger system on a quasi-one-dimensional lattice with two structural elements in the unit cell exhibits a number of nontrivial features provided the background values of its concomitant fields are essentially nonzero [28–35]. Thus, the symplectic matrix responsible for the Hamiltonian dynamics of this system turns out to be unsplittable, and as a result all basic field variables become mutually intermixed in the framework of nonstandard fundamental Poisson brackets [29,31,34,35]. On the other hand, the very system equations are proved to be critical against the main background parameter [24,30–35], and in the standardized system we observe the crossover from bright-bright nonlinear excitations to dark-bright nonlinear excitations at the critical point [31–35]. The crossover effect is clearly manifested also by the system multi-component soliton solution [31–35].
Developing the concept of background-controlled concomitant fields whose potentiality has been substantiated by the above-mentioned results, in the present article we shall consider the more complicated integrable nonlinear system settled on a lattice with three structural elements in the unit cell. Having been rather general, the extended system admits at least several reductions important for physical applications. For the sake of convenience, we shall formulate the key results related to all reduced systems in terms of the general integrable system, though for their practical realizations we shall concentrate on the six-component semi-discrete integrable nonlinear Schrödinger system characterized by the attractive-type nonlinearities.
The latter system is described by the ten differential-difference nonlinear equations
and
for the six basic ϕ_{+}(n), ϕ(n), ϕ_{−}(n), ψ_{+}(n), ψ(n), ψ_{−}(n) and four concomitant η(n), μ(n), θ(n), ν(n) fields. Here the overdot stands for the differentiation with respect to continuous time variable τ, whereas the integer n running from minus to plus infinity denotes the ordinal number of a lattice unit cell. The time-dependent parameters α and β describe the primary inter-site resonant interactions between excitations formalized by the basic field variables. The attractive-type nonlinearities of the system (1.1)–(1.10) are supported by the pairwise complex conjugations of field variables ψ_{+}(n)=ϕ+*(n), ψ(n) = ϕ^{*}(n), ψ_{−}(n)=ϕ−*(n), θ(n) = η^{*}(n), ν(n) = μ^{*}(n) accompanied by the pairwise complex conjugation of coupling parameters β = α^{*}. The separation into the basic and concomitant fields is caused by the four on-unit-cell conservation laws establishing implicit dependencies of concomitant field variables on the basic ones. Here it is necessary to stress that each unit cell of the lattice consists of three structural elements referred to as the plus-labeled, minus-labeled, and unlabeled ones. For this reason, the three pairs of basic (truly independent) field variables ϕ_{+}(n), ψ_{+}(n); ϕ_{−}(n), ψ_{−}(n); and ϕ(n), ψ(n) are labeled, respectively.
II. SEMI-DISCRETE ZERO-CURVATURE REPRESENTATION FOR THE FIRST GENERAL INTEGRABLE NONLINEAR SYSTEM FROM AN INFINITE HIERARCHY
To prove the integrability of a semi-discrete nonlinear system in the Lax sense [14], we must select two matrix-valued functions L(n|z) and A(n|z) being mutually consistent (compatible) in the framework of semi-discrete zero-curvature relation [17]
where the spectral parameter z is regarded as the time-independent one.
While dealing with the general integrable nonlinear system admitting the reduction to the integrable nonlinear Schrödinger system on a lattice with three structural elements in the unit cell (1.1)–(1.10), the auxiliary spectral L(n|z) and evolution A(n|z) operators should be chosen as 2 × 2 square matrices given by the formulas
and
The direct substitution of both the expressions (2.2) and (2.3) into the matrix-valued zero-curvature equation (2.1) gives rise to the following set of semi-discrete nonlinear equations:
and
with the functions s_{11}(n), u_{11}(n), r_{12}(n), t_{12}(n), v_{12}(n) and u_{22}(n), s_{22}(n), v_{21}(n), t_{21}(n), r_{21}(n) serving as the prototype field variables and the coordinate-independent parameters a_{11}, c_{11} and e_{22}, c_{22} taken as arbitrary functions of time τ.
The obtained general system (2.4)–(2.13) is the first system in an infinite hierarchy generated by the chosen spectral operator (2.2). In order to isolate the Mth integrable system, the respective auxiliary evolution operator should be extended to the form contained the spectral parameter z in the same powers as the Mth power of the first evolution operator (2.3). The number and chiefly the sense of field variables remain the same for each system from the hierarchy since they are dictated by the same form (2.2) of the auxiliary spectral operator.
The set of equations (2.4)–(2.13) formalizing the first general integrable system are seen to be separated into the two mutually symmetric subsets (2.4)–(2.8) and (2.9)–(2.13). As a consequence, it permits a number of particular integrable reductions feasible for physical applications. Thus, the early announced six-component semi-discrete nonlinear Schrödinger system with attractive-type nonlinearities (1.1)–(1.10) is obliged being integrable by virtue of following relationships:
and
supplemented, as we already know, by the pairwise symmetries of complex conjugation ψ_{+}(n)=ϕ+*(n), ψ(n) = ϕ^{*}(n), ψ_{−}(n)=ϕ−*(n), θ(n) = η^{*}(n), ν(n) = μ^{*}(n) between the field variables.
Remarkably, that the same notations (2.14)–(2.26) give rise to the six-component semi-discrete integrable nonlinear Schrödinger system with repulsive-type nonlinearities, provided the pairwise symmetries between the field variables have been modified as follows: ψ_{+}(n)=−ϕ+*(n), ψ(n) = −ϕ^{*}(n), ψ_{−}(n)=−ϕ−*(n), θ(n) = η^{*}(n), ν(n) = μ^{*}(n).
III. PRINCIPAL LOCAL CONSERVATION LAWS FROM THE INFINITE HIERARCHY
The integrability in the Lax sense makes it possible to engage the explicit form of zero-curvature representation (2.1)–(2.3) as a powerful tool in generating an infinite chain of local conservation laws, characterizing the general integrable nonlinear system of interest (2.4)–(2.13).
The most evident approach is to contract the zero-curvature equation (2.1) to the form
looking as some universal local conservation law, and then to take into account the independence of its right-hand-side part of the spectral parameter z in combination with the Laurent-type polynomial embodiment of the quantity det L(n|z). As a result, we come to the five local conservation laws
with the local densities ρ_{+2}(n), ρ_{+1}(n), ρ_{0}(n), ρ_{−1}(n), ρ_{−2}(n) given by the expressions
The local current J_{0}(n + 1/2|n − 1/2) turns out to be common for all five local conservation laws (3.2)–(3.6) and its form is specified by the expression
The main implication of the obtained local conservation laws (3.2)–(3.6) is the chain of equalities ρ̇{+2}(n)=ρ̇{+1}(n)=ρ̇{0}(n)=ρ̇{−1}(n)=ρ̇{−2}(n) imposing four differential constraints onto the prototype field variables s_{11}(n), u_{11}(n), r_{12}(n), t_{12}(n), v_{12}(n) and u_{22}(n), s_{22}(n), v_{21}(n), t_{21}(n), r_{21}(n). The integral version of these constrains implies that the functions exp[ρ_{+2}(n)], exp[ρ_{+1}(n)], exp[ρ_{0}(n)], exp[ρ_{−1}(n)], exp[ρ_{−2}(n)] must differ from each other only by the factors independent of time variable τ. To preserve the uniformity of space, these factors must be regarded as independent of spatial variable n too. The above-mentioned constraints are the natural property of the general nonlinear system (2.4)–(2.13), and this observation substantiates the natural separation of field variables into the basic (independent) and concomitant (dependent) ones as that have already been proclaimed for the six-component semi-discrete integrable nonlinear Schrödinger system (1.1)–(1.10).
To be precise, we write down all four natural constraints as applied to the six-component semi-discrete integrable nonlinear Schrödinger system (1.1)–(1.10) in detail. Thus, assuming the basic fields ϕ_{+}(n), ϕ(n), ϕ_{−}(n), ψ_{+}(n), ψ(n), ψ_{−}(n) to be vanishing at both spatial infinities |n| → ∞ and the concomitant fields η(n), μ(n), θ(n), ν(n) to be lying on the spatially uniform nonzero backgrounds lim_{|n|→∞}η(n) = η, lim_{|n|→∞}μ(n) = μ, lim_{|n|→∞}θ(n) = θ, lim_{|n|→∞}ν(n) = ν, we have
where the background parameters η, μ and θ, ν are obliged being both time- and coordinate-independent.
The rest of the local conservation laws can be obtained in the framework of direct recurrent approach [19,20] written in its rationalized formulation [26,27].
The first step of this approach consists in solving recursively the set of Riccati equations
relative to the auxiliary functions Γ_{jk}(n|z) expanded as appropriate infinite series in powers (presumably positive or negative) of the spectral parameter z. Here the quantities L_{jk}(n|z) denote the matrix elements of the spectral operator L(n|z) given in general by some R × R square matrix, whereas the functions Γ_{jk}(n|z) are constrained by the rule
Once the required accuracy of their expansions has been attained, the functions Γ_{jk}(n|z) should be inserted into the set of generating equations
where the functions M_{jk}(n|z) and B_{jk}(n|z) are defined by the expressions
while the quantities A_{jk}(n|z) stand for the matrix elements of evolution operator A(n|z) given in general by some R × R square matrix. Then, collecting the terms with the common powers of the spectral parameter z, we come to the desired collection of local conservation laws whose number is truncated by the adopted accuracy of auxiliary functions Γ_{jk}(n|z). In so doing, the quantities ln M_{jj}(n|z) manifest themselves as the generating functions of local densities, while the quantities B_{jj}(n|z) appear as the generating functions of local currents.
Having been applied to the system with operators L(n|z) and A(n|z) given by the 2 × 2 square matrices, the above-described procedure is simplified considerably since it involves only one independent auxiliary function Γ_{12}(n|z) or Γ_{21}(n|z).
Thus, taking into account the explicit expressions (2.2) and (2.3) for the spectral L(n|z) and evolution A(n|z) operators, it is possible to generate a number of local conservation laws related to the general semi-discrete nonlinear system of our interest (2.4)–(2.13). For our forthcoming purposes of system Hamiltonian formulation, only few of the first local densities related to respective local conservation laws will be necessary. Their list is as follows:
and
Inasmuch as any function of the form f(n + 1|n) − f(n|n − 1) can always be taken as a density in some trivial local conservation law, the local densities ρ12+(n) and ρ21+(n) should be considered as physically equivalent. The same remark concerns the local densities ρ21−(n) and ρ12−(n) too.
IV. POISSON STRUCTURE AND HAMILTONIAN REPRESENTATION OF THE SIX-COMPONENT SEMI-DISCRETE INTEGRABLE NONLINEAR SCHRÖDINGER SYSTEM
Analyzing the expressions (3.7)–(3.11) and (3.22)–(3.25) for the lowest local densities, we see that only the latter ones (3.22)–(3.25) contain the functions located on the two neighboring unit cells. Thus, in order to reproduce the dispersive effects in any integrable nonlinear system reducible from the general one (2.4)–(2.13), we must include some appropriate superposition of second local densities (3.22)–(3.25) into the density of respective Hamiltonian function. In principle, the density of Hamiltonian function may incorporate the first local densities (3.7)–(3.11); however, they can easily be eliminated from the dynamic equations by the proper gauge transformation. As the matter of fact, such an eliminating gauge has been fixed in the six-component semi-discrete nonlinear Schrödinger system (1.1)–(1.10) when assuming the parameters c_{11} and c_{22} being coincident (2.25).
Taking into account these observations, the Hamiltonian function, adapted to the needs of the six-component semi-discrete nonlinear Schrödinger system with attractive-type nonlinearities (1.1)–(1.10), acquires the form
This Hamiltonian function can in principle be dependent on time τ parametrically via the assumed time dependencies of coupling parameters α and β.
In order to define correctly the Poisson structure (Poisson bracket) relevant to the six-component semi-discrete nonlinear Schrödinger system with attractive-type nonlinearities (1.1)–(1.10) and to find out the system Hamiltonian representation, we must remember that the field variables η(n), μ(n) and θ(n), ν(n) (referred to as the concomitant ones) are actually dependent on the basic field variables ϕ_{+}(n), ϕ(n), ϕ_{−}(n) and ψ_{+}(n), ψ(n), ψ_{−}(n). As a consequence, when starting to apply the general principles of Hamiltonian consideration [6,11,38], we must operate only with the basic equations [i.e., Eqs. (1.1)–(1.6)] and try to rewrite them in the unified form
with the quantity H being the Hamiltonian function (4.1) and the matrix elements J_{λϰ}(n|m) of structure (symplectic) matrix J subjected to the skew symmetry J_{ϰλ}(m|n) = −J_{λϰ}(n|m), where the quantities y_{1}(n), y_{2}(n), y_{3}(n), y_{4}(n), y_{5}(n), y_{6}(n) constitute some complete set of independent field variables written in the unified form. The record (4.2) is rather universal inasmuch as it permits a number of particular functional relationships between the unified and basic field variables. In what follows, we adopt the simplest linear correspondence between these two sets of field variables given by the relations
The most simple way to collect the tentative expressions for the elements J_{λϰ}(n|m) of the symplectic matrix is to compare the basic equations (1.1)–(1.6) with their unified counterparts (4.2) written in the form
complying with the definition [6,11,38]
of Poisson bracket {F, G} between two arbitrary functions F and G. This recipe of comparison allows us to collect the vast majority of candidates on matrix elements J_{λϰ}(n|m) in view of their evident relationships J_{λϰ}(n|m) = −{y_{λ}(n), y_{ϰ}(m)} with the relevant fundamental Poisson brackets {y_{λ}(n), y_{ϰ}(m)}. However, to identify the tentative expressions for the matrix elements J_{25}(n|m) and J_{52}(n|m), we are obliged to invoke the concomitant evolution equations (1.7)–(1.10) and their counterparts written in terms of Poisson brackets as well as to take into account the early obtained expressions (3.13)–(3.16) for the natural constraints. The ultimate list of nonzero candidates on the matrix elements J_{λϰ}(n|m) is given by formulas
Once all candidates on the matrix elements J_{λϰ}(n|m) have been found, we must verify that the expression (4.10) for the quantity {F, G} meets all requirements supporting the definition of Poisson bracket [6,11,38]. The most critical of them is the demand
claiming to be the Jacobi identity. According to the general rule [6,11,18,38], the demand (4.20) is tantamount to the set of equations
where the indices marked by letters μ and ν have nothing to do with the background parameters defined as μ = lim_{|n|→∞}μ(n) and ν = lim_{|n|→∞}ν(n).
For the practical use of the Jacobi test (4.21), it is reasonable to modify it to the form
substantiated by the formula
following from the definition of Poisson bracket (4.10). Thus, in order to verify the Jacobi identity, we must collect the candidates on Poisson brackets between each pair of field variables including both the basic and the concomitant ones. This task is conceptually analogous to those described for the collecting procedure of quantities J_{λϰ}(n|m). Inasmuch as the total number of field variables is equal to ten, the sufficient number of required candidates on the elementary Poisson brackets is equal to fifty five. The necessary calculations show that the modified Jacobi test (4.22) is proved to be fulfilled for any admissible combination of indices λ, μ, ν and coordinates l, m, n. As a result, the early written expressions (4.11)–(4.19) for the tentative quantities J_{λϰ}(n|m) increase their status and determine the actual nonzero elements of the structure (symplectic) matrix. These expressions (4.11)–(4.19), accompanied by the formulas (3.13)–(3.16) for the natural constraints, clearly indicate that the symplectic matrix J remains unsplittable even at zero values of all background parameters η = 0 = θ and μ = 0 = ν.
Below we will write down explicitly all fifty five elementary Poisson brackets characterizing the integrable nonlinear Schrödinger system under study (1.1)–(1.10). Their list is as follows:
Relying upon these results (4.24)–(4.78), it can be verified that the multi-component semi-discrete nonlinear Schrödinger system with attractive-type nonlinearities (1.1)–(1.10) permits the concise Hamiltonian representation
and
with the Hamiltonian function H given by the early adopted formula (4.1).
Inasmuch as the Hamiltonian function itself (4.1) is given by the quadratic form with respect to the field variables, the nonlinear terms in the dynamic equations (4.79)–(4.88) arise exclusively, thanks to the highly nonstandard form of relevant Poisson brackets (4.24)–(4.78).
It is worth noticing that the nonstandard form of Poisson structure is rather a typical property of integrable nonlinear systems associated with the discrete spectral problems. For example, even the simplest integrable nonlinear Schrödinger system on a purely one-dimensional lattice with one structural element in the unit cell [1,2] is known to possess the nonstandard fundamental Poisson brackets [7,8,16]. Among the more complex representatives, characterized by the nonstandard Poisson brackets, we would like to mention the nonlinear Schrödinger systems on quasi-one-dimensional lattices with two structural elements in the unit cell [22,25,28,29].
V. DARBOUX AND IMPLICIT BÄCKLUND TRANSFORMATIONS IN GENERAL TERMS
The Darboux transformation approach to the semi-discrete integrable nonlinear systems has been introduced into the soliton theory by Matveev and Salle [12,13], and now it is widely recognized as one of the most powerful methods in constructing the explicit solutions of such systems [3,4,9,10,15,28,29,34–37,39].
Taking into account the basic principles of the Darboux transformation method inspected on more simple semi-discrete integrable nonlinear systems [28,29,34,35], we shall amend them to specify all distinctive features of auxiliary linear problem related to the general integrable nonlinear system on a lattice with three structural elements in the unit cell (2.4)–(2.13) and hence to any of its numerous reductions.
Below we describe the whole Darboux transformation scheme starting with two auxiliary linear matrix-valued equations
and
referred to as the auxiliary linear problem. Here X(n|z) denotes the function given by the square matrix of the same rank as the spectral L(n|z) and evolution A(n|z) matrices. The compatibility condition between Eqs. (5.1) and (5.2) is known [17] to be formalized as the zero-curvature relation (2.1) which under the proper choice of spectral and evolution matrices gives rise to one or another semi-discrete integrable nonlinear system. For this reason, instead of dealing directly with an integrable nonlinear system, it is possible to extract a lot of valuable information about its dynamics by considering the respective auxiliary linear problem (5.1) and (5.2) in the framework of Darboux transformation approach.
When considering the general nonlinear system of our interest (2.4)–(2.13) we shall understand the matrices L(n|z) and A(n|z) as the 2 × 2 square matrices invoking (where necessary) their explicit representations (2.2) and (2.3). Thus, the matrix X(n|z) must be assumed as a 2 × 2 square matrix too.
Recollecting that the prototype field variables s_{11}(n), u_{11}(n), r_{12}(n), t_{12}(n), v_{12}(n), u_{22}(n), s_{22}(n), v_{21}(n), t_{21}(n), r_{21}(n) completely determine the spectral L(n|z) and evolution A(n|z) operators, it is reasonable to distinguish two distinct solutions ^{s}s_{11}(n), ^{s}u_{11}(n), ^{s}r_{12}(n), ^{s}t_{12}(n), ^{s}v_{12}(n), ^{s}u_{22}(n), ^{s}s_{22}(n), ^{s}v_{21}(n), ^{s}t_{21}(n), ^{s}r_{21}(n) and ^{c}s_{11}(n), ^{c}u_{11}(n), ^{c}r_{12}(n), ^{c}t_{12}(n), ^{c}v_{12}(n), ^{c}u_{22}(n), ^{c}s_{22}(n), ^{c}v_{21}(n), ^{c}t_{21}(n), ^{c}r_{21}(n) of general integrable nonlinear system (2.4)–(2.13) by two sets of matrices ^{s}L(n|z), ^{s}A(n|z) and ^{c}L(n|z), ^{c}A(n|z), respectively. Then, we can formally deal with the s-labeled
and c-labeled
zero-curvature equations. In view of this agreement, there are no principal restrictions to incorporate the s-labeled auxiliary linear problem
associated with the matrices ^{s}L(n|z), ^{s}A(n|z), ^{s}X(n|z), and c-labeled auxiliary linear problem
associated with the matrices ^{c}L(n|z), ^{c}A(n|z), ^{c}X(n|z), into a consolidated Darboux scheme.
By definition [5], the Darboux transformation
connects the solutions ^{s}X(n|z) and ^{c}X(n|z) of s-labeled (5.5) and (5.6) and the c-labeled (5.7) and (5.8) auxiliary linear problems through the Darboux matrix ^{c}D(n|z). The Darboux matrix ^{c}D(n|z) must obey the set of matrix equations
serving as the spatial (5.10) and temporal (5.11) compatibility conditions between the s-labeled (5.5) and (5.6) and c-labeled (5.7) and (5.8) auxiliary linear problems. It is necessary to stress that these conditions (5.10) and (5.11) in combination with the s-labeled zero-curvature equation (5.3) lead to the c-labeled one (5.4). Conversely, the temporal compatibility condition (5.11) can be safely treated as the direct consequence of the spatial one (5.10), if both the s-labeled and c-labeled zero-curvature equations (5.3) and (5.4) are regarded as being satisfied.
In order to grasp the thread of a soliton generation in the general nonlinear system (2.4)–(2.13), let us seek the Darboux matrix in the form
This ansatz (5.12) prescribes presumably the simplest variant of the Darboux matrix relevant to our task, and its mission is expected to create one more soliton in a crop (c-labeled) solution of the nonlinear system, as compared with the seed (s-labeled) one. When we intend to create two or more solitons, the ansatz for the Darboux matrix should be extended to the form containing the spectral parameter in the same powers as the product of two or more simplest Darboux matrices, respectively.
Using the adopted ansatz (5.12) for the Darboux matrix, the spatial compatibility condition (5.10) can be rewritten as sixteen relationships between the functions specifying the Darboux matrix ^{c}D(n|z) and functions involved into the matrices ^{s}L(n|z) and ^{c}L(n|z). The respective expressions read as follows:
and
These sixteen equations (5.13)–(5.28) establish implicitly the Bäcklund transformation between the seed ^{s}s_{11}(n), ^{s}u_{11}(n), ^{s}r_{12}(n), ^{s}t_{12}(n), ^{s}v_{12}(n), ^{s}u_{22}(n), ^{s}s_{22}(n), ^{s}v_{21}(n), ^{s}t_{21}(n), ^{s}r_{21}(n) and crop ^{c}s_{11}(n), ^{c}u_{11}(n), ^{c}r_{12}(n), ^{c}t_{12}(n), ^{c}v_{12}(n), ^{c}u_{22}(n), ^{c}s_{22}(n), ^{c}v_{21}(n), ^{c}t_{21}(n), ^{c}r_{21}(n) solutions. In order to derive the explicit version of the Bäcklund transformation, it is necessary to exclude all six mediating Darboux functions ^{c}T_{11}(n), ^{c}S_{12}(n), ^{c}U_{12}(n), ^{c}T_{22}(n), ^{c}U_{21}(n), ^{c}S_{21}(n) from Eqs. (5.13)–(5.28) and to obtain only ten explicit transformation formulas. Meanwhile, it is quite sufficient to bear in mind the very existence of the Bäcklund transformation in its explicit form, but to prefer, namely, its implicit form (5.13)–(5.28) for the practical purposes. This observation instills a firm confidence that the spatial compatibility condition (5.10) written as sixteen expanded equations (5.13)–(5.28) must be considered as the innerly noncontradictory tool in developing the Darboux dressing technique to generate the nontrivial solutions of general nonlinear system (2.4)–(2.13).
The standpoint of the Darboux dressing method consists in recovering the Darboux functions relying upon certain general spectral properties of the adopted Darboux ansatz under the premise that the seed solution (given by the s-labeled field functions) of nonlinear system was preassigned. In so doing, we must take into account that two Darboux functions ^{c}S_{12}(n) and ^{c}U_{21}(n) actually are already known by virtue of simple formulas (5.16) and (5.24) serving as their definitions. Should the program of recovering the Darboux functions has been accomplished, the generation of crop solution (given by the c-labeled field functions) is reduced to the solution of two sets of purely linear nonhomogeneous algebraic equations properly chosen among the expanded form (5.13)–(5.28) of spatial compatibility condition (5.10). Thus, the set of equations determining ^{c}s_{11}(n), ^{c}u_{11}(n), ^{c}r_{12}(n), ^{c}t_{12}(n), ^{c}v_{12}(n) should contain the following five equations: (5.13), (5.15), (5.17), (5.19), and (5.20), whereas Eqs. (5.14) and (5.18) can be used for the verification of obtained results. Similarly, the set of equations determining ^{c}u_{22}(n), ^{c}s_{22}(n), ^{c}v_{21}(n), ^{c}t_{21}(n), ^{c}r_{21}(n) should contain the following five equations: (5.21), (5.23), (5.25), (5.27), and (5.28), whereas Eqs. (5.22) and (5.26) can be used for the verification of obtained results.
To succeed with recovering of four still unknown Darboux functions ^{c}T_{11}(n), ^{c}U_{12}(n), ^{c}T_{22}(n), ^{c}S_{21}(n) and as a consequence with developing of the whole Darboux dressing method, as applied to our general integrable nonlinear system (2.4)–(2.13), it is necessary to analyze the contracted evolution equation
deducible from the properly prepared temporal compatibility condition (5.11) by virtue of trace operation. In particular, observing that the combination Sp ^{c}A(n|z) − Sp ^{s}A(n|z) does not depend on the spectral parameter z, we can readily conclude that the quantities
entering the expression
must evolve in a manner leading to the chain of equalities
As a consequence, the functions ^{c}W_{+}(n), ^{c}W_{0}(n), ^{c}W_{−}(n) must differ only by the factors independent of time. In addition, the requirement of space uniformity restricts these time-independent factors to be independent of space coordinate too. Thereafter, the formula (5.33) for the determinant of the Darboux matrix acquires the form
where the parameters ^{c}T_{11} and ^{c}T_{22} are set to be time- and coordinate-independent, while the functions ^{c}S_{12}(n), ^{c}U_{12}(n) and ^{c}U_{21}(n), ^{c}S_{21}(n) are assumed to be rapidly vanishing at both spatial infinities. The obtained expression (5.35) shows that all four roots ^{c}z_{r} (r = 1, 2, 3, 4) of equation det ^{c}D(n|z) = 0 are fixed to be independent both of time and coordinate variables.
By virtue of evident identity det ^{c}D(n|^{c}z_{r}) ≡ 0, the definition of the Darboux transformation (5.9) immediately yields det ^{c}X(n|^{c}z_{r}) = 0. The last equality implies that
or the same in more detail
where ^{c}X_{jk}(n|z) and ^{c}D_{jk}(n|z) are the matrix elements of matrices ^{c}X(n|z) and ^{c}D(n|z), respectively. Here all eight spectral parameters ^{c}ε_{k}(^{c}z_{r}) (k = 1, 2; r = 1, 2, 3, 4) are obliged being independent both of time τ and coordinate n. This statement has a status of rigorously proved theorem.
The obtained formula (5.37) contains the nonuniform set of eight linear algebraic equations (j = 1, 2; r = 1, 2, 3, 4) allowing us to express the unknown Darboux functions ^{c}T_{11}(n), ^{c}U_{12}(n), ^{c}T_{22}(n), ^{c}S_{21}(n) via the a priori known constituent parts [i.e., via the Darboux functions ^{c}S_{12}(n) = ^{s}r_{12}(n) and ^{c}U_{21}(n) = ^{s}v_{21}(n) as well as the unity coefficients near the parameters z^{2} and z^{−2}] of the Darboux matrix (5.12) and through the solution ^{s}X(n|z) of the s-labeled auxiliary linear problem (5.5) and (5.6) with the spectral coefficients ^{c}ε_{k}(^{c}z_{r}) and roots ^{c}z_{r} being incorporated. The solution ^{s}X(n|z) in turn is completely determined by the s-labeled (seed) solution ^{s}s_{11}(n), ^{s}u_{11}(n), ^{s}r_{12}(n), ^{s}t_{12}(n), ^{s}v_{12}(n), ^{s}u_{22}(n), ^{s}s_{22}(n), ^{s}v_{21}(n), ^{s}t_{21}(n), ^{s}r_{21}(n) to the general integrable nonlinear system of our interest (2.4)–(2.13), inasmuch as, namely, the seed field functions prescribe the very definitions of s-labeled spectral ^{s}L(n|z) and evolution ^{s}A(n|z) matrices specifying the particulars of s-labeled auxiliary linear problem (5.5) and (5.6). Thus, in combination with early obtained expanded formulas (5.13)–(5.28) for the spatial compatibility condition (5.10), we come to the closed Darboux dressing procedure permitting to generate the new (crop) solution ^{c}s_{11}(n), ^{c}u_{11}(n), ^{c}r_{12}(n), ^{c}t_{12}(n), ^{c}v_{12}(n), ^{c}u_{22}(n), ^{c}s_{22}(n), ^{c}v_{21}(n), ^{c}t_{21}(n), ^{c}r_{21}(n) of general nonlinear system (2.4)–(2.13) from the already known (seed) one ^{s}s_{11}(n), ^{s}u_{11}(n), ^{s}r_{12}(n), ^{s}t_{12}(n), ^{s}v_{12}(n), ^{s}u_{22}(n), ^{s}s_{22}(n), ^{s}v_{21}(n), ^{s}t_{21}(n), ^{s}r_{21}(n).
The seeming discrepancy between the number of unknown Darboux functions and the doubled number of equations for their calculation is readily resolvable by virtue of relevant symmetry relations specifying a particular reduced integrable nonlinear system and its auxiliary spectral characteristics.
VI. SYMMETRIES OF AUXILIARY MATRICES AND SPECTRAL DATA RELATED TO THE SIX-COMPONENT SEMI-DISCRETE NONLINEAR SCHRÖDINGER SYSTEM WITH ATTRACTIVE-TYPE NONLINEARITIES AS THE SIMPLIFYING FACTORS IN RECOVERING THE DARBOUX FUNCTIONS
The notations (2.14)–(2.26) establishing the relationships between the general integrable nonlinear system (2.4)–(2.13) and the six-component semi-discrete integrable nonlinear Schrödinger system (1.1)–(1.10) allow us to modify the general expressions (2.2) and (2.3) for the spectral L(n|z) and evolution A(n|z) operators to the forms
and
suitable for the six-component semi-discrete integrable nonlinear Schrödinger system (1.1)–(1.10).
Remembering that the attractive-type nonlinearities are supported by the pairwise complex conjugation of field variables ψ_{+}(n)=ϕ+*(n), ψ(n) = ϕ^{*}(n), ψ_{−}(n)=ϕ−*(n), θ(n) = η^{*}(n), ν(n) = μ^{*}(n) and coupling parameters β = α^{*}, it is easy to reveal that the spectral L(n|z) and evolution A(n|z) matrices, specified by formulas (6.1) and (6.2), display the following symmetry relations:
and
where the symbols σ_{2} and σ_{3} denote the second
and third
Pauli matrices. As for the matrix function X(n|z), its symmetry properties are given by the relationships
Evidently the similar symmetry properties must be true for both the s-labeled ^{s}L(n|z), ^{s}A(n|z), ^{s}X(n|z) and c-labeled ^{c}L(n|z), ^{c}A(n|z), ^{c}X(n|z) variants of the above inspected matrices L(n|z), A(n|z), X(n|z).
At last, the Darboux matrix (5.12) adapted to the needs of the nonlinear Schrödinger system with attractive-type nonlinearities is characterized by the symmetries
The former symmetry (6.11) for the Darboux matrix in particular implies the following symmetries:
for the Darboux functions. Moreover, in combination with the expression (5.35) for det ^{c}D(n|z), these symmetries (6.13)–(6.15) support the equality ^{c}T22*={c}T_{11} which suggests the following parameterizations:
where ^{c}γ and ^{c}ϰ are the real parameters independent of time τ and coordinate n. Then, for the roots ^{c}z_{r} of equation det ^{c}D(n|z) = 0 [with det ^{c}D(n|z) given by the formula (5.35)], we obtain
The last parametrization formulas (6.18) and (6.19) are seen to be compatible with the symmetry relations
between the roots ^{c}z_{r} of equation det ^{c}D(n|z) = 0.
The symmetries concerning the eight spectral parameters ^{c}ε_{k}(^{c}z_{r}) (k = 1, 2; r = 1, 2, 3, 4) are obtainable by applying the symmetry relations (6.9) and (6.10) for the matrix function X(n|z) in combination with the symmetry relations (6.18)–(6.21) for the roots ^{c}z_{r} to the set of equations (5.36) deciphering the essence of identity det ^{c}D(n|^{c}z_{r}) ≡ 0. The list of relevant symmetry relationships is as follows:
These symmetries (6.22)–(6.24) ensure the parameterization formulas
with ^{c}f and ^{c}g being the real parameters independent of time τ and coordinate n.
The analysis of all available symmetry properties provides a number of simplifications. The most significant among them is the possibility to reduce by half the number of nonhomogeneous linear algebraic equations encoded in the formula (5.37), pretending to determine the unknown Darboux functions ^{c}T_{11}(n), ^{c}U_{12}(n), ^{c}T_{22}(n), ^{c}S_{21}(n). After such a reduction, the number of linearly independent algebraic equations proves to coincide with the number of unknown Darboux functions, and hence the reduced set of equations becomes uniquely solvable.
Indeed, in view of symmetry properties just established for the quantities ^{c}X_{jk}(n|z), ^{c}ε_{k}(^{c}z_{r}), and ^{c}z_{r} in the case of the nonlinear Schrödinger system with attractive-type nonlinearities, we are able to contract the set of eight equations (5.37) for the four unknown Darboux functions ^{c}T_{11}(n), ^{c}U_{12}(n), ^{c}T_{22}(n), ^{c}S_{21}(n) to the set of just four linearly independent equations. The reduced set splits into the two following subsets:
and
for the two pairs ^{c}T_{11}(n), ^{c}U_{12}(n) and ^{c}T_{22}(n), ^{c}S_{21}(n) of the Darboux functions, respectively. Here the shorthand notation
has been introduced.
Recovering the Darboux functions from these two linear subsets (6.27), (6.28) and (6.29), (6.30) is a straightforward task and we have
and
These formulas establish the intermediate link in the recurrent Darboux dressing procedure of generating the components ^{c}s_{11}(n), ^{c}u_{11}(n), ^{c}r_{12}(n), ^{c}t_{12}(n), ^{c}v_{12}(n) and ^{c}u_{22}(n), ^{c}s_{22}(n), ^{c}v_{21}(n), ^{c}t_{21}(n), ^{c}r_{21}(n) of the crop solution from the components ^{s}s_{11}(n), ^{s}u_{11}(n), ^{s}r_{12}(n), ^{s}t_{12}(n), ^{s}v_{12}(n) and ^{s}u_{22}(n), ^{s}s_{22}(n), ^{s}v_{21}(n), ^{s}t_{21}(n)^{s}r_{21}(n) of the seed solution. On the one hand, this statement assumes that all s-labeled quantities on the right-hand-side parts of these formulas (6.32)–(6.35) are already known, and on the other hand, it suggests that the components ^{c}s_{11}(n), ^{c}u_{11}(n), ^{c}r_{12}(n), ^{c}t_{12}(n), ^{c}v_{12}(n) and ^{c}u_{22}(n), ^{c}s_{22}(n), ^{c}v_{21}(n), ^{c}t_{21}(n), ^{c}r_{21}(n) of the crop solution still must be extracted from the two sets of nonhomogeneous linear algebraic equations (5.13), (5.15), (5.17), (5.19), (5.20) and (5.21), (5.23), (5.25), (5.27), (5.28) with the above-written expressions (6.32)–(6.35) for the Darboux functions ^{c}T_{11}(n), ^{c}U_{12}(n) and ^{c}T_{22}(n), ^{c}S_{21}(n) having been taken into account.
VII. TEN-COMPONENT SOLITON SOLUTION FOR THE SIX-COMPONENT SEMI-DISCRETE INTEGRABLE NONLINEAR SCHRÖDINGER SYSTEM WITH ATTRACTIVE-TYPE NONLINEARITIES
When dealing with the recurrent Darboux dressing procedure, it is convenient to treat the upper-front indices s and c, labeling a large collection of early introduced quantities as being the nonnegative integers related by the equality c − s = 1. The seed solution for each next recurrent step must be taken as the crop solution from the previous recurrent step. In so doing, the lowest seed solution should be marked as the zeroth one, while the lowest crop solution as the first one. Moreover, it is reasonable to choose the lowest seed solution being as simple as possible in order to succeed in preparation of all quantities marked by the zeroth upper-front index: s = 0.
In order to generate the ten-component one-soliton solution to the six-component semi-discrete integrable nonlinear Schrödinger system with attractive-type nonlinearities (1.1)–(1.10), it is sufficient to start with the trivial (vacuum) seed solution formalized by the expressions
and
Then the zero-labeled spectral and evolution matrices become independent of the coordinate variable
while the spectral matrix ^{0}L(z) is seen to be independent of time variable in addition.
As a consequence, the s-labeled zero-curvature equation (5.3) is reduced to the strict commutativity relation
implying that matrices
and
share the same set of eigenfunctions
with the index k running through the integers 1 and 2, while the quantity δ_{jk} stands for the Kronecker symbol. The eigenvalues ζ_{k}(z) and Λ̇{k}(z) of matrices ^{0}L(z) and ^{0}A(z) are, respectively, as follows:
and
These eigenvalues have emerged to play a fundamental part on each cth recurrent step of the Darboux dressing procedure via specifications of the spectral parameter z by the proper set of roots ^{c}z_{r} (r = 1, 2).
In order to compactify the expressions for quantities ζ_{k}(^{c}z_{r}) obtained after inserting the roots ^{c}z_{r} into expressions (7.17) and (7.18) for the eigenvalues ζ_{k}(z), it is convenient to operate with the following parametrization formulas:
and
defining the two pairs of real constant parameters ^{c}γ_{+}, ^{c}ϰ_{+} and ^{c}γ_{−}, ^{c}ϰ_{−} in terms of one pair of real constant spectral parameters ^{c}γ and ^{c}ϰ introduced earlier [see formulas (6.16) and (6.17)].
Proceeding with vacuum seed solution (7.1)–(7.10), it can be readily checked that the components ^{0}X_{jk}(n|z) of the solution ^{0}X(n|z) to the s-labeled auxiliary problem (5.5) and (5.6) with s = 0 should be taken in the form
with the functions Λ_{k}(z) determined by expressions
Here Λ is the real constant parameter, while functions A and B are the solutions of first order ordinary differential equations
and
restricted by the condition of complex conjugation B^{*} = A.
Now we have collected all preliminary results necessary to recover the one-soliton solution of the six-component semi-discrete integrable nonlinear Schrödinger system with attractive-type nonlinearities explicitly. Indeed, once the expression (7.25) for the components ^{0}X_{jk}(n|z) of auxiliary matrix function ^{0}X(n|z) is already known, the definition (6.31) of the quantities ^{s}Y_{j}(n|^{c}z_{r}) (j = 1, 2; r = 1, 2) yields
This formula (7.30) in combination with the zero values ^{0}r_{12}(n) = 0 = ^{0}v_{21}(n) of seed soliton components ^{0}r_{12}(n) and ^{0}v_{21}(n) allows us to adapt the expressions (6.32)–(6.35) for the Darboux function ^{c}T_{11}(n), ^{c}U_{12}(n), ^{c}T_{22}(n), ^{c}S_{21}(n) to the case of one-soliton solution. The obtained expressions for the Darboux functions ^{1}T_{11}(n), ^{1}U_{12}(n), ^{1}T_{22}(n), ^{1}S_{21}(n) must be inserted into the two sets of nonhomogeneous linear equations (5.13), (5.15), (5.17), (5.19), (5.20) and (5.21), (5.23), (5.25), (5.27), (5.28) simplified beforehand by the particulars of the seed solution (7.1)–(7.10). Resolving the obtained simplified sets of nonhomogeneous linear equations with respect to the crop components ^{1}s_{11}(n), ^{1}u_{11}(n), ^{1}r_{12}(n), ^{1}t_{12}(n), ^{1}v_{12}(n) and ^{1}u_{22}(n), ^{1}s_{22}(n), ^{1}v_{21}(n), ^{1}t_{21}(n), ^{1}r_{21}(n) and using the early adopted parametrization formulas (6.18), (6.19), (6.25), (6.26) and (7.21)–(7.24), we come at last to the one-soliton solution of our interest. Below we present both basic and concomitant components of the obtained one-soliton solution in notations (2.14)–(2.23) adequate for the six-component semi-discrete integrable nonlinear Schrödinger system with attractive-type nonlinearities (1.1)–(1.10). Omitting, for the sake of brevity, the upper-front index c = 1 whenever it appears, we have
and
Here the real coordinate quantities x and y responsible for the dynamical properties of multi-component soliton are defined by the expressions
and
where x_{0} and y_{0} are the arbitrary constant real coordinate parameters. To be precise, these parameters are linked with the early introduced ones ^{1}f ≡ f, ^{1}g ≡ g, and Λ [see formulas (6.25), (6.26), (7.26), and (7.27)] by the linear relationships
and
The coordinate s and phase ξ splitting parameters are given by the expressions
and
According to the adopted definitions (7.21)–(7.24), (7.41), (7.42) and (7.45), (7.46), the key characteristics of the obtained multi-component soliton solution (7.31)–(7.40) are seen to be essentially dependent on the values of background parameters η, θ and μ, ν.
Thus, the actual wave vector K = 3(ϰ_{+} + ϰ_{−}) attributed to the soliton solution (7.31)–(7.40) turns out to be determined by the primer wave vector k = 6ϰ and the primer inverse longitudinal size of soliton 6γ combined. The same statement concerns also the actual inverse longitudinal size of the soliton Γ = 3(γ_{+} + γ_{−}). Here we must bear in mind that the actual quantities K and Γ coincide with their primer counterparts k and 6γ only in the limit when all background parameters η, θ and μ, ν are vanished: η = 0 = θ and μ = 0 = ν.
In general, due to the very cumbersome dependence of k on K, it is highly unpractical to consider the phase frequency Ω, defined as
to be the function of actual wave vector K. Fortunately the phase frequency Ω considered as the function of primer wave vector k has the rather simple form
where the primer wave vector k can run within the extended primer Brillouin zone −3π ≤ k ≤ + 3π. Here we readily observe the continuity of dispersion law (7.48) on the whole interval of the extended primer Brillouin zone −3π ≤ k ≤ + 3π including even potentially vulnerable points −3π, −π and +π, +3π.
By contrast, the phase frequency Ω considered as the function of actual wave vector K at nonzero values of background parameters η, θ and μ, ν can possess the points of discontinuities and even can demonstrate the domains of instabilities (i.e., domains where Ω acquires the complex values). This conjecture is in line with the preliminary analysis of the algebraic cubic dispersion equation, determining the spectrum of low-amplitude excitations [i.e., excitations in the linearized version of the six-component semi-discrete integrable nonlinear Schrödinger system (1.1)–(1.10)].
On the other hand, we can introduce the quantity
characterizing the velocity of soliton along the quasi-one-dimensional lattice. For the same reasons as with the phase frequency Ω (7.47), it is preferable to deal with soliton velocity v (7.49) as the function of primer wave vector k and we have
where the quantity 3(γ_{+} + γ_{−}), as we already know, is the function of the primer inverse longitudinal size of soliton 6γ and the primer wave vector k.
Finalizing the description of soliton parameters, it is necessary to pay particular attention on the potential possibility to postulate any time dependencies of coupling parameters α and β admissible by their symmetry relation β = α^{*}. This property appears to be a very important tool in modeling the impact of a wide class of parametric stimulations affecting the system dynamics but preserving the system integrability. Moreover, the temporal adjustability of coupling parameters is proved to be closely related to the strict description of Bloch oscillations in the semi-discrete integrable nonlinear systems biased by the external linear potential [21,23,30].
VIII. CONCLUSION
The main objective of this work was to present the key properties of the general semi-discrete integrable nonlinear system on a quasi-one-dimensional lattice with three structural elements in the unit cell and to adapt them to the needs of a six-component semi-discrete integrable nonlinear Schrödinger system presumably with attractive-type nonlinearities. This task is motivated by the well-known fact that the semi-discrete integrable nonlinear Schrödinger systems play the fundamental part in different fields of physical science [see our recent article (Ref [29]) and the references therein], where the description of more complex phenomena requires invoking the more complex multi-component nonlinear models.
Not repeating all the results summarized in the abstract, we nevertheless pay attention on the rather productive concept of concomitant fields arising in the integrable systems whose auxiliary spectral operator has the determinant dependent on the spectral parameter. The matter is that the nonzero background values of concomitant fields lead effectively to several additional types of inter-site resonant interactions between the basic fields. In the case of six-component semi-discrete integrable nonlinear Schrödinger system presumably with attractive-type nonlinearities, such additional resonant interactions are associated with the three types of inter-site resonant coupling parameters (i) −αν, −βμ; (ii) αμ, βν; (iii) −αθ, −βη. Thus, in the aggregate, the latter system supports the four types of inter-site resonant interactions essentially enriching its dynamics.
Another principal point concerns the unified insight into a certain extended class of multi-component integrable nonlinear systems as a whole. Comparing the spectral operator related to the general semi-discrete integrable system with two structural elements in the unit cell considered in our recent publications [29,34,35] with the spectral operator related to the general semi-discrete integrable system with three structural elements in the unit cell considered in the present paper (2.2), one can readily observe that the former one contains the spectral parameter z in the same powers as the product of two Ablowitz–Ladik spectral operators, while the latter one contains the spectral parameter z in the same powers as the product of three Ablowitz–Ladik spectral operators. This observation establishes the universal rule for generating the general semi-discrete integrable system with S structural elements in the unit cell by postulating the spectral operator to be specified with the same powers of spectral parameter z as the product of S Ablowitz–Ladik spectral operators. Here the Ablowitz–Ladik spectral operator is understood in its commonly known 2 × 2 matrix representation [17]
As to the evolution operator for the first general semi-discrete integrable system with S structural elements in the unit cell (or for the Mth system from the respective infinite hierarchy), its Laurent-type spectral expansion must satisfy to the same requirements as those described in Sec. II for the first general semi-discrete integrable system with three structural elements in the unit cell (or for the Mth system from the respective infinite hierarchy).
