Dispersion relation of quasi-static electromagnetic modes in relativistic plasmas
Transverse quasi-static electromagnetic modes (ωkc≪1, where ω and k are the mode frequency and the wavenumber, respectively, and c is the speed of light) are studied in laser heated relativistic plasmas, where the electron thermal energy could be comparable to or greater than the electron rest mass energy. A dispersion relation of these modes valid in the whole collisionality regime is derived with the use of the relativistic Vlasov-Landau and Maxwell equations. The dissipative part of the dispersion relation is calculated with the Maxwell-Boltzmann-Jüttner distribution function, as a function of the Knudsen number kλ_{ei}, where λ_{ei} is the electron mean-free-path. It is shown that the dissipative part exhibits a continuous transition from the collisional regime [∼kλei{2}] to the Landau collisionless one [∼kλei{3}]. The relativistic electrical conductivity is also deduced and compared with the results reported in the literature. Taking into account the anisotropy of the distribution function induced by the inverse bremsstrahlung absorption, the stability analysis of the electromagnetic modes is presented. It is found that for typical inertial confinement fusion plasmas, strong growing modes could be driven.
I. INTRODUCTION
Recently, much attention has been paid to relativistic plasmas within inertial confined fusion (ICF). Indeed, the present and future experiments in ICF are conducted in the temperature range from 5keV up to 15keV (Refs [1] and  [2]) that corresponds to mildly relativistic plasmas. As a consequence, in such plasmas, the transport properties [3] and the dispersion relations of plasma modes [4,5] have met a great deal of interest. This work constitutes an extension of previous ones devoted to electrostatic modes, by studying the dispersion, the damping, and the amplification of electromagnetic (EM) modes. Moreover, in this work, we are interested in the electrical conductivity, which is a relevant plasma transport coefficient.
It is well known that electromagnetic modes play a crucial role in laboratory and astrophysical plasmas. For instance, in ICF schemes, the high-frequency EM waves are used to create totally ionized plasma and heat the plasma electrons mainly by an inverse bremsstrahlung mechanism. These EM waves could also be emitted by plasmas as a continuum (Hohlraum in ICF) or spectral lines (parametric instabilities). In the quasi-static range, EM modes are particularly important for their potential role in generating very intense magnetic fields which could affect drastically the plasma dynamics, and thus the momentum and the energy transport. The physical mechanism which drives such a magnetic field is shown in Ref [6], through the so-called Weibel instability. At the microscopic level, these transverse EM modes can be unstable when the electron distribution function (EDF) includes an anisotropic part in the momentum space. More precisely, it is the anisotropy in the average kinetic energy, i.e., temperature anisotropy, which provides a free energy source for this instability. In Ref [6], the plasma was modelled by a bi-Maxwellian EDF defined by a temperature T_{x} along a privileged x-axis and a temperature T_{⊥} in the Oy,Oz plane. Subsequent works on EM instability were performed in laser-produced plasmas by specifying further temperature anisotropy sources and by self-consistently calculating the anisotropic EDF from the kinetic theory. In Ref [7], the temperature anisotropy is induced by the electron transport in inhomogeneous plasmas, and the Chapman-Enskog formalism was used to calculate the EDF. In Refs [8–10], the temperature anisotropy originates due to the inverse bremsstrahlung mechanism, when the laser beam energy is preferentially absorbed along the direction of the laser electric field. The EDF was calculated by solving the Vlasov-Landau equation with spherical harmonics expansion. More recently, in Ref [11], the authors extended the EM stability analysis to the nonlinear range defined by a strong laser intensity where the anisotropic part of the EDF is no longer negligible with respect to the isotropic one.
The relativistic formulation of the EM instabilities has been initially investigated in astrophysical plasmas because of the important role of the self-generated B-field in many physical phenomena such as the gamma-ray burst [12] and relativistic jet sources [13]. In this astrophysical context, several works were reported, and the relativistic treatment of Weibel instability was performed with the use of various EDF ansätze. In Refs [14] and  [15], Yoon has proposed a generalization of the bi-Maxwellian EDF to anisotropic relativistic plasmas; Schaefer-Rolffs and Tautz [16] carried out a comparative study of relativistic Weibel instability for four EDF models specific to astrophysical plasmas.
In the present work, the analysis of the quasi-static relativistic EM modes in laser-heated plasmas is presented. In laboratory plasmas, it is linked to the progress in laser technology with the advent of powerful laser pulses. As mentioned above, it is now possible to create plasmas with extreme temperatures and densities. At such temperatures, the electron rest energy of electrons, mc^{2}, is no longer negligible with respect to their thermal energy ∼k_{B}T, where m is the electron rest mass, c is the speed of light, k_{B} is the Boltzmann constant and T is the electron temperature. Transport phenomena [3], parametric instabilities [5] as well as EM instabilities should be revisited in this relativistic regime.
This work is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we present the kinetic model used for the background EDF. Section III is devoted to the dispersion relation of EM waves and in Sec. IV, the electrical conductivity, the dissipation and the growth rate of the EM instability are calculated. Finally, we present in Sec. V, concluding remarks.
II. KINETIC MODEL FOR THE BACKGROUND PLASMA
In order to specify the validity of our kinetic model, we present in Fig. 1, the domain of validity for the kinetic models in the p02/m^{2}c^{2},p02/pth2 plane, where p_{0}=eE_{0}/ω_{0} is the electron momentum of oscillation in the laser electric field, e is the elementary charge, E_{0} and ω_{0} are, respectively, the amplitude and the frequency of the laser electric field, and pth2=p^{2}¯ is the statistical mean value of the square of electron momentum. The area is subdivided into four regions I-IV. Regions I and IV defined by p02pth2>1 correspond to the strongly nonlinear regime. The regions III and IV defined by p02/m^{2}c^{2}>1 correspond to the regime of a very intense laser field. In this regime, the oscillation of electrons in the laser electric field is relativistic. In contrast, this relativistic oscillation is negligible in regions I and II. In region I (p02m^{2}c^{2}<1,p02pth2>1), both isotropic and anisotropic parts of the EDF are affected nonlinearly by the laser field [17–19]. In region II (p02m^{2}c^{2}<1,p02pth2<1), the anisotropic part of the distribution function depends linearly on p02 i.e., F_{an∼}p02. For the isotropic part F_{0}, its behavior is governed by the relevant Langdon parameter a=Zp02pth2, where Z is the ion number charge. If a<1, then F_{0} is very close to the Maxwell-Boltzmann-Jüttner (MBJ) equilibrium function. On the other hand, if a≫1, F_{0} is deformed by the laser field [20,21].
In region III (p02m^{2}c^{2}>1,p02pth2<1), in addition to the deformation of the EDF by the laser field as in region II, one has to take into account the electron relativistic oscillation in the laser electric field. In region IV (p02m^{2}c^{2}>1,p02pth2>1), the full relativistic treatment of the kinetic equation has to be considered. To specify the domain of validity of our model, we also give a numerical example with an ion charge number Z=10, represented by the curve a=10p02pth2=1. Thus, in region II, above this curve, the Langdon effects are significant.
Note that our work concerns only the linear regime on p02, and therefore it is restricted to a part of region II defined by a<1. For the numerical presented above with Z=10, this region corresponds in Fig. 1 to region A. It has also been assumed that the spatial dimension L_{laser} of the plasma area illuminated by the laser wave, typically of the order of a few hundred microns, is greater than the spatial dimension of the quasi-static EM modes represented by its wavelength λ=2π/k, where k is the wavenumber. In our work, this hypothesis is largely verified.
Let us consider homogeneous relativistic plasmas in the presence of a laser electric field. The EDF fp→,t is governed by the Vlasov-Landau equation
where p→ is the relativistic momentum vector, γ=1+pmc{2} is the Lorentz factor, E→{h} and B→{h} are, respectively, the high-frequency electric and magnetic fields of the laser wave. On the right hand side of Eq. (1), the respective terms are the electron-electron and electron-ion collision operators. The evolution of the EDF in the momentum space is therefore governed without transport processes (homogenous plasmas), but only by electron-electron and electron-ion collisions, and the inverse bremsstrahlung absorption. It is supposed that the electric field is linearly polarized, E→{h}=ReE_{0}expiω_{0}te→{x}, e→{x} is a unit vector along the x-axis, and ions due to their high inertia are assumed to be at rest. In addition, we suppose the dipole approximation fulfilled; this means that the local approximation kL_{laser}≫1 is always verified, where L_{laser} is the typical spatial dimension of the laser-plasma area interaction.
To solve Eq. (1), one assumes that the EDF can be split into slow (low-frequency) and fast (high-frequency, denoted hereafter by the subscript “h”) varying parts, respectively,
where Fp→,t is the homogeneous background EDF which evolves in time on the hydrodynamic time-scale and f_{h}p→,t is the high-frequency EDF part induced by the laser electric field with the same time-dependence, i.e., f_{h}p→,t=Ref_{hc}expiω_{0}t. Thus, the kinetic equation can also be separated into these two time-scales, and from Eqs. (1) and (2), we readily deduce the following low- and high-frequency kinetic equations respectively,
The brackets in Eq. (3) indicate the average over the high-frequency field period T=2π/ω_{0}. Equations (3) and (4) were derived under some approximations. First, the Lorentz approximation was used, i.e., the electron-electron collision operator, which scales as C_{ee}/C_{ei}∼1/Z, is neglected. Second, we restrict our analysis to the laser intensity range, I_{0}≤10^{16}W/cm^{2}, used in the ICF schemes. At such intensities, electrons are randomly heated to moderate relativistic temperatures, but their oscillating motion in the electric field is still nonrelativistic, i.e., p_{0}≪mc. In this case, we can neglect, in Eqs. (3) and (4), the contribution of the magnetic B→{h}. In order to calculate the background EDF Fp→,t, we have to solve Eq. (4) for f_{h}. The iterative method can be used if the laser frequency is greater than the electron-ion collision frequency, ω_{0}≫ν_{ei} and we obtain
Then, substituting expression (5) into Eq. (3), and taking the time average over the high-frequency electric field cycle, we get
where the electron-ion collision operator reads
with νeip=Γ{ei}γm2p^{3}, Γ^{ei}=Zne^{4}lnΛ4πε02, n being the electron density, lnΛ the electron-ion Coulomb logarithm, and ε_{0} the vacuum permittivity. We should note that lnΛ deviates from the classical expression, and typically, its values range from 10 to 20 [22]. For solving Eq. (6), it is suitable to expand the EDF Fp→ on the Legendre polynomial basis P_{l}μ, i.e., Fp,μ=∑l=0∞2l+1P{l}μF_{l}p, where μ=p_{x}/p. After some algebra, we get the following equation for the component F_{l}:
Equation (8) stands only for the anisotropic part of the kinetic equation l≥1. On the left hand side, the first term can be neglected (stationary plasma approximation) and the second one is the electron-ion collision term, which tends to reduce the anisotropies. The right hand side stands for the inverse bremsstrahlung absorption contribution, and it represents the source term for the anisotropies. We assume that the isotropic component of the EDF is governed by the MBJ distribution function
where β=nz_{0}4πmc{3}K_{2}z_{0} and K_{ν}z_{0} is the νth-order Bessel function of the second kind, and its argument stands for z_{0}=mc^{2}k_{B}T called hereafter the relativistic parameter. We just recall that assumption (9) is valid if in the isotropic part of the kinetic equation, the electron-electron collisions are more important than the inverse bremsstrahlung absorption contribution, and this implies that the condition Zp02pth2<1 has to be fulfilled.
III. DISPERSION RELATION
Let us now derive the dispersion relation of small amplitude low-frequency EM modes in laser heated plasmas. For this, the plasma is separated into a homogeneous unperturbed state, represented by the EDF, fp→,t=Fp→,t+f_{h}p→,t and an inhomogeneous perturbed state represented by the EDF δfr→,p→,t. The plasma is thus described by the total EDF f_{t}r→,p→,t=Fp→,t+f_{h}p→,t+δfr→,p→,t which obeys the following Vlasov-Landau equation:
where δE→ and δB→ represent here the low-frequency EM fields. In Eq. (10), electron-electron collisions and the high-frequency magnetic field were neglected. We consider that the EM mode is defined by the frequency ω, such that ωkc≪1. It propagates along the Oz-direction k→=ke→{z}, and its polarization is defined as δE→=δEe→{x} and δB→=δBe→{y}. Here again, due to the separation of the time scales, we split Eq. (10) into a linear low-frequency part
and a high-frequency part
where in Eq. (11), S_{IB}=δeE→{h}·∂f_{h}∂p→ accounts for the inverse bremsstrahlung absorption. Equation (12) can be solved iteratively assuming the following ordering: ω_{0}f_{h}≫ν_{ei}f_{h},ω_{c}f_{h}, where ω_{c}=eδB⟨γ⟩m is the mean electron cyclotron frequency and ⟨γ⟩ is the mean value of the Lorentz factor in an equilibrium plasma. After some algebra, we get
Then, we can deduce the collisional absorption term performing the time-average over the high-frequency period obtaining
Smaller second order terms proportional to δfδE and δfδB were neglected in Eq. (14). Let us now work in the Fourier space ω↔t,k↔z. Substituting expression (14) into Eq. (11), it results in the perturbed low-frequency equation
where the notation “∼” refers to the perturbed quantities written in the Fourier space. The right hand side of Eq. (15) accounts for source terms, respectively, proportional to δẼ
and δB̃
Equation (15) can be further simplified assuming that the relevant parameter α=p02m^{2}c^{2} is small α≪1. Under this condition, first we can neglect the last term on the left hand side of Eq. (15) with respect to the collisional term C_{ei}δf, and similarly, in expression (16), the second term can be neglected. Second, the analysis of the background EDF Fp→ in Eq. (8) shows that its isotropic part F_{0} given by Eq. (9) is greater than the anisotropic part F_{an}, since F_{an} scales as α. Thus, in the first term of S_{E} and S_{B,} we keep only the contribution of F_{0}, the remaining terms being less important. Also, let us note that the second term of S_{B} corresponds to the source term of EM instability. Its contribution is due only to the anisotropic part F_{an}, since it vanishes for any isotropic EDF. Finally, Eq. (15) reduces to
where
To derive the dispersion relation of quasi-static EM modes, Eq. (18) has to be coupled to Faraday's equation δE→̃=−ωk→k^{2}∧δB→̃ and Ampere's equation k→∧δB→̃=iμ_{0}∫p→γmδf̃dp→ where the displacement current was neglected and μ_{0} is the vacuum permeability. To solve Eq. (18), the procedure adopted here is similar to that used in a previous work [23] based on the orthogonal polynomial expansion and the use of the continued fractions. Following this method, first we expand δf̃ and Eq. (18) on the spherical harmonic basis δf̃=∑l,mδf_{l,m}pY_{l,m}θ,φ, where θ and φ are the polar and azimuthal angles of the momentum vector p,→ such that cosθ=p_{x}/p
Second, with the use of the continued fractions, we solve Eq. (20), and after some mathematical developments, we obtain the expression of first anisotropic components of the distribution function relevant to the computation of the current density
where the continued fractions are defined by the following recursive formula:
Using the Faraday's and Ampere's equations coupled to Eq. (21), we obtain the desired dispersion relation of EM in relativistic laser-heated plasmas
Here, ω_{p}=ne^{2}mε_{0} is the electron plasma frequency, λ_{ei}=kB2T^{2}/Γ^{ei} is the electron mean free path and the functions Gk,z_{0} and S_{w}k,z_{0} are, respectively, given by
and
Here, we have used the normalized components of the background EDF, F¯{l}=F_{l}/β. We just mention that the first term in the integral of Eq. (25) is proportional to the second anisotropic function F_{2}, which corresponds at the macroscopic level to the anisotropic temperatures T_{x},T_{⊥}.
IV. DAMPING AND GROWTH RATES OF EM MODES
In this section, we analyze the dispersion relation (23). First of all, we emphasize that this dispersion relation is valid in the whole collisionality range. Therefore, the Knudsen number kλ_{ei} could take any arbitrary values. We focus our attention on quasi-static EM modes defined by small phase velocities, i.e., ωkc≪ 1. For a real wavenumber k, Eq. (23) gives a purely imaginary complex frequency, i.e. Γ=Imω, which reads
Equation (26) exhibits two terms corresponding, respectively, to the dissipation and the instability source term that could be driven by plasma anisotropy. These two terms are studied separately in Secs. IV A and IV B.
A. Dissipation of the EM modes
The dissipation term [first term in Eq. (26)] can be explicitly written with the use of expression (24) as
We can see that it is described by the isotropic background EDF F_{0}p to account for the dispersion in the momentum space. It also depends on the Knudsen number kλ_{ei} which determines the physical mechanisms responsible for the dissipation. Two mechanisms are concerned, the electron-ion collisions and the Landau electron-wave resonance. The first mechanism is predominant for typical scale lengths L∼1/k much greater than the electron mean free path (L ≫λ_{ei}). In the collisionless range L ≪ λ_{ei}, the leading mechanism is the second one when the contribution of collisions is no longer important.
We present in Fig. 2, the dissipation term D as a function of kλ_{ei}. We emphasize that in the collisional range kλ_{ei}≪1, it is the diffusive behavior that is relevant since D∼kλei{2}, and the magnetic field diffuses in the plasma due to the electron-ion collisions. By increasing kλ_{ei}, the diffusion becomes less important and further physical effects take place. The particle-wave interactions begin to be important, and their contributions coexist with the electron-ion collisions. For kλ_{ei}>1, the EM modes are mainly damped by the Landau mechanism. In the limit kλ_{ei}≫1, a purely collisionless regime occurs and the EM damping rate is governed by the scaling law D∼kλei{3}. Hence, Eq. (27) exhibits a continuous transition from the collisional to the collisionless limits. We can see that there is a similarity between the collisionless damping rate (27) and the damping rate of ion acoustic waves. Indeed, we recall that the standard damping rate of ion acoustic waves includes the contribution of ions and electrons, respectively, in the high and low phase velocity ranges. As for the low-frequency EM modes of the present work, the low-frequency part in the ion acoustic wave damping rate scales as ∼k^{3}. We emphasize that the numerical calculation of the continued fractions is performed with standard numerical algorithms. The order of truncation is governed by an accuracy test. The one used is to compare the value of the calculated fraction at order n and n+1. If H_{l}n−H_{l}n+1H_{l}n<10^{−6}, the accuracy is considered sufficient. Typically, for kλei{2}∼1, we found that the order n to reach the desired precision is about few thousands.
Let us now calculate the electrical conductivity σkλ_{ei},z_{0} as a function of the collisionality parameter kλ_{ei} and the relativistic parameter z_{0}. From Eq. (21), we calculate the current density δj_{x}̃=−e2π3∫0∞p^{3}γmδf_{1,1}−δf_{1,−1}dp. Keeping only the electric field source, i.e., δj_{x}̃∼δẼ=σδẼ, we readily deduce the electrical conductivity
where τ=m^{2}c^{3}/Γ^{ei}. From the results displayed in Fig. 2 and the dissipation function given by Eq. (27), it is straightforward to deduce that in the collisional limit, the conductivity σkλ_{ei} tends asymptotically to a constant value and that it scales as 1kinthecollisionlesslimit. We give in Figs. 3 and 4, the electrical conductivity as a function of z_{0} for three values of Knudsen number kλ_{ei} corresponding to a strong and an intermediate collisionality, and to the collisionless regime.
In Fig. 3, the conductivity was normalized by Spitzer-Härm conductivity [25], i.e., σ¯k=σk/ne^{2}τ{ei}m322π, where τ_{ei} = λ_{ei}/v_{t} is the electron-ion collision time and v_{t}=k_{B}T/m is the thermal velocity. The normalized conductivity, σ¯, accounts for the purely relativistic effects included in the parameter z_{0}, together with the nonlocal effects included in the continued fraction H_{1}. We should notice that the Spitzer-Härm conductivity σ=ne^{2}τ{ei}m322π used for the normalization can be readily deduced from Eq. (28). This limit is recovered using the asymptotic limit of the Bessel function K_{2}z_{0}≫1≈π2z_{0}exp−z_{0}, the nonrelativistic approximation γ≈1−v^{2}/2c{2}, and the collisional approximation for the continued fraction H_{1}=1/2.
It appears that σ¯ increases with increasing z_{0} whatever the collisionality regime, and it tends to a constant value in the nonrelativistic regime. We remark that by increasing kλ_{ei} (higher nonlocal effects), the nonrelativistic regime (asymptotic constant value) is reached for smaller values of z_{0}. In addition, the nonlocal effects tend to reduce the conductivity, and this reduction is approximately uniform in the whole z_{0}-range. We pointed out that similar results were derived for σ¯ in Ref [24] for the arbitrary plasma ionization state and in strongly collisional plasmas. We have checked that in the range kλ_{ei}≪1, the present model recovered exactly the same normalized conductivity results as in Ref [24].
The behavior of electrical conductivity σ is presented in Fig. 4. We can see that in contrast to the normalized conductivity, σ decreases with increasing z_{0}. This means that the first factor ne^{2}τ{ei}m proportional to T^{3/2} (or z0−3/2) is the relevant factor as compared to σ¯, and thus, it imposes a decrease of the conductivity as z_{0} increases. In summary, for a fixed relativistic parameter z_{0,} the nonlocal effects tend to reduce the conductivity, and for a fixed Knudsen number kλ_{ei}, the relativistic effects tend to increase the conductivity.
Let us now investigate the asymptotic expressions of conductivity (28) in the collisional and collisionless limits and in a weakly nonlocal approximation.
(i) In the collisional limit kλ_{ei}≪1, the continued fraction is truncated at the lowest order obtaining H_{1}=12, and the expression of the local conductivity can be written as
We have checked that Eqs. (28) and (29) yield the same results within 1% for kλ_{ei}<10^{−2}. We should note that the integral in Eq. (29) can be expressed as a function of the well-known exponential integral E_{i}z_{0}.
(ii) In the collisionless limit kλ_{ei}≫1, after some algebra, we obtain for the continued fraction H_{1}=3π8γ^{2}γ2−1{2}1z02kλ_{ei}, and from Eq. (28), we get the following explicit expression for the collisionless conductivity
In Eq. (30), we note that we recover the dependence on 1k, which represents the signature of purely collisionless effects, as shown in Refs [26] and  [27]. Here, we pointed out that the electrical dissipation is due only to the resonant particles through the Landau wave-particle interaction. In Fig. 2, the results for kλ_{ei}=10^{3} is accurately recovered by Eq. (30). Further simplifications can be found in the ultrarelativistic limit, and we get
(iii) Let us now study the weakly nonlocal effects on the electrical conductivity. We perform the Taylor expansion at the first order of the continued fraction H_{1} defined by Eq. (22) with respect to a small Knudsen number kλei{2}≪1
Inserting this expression in Eq. (28), we calculate the following weakly nonlocal conductivity:
where I_{0}=∫1∞γ2−1{3}γ^{2}exp−z_{0}γdγ and I_{1}=∫1∞γ2−1{7}γ^{6}exp−z_{0}γdγ. In the x-space, the current density can be written as
where the exponential term is a delocalization kernel and λ_{del}=λ_{ei}z0415I_{1}I_{0} is the delocalization length of conductivity. Equation (34) means that the current density at position x depends on its value in a sphere of radius λ_{del}, and this gives this transport term a nonlocal character. We have calculated numerically the delocalization length and, e.g., for z_{0}=50, we get λ_{del}≈11λ_{ei}.
In the approximation of a small amplitude laser electric field p02pth2≪1, non-linear effects may appear in the isotropic distribution function F_{0,} [20] when the condition Zp02pth2>1 is satisfied. In the extreme case where Zp02pth2≫1, this function behaves like a super-Gaussian proportional to exp−v^{5}vc5, where v_{c} is a characteristic velocity. This result of Langdon [20] was obtained in the non-relativistic case. In the weakly relativistic case z_{0}=100, this result can be used to estimate the Langdon effect on the electrical conductivity in the strongly collisional boundary kλ_{ei}≪1. We found σ¯=12.76 and σ¯=11.64 for a Maxwellian and the super-Gaussian distribution function, respectively. This result shows that the Langdon effect does not significantly modify the conductivity. One expects that this effect will also be negligible in the relativistic regime.
B. Stability analysis of the quasi-static EM modes
Let us now turn to the stability analysis of the EM modes. For this, we expand the second term in Eq. (26) as follows:
This analysis requires to account for the collisional-Landau damping rate (first term), the saturation term (second term), and the driven term (third term) in Eq. (35). These terms compete to produce damped or unstable growing modes. The source term in Eq. (35) depends on the second anisotropic component F_{2}.
To estimate the growth rate, let us first calculate explicitly the relevant component of the EDF F_{2}. From Eq. (8), we can see that the anisotropic components F_{l} are described by an infinite set of coupled equations. Each equation at an arbitrary order l includes three components F_{l−2}, F_{l}, and F_{l+2}. In addition, the strength of each term F_{l} is given by p0mc{2}. Let us consider that p0mc{2}≪1, as mentioned above. We can solve the set of equations for F_{0}, F_{2} and F_{4} by eliminating the other components and by using the ordering F_{2l}∼p0mc{2l} with l=0−2, to finally obtain the second anisotropy
In the most general case, the integral in Eq. (35) is not analytically tractable and the numerical approach is required to solve this equation. We have calculated numerically the imaginary part of the frequency given by Eq. (26) using standard numerical methods.
In Fig. 5, we presented the growth rate Γ for the relevant parameter α=2×10{−3}, the ion charge number Z=10, the density n=10^{21}cm^{−3}, and for different relativistic parameters z_{0}=30, z_{0}=50, and z_{0}=100. We notice that we have checked numerically that the relativistic effects became non-negligible for z_{0}<100. We can see that the relativistic effects tend to slightly stabilize the EM modes, since Fig. 5 shows small decreasing growth rates of EM modes with significantly decreasing z_{0}. In particular, for the maximum growth rate, we obtained Γ_{max}z_{0}=100≈2×Γ{max}z_{0}=30 and Γ_{max}z_{0}=100≈1.3×Γ{max}z_{0}=50. As a result, the growth rates are still sufficiently high (greater than 5×10{10}s^{−1}) in a mildly relativistic range. For the most unstable modes, the optimum wavenumbers are included in the collisionless range. This can be explained by the weak contribution of the Landau damping as a stabilizing mechanism. In contrast, damping due to the electron-ion collisions is very efficient in the collisional range (kλ_{ei}≪1), and as a result, in this spectral range, the EM modes are totally stabilized.
In Fig. 6, we consider the physical situation where the EM wave propagates in an underdense plasma. We can see that the growth rate does not decrease significantly with decreasing electron densities. In particular, for the critical density n_{c1}=10^{21}cm^{−3} and the underdense density n_{c2}=10^{19}cm^{−3}, the maximum growth rate decreases by a factor of about 7. This is due to the dependence of the damping term and the source term with respect to the electron density. These two terms are proportional to n^{2} and n, respectively, and for decreasing n, the growth rate of the most unstable mode decreases moderately. In addition, the optimum wavenumber corresponding to the maximum growth rate increases roughly as the ratio of the square roots of densities, i.e., n_{c1}n_{c2}.
We note that as for the electrical conductivity in the case where the plasma is weakly relativistic, we have performed the stability analysis of the EM modes using the asymptotic isotropic distribution function of Langdon [20] for Zp02pth2≫1. We found that the growth rate Γ increases slightly by about a factor of 2. Thus, we expect that in this regime, Zp02pth2≫1 and p02pth2<1, the contribution of the inverse bremsstrahlung absorption should not be relevant for lower values of z_{0}.
V. CONCLUSION
A semi-collisional dispersion relation of EM modes in anisotropic plasmas, valid in the arbitrary relativistic regime, is derived. This relation describes the dispersion, the damping or the amplification of EM modes from the collisional range governed by electron-ion collisions to the collisionless one dominated by the Landau particle-wave interactions. Electron-electron collisions were neglected, and this restricts the analysis to plasmas with high atomic numbers Z≫1. Even though the dispersion relation is valid for arbitrary phase velocities, we focused on the low-frequency part of the spectrum by investigating the properties of quasi-static EM modes. The plasma anisotropy considered in this work is defined in the momentum space by an EDF with a cylindrical symmetry, i.e., Fp,p_{x}.
The dissipation term in the dispersion relation is studied as a function of the Knudsen number kλ_{ei} in the whole collisionality regime. It has been shown that in the collisional range, this term scales as ∼kλei{2}, whereas in the collisionless one, it scales as ∼kλei{3}. From the magnetic field equation, the relativistic semi-collisional electrical conductivity σ((kλei){2},z_{0}) was derived. In the collisional range, we recover the results reported in the literature, and in the collisionless limit, we propose an explicit expression for the conductivity. In addition, a nonlocal formula is calculated in the weakly nonlocal approximation. The stability analysis of EM modes in mildly relativistic plasmas relevant in near future experiments of inertial confinement fusion is presented. It is found that high growth rates are driven by the temperature anisotropy induced by collisional absorption. These strong magnetic fields are mainly collisionless, and thus their scale lengths are smaller than the electron mean free path. It is found that the most growing modes depend weakly on the plasma density and the relativistic effects. These fields could prevent the heating of the inner layer of the target by inhibiting the thermal transport of the laser energy deposited near the critical surface. The contribution of the inverse bremsstrahlung absorption to both the isotropic [20] and anisotropic [17] parts of the EDF and the electrical conductivity will be presented in a future work.
