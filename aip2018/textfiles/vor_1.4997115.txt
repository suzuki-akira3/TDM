Galilean generalized Robertson-Walker spacetimes: A new family of Galilean geometrical models
We introduce a new family of Galilean spacetimes, the Galilean generalized Robertson-Walker spacetimes. This new family is relevant in the context of a generalized Newton-Cartan theory. We study its geometrical structure and analyse the completeness of its inextensible free falling observers. This sort of spacetimes constitutes the local geometric model of a much wider family of spacetimes admitting certain conformal symmetry. Moreover, we find some sufficient geometric conditions which guarantee a global splitting of a Galilean spacetime as a Galilean generalized Robertson-Walker spacetime.
I. INTRODUCTION
General relativity is so far the most accurate and successful theory to describe the spacetime structure and the gravitational phenomena. The evolution of the universe on a large scale was aptly described in the first half of the 20th century by means of the Robertson-Walker cosmological models (or fairly, Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker models). These models assume that the matter distribution and the “space relative to the family of observers commovil with the matter” are homogeneous and isotropic. These hypotheses may be weakened in order to describe a universe in a more accurate scale. With this objective, much more recently, new cosmological models have been introduced, as the Generalized Robertson-Walker (GRW) spacetimes [2]. This kind of relativistic spacetimes has been intensively studied from a mathematical perspective (see, for instance, Refs [5],  [9],  [11],  [15], and  [16]).
However, the geometric formulation of the Newtonian’s gravitation, first postulated by Cartan [7,8], after the appearance of the Einstein’s general relativity theory, is still of interest and significant for several reasons.
On one hand, it formulates the classical Newtonian gravitation as a covariant theory and shows that certain results previously considered as the characteristic or singular of the theory of relativity are shared by the (geometric) gravitational Newton-Cartan theory. In fact, the Newtonian gravity also arises as a consequence of the curvature of a connection in the spacetime, which does not come from any semi-Riemannian metric. Moreover, in the geometric formulation of Newtonian’s gravity theory, the spacetime structure is dynamical in the sense that it participates in the unfolding of physics rather than being a fixed backdrop against which it unfolds (see Ref [12] and classical references therein).
On the other hand, it allows us to establish from an accurate and intrinsic way the limit relation between the Newtonian theory of gravitation and general relativity.
The notion of symmetry is clearly basic in physics. On a geometrical spacetime model, symmetry is usually based on the assumption of the existence of a one-parameter group of transformations generated by a Killing vector field or, more generally, by a conformal vector field (see Ref [18]). Another important question is that a geometric approach enables possible generalizations of Newtonian theory, via the assumption of certain symmetries on Galilean spacetimes (see Sec. II), which are the geometrical “arena” for the Newton-Cartan gravitation. So, in Ref [13], the author studies the symmetry imposed on a Galilean spacetime by the cosmological principle, obtaining the Galilean model analogous to the relativistic Robertson-Walker spacetimes.
In this work, we introduce a new family of Galilean geometrical models, which generalize the non-relativistic Robertson-Walker spacetimes, in the same way as GRW spacetimes generalize the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker spacetimes: the Galilean Generalized Robertson-Walker (GGRW) spacetimes (Sec. III). A GGRW spacetime possesses an infinitesimal symmetry given by the existence of a time-like irrotational conformally Leibnizian (ICL) vector field. Several geometrical properties and physical interpretations for this family of spacetimes are given in Sec. III, as the possible existence of singularities or the completeness of its free falling observers. Section IV is devoted to the study of Galilean spacetimes admitting a time-like irrotational conformally Leibnizian vector field. We show that an ICL Galilean spacetime must be locally a GGRW spacetime. Finally, Sec. V is devoted to face the following kind of splitting problems: under what geometrical assumptions an ICL spacetime globally decomposes as a GGRW spacetime.
II. SETUP
Recall that a Leibnizian structure on a (non-relativistic) spacetime M (smooth connected manifold of any dimension m = n + 1 ≥ 2) is a pair (Ω, g) consisting of a differential 1-form Ω ∈ Λ^{1}(M), nowhere null (Ω_{p} ≠ 0, ∀p ∈ M) and a positive definite metric g on its kernel. Specifically, let us denote by An(Ω) = {v ∈ TM, Ω(v) = 0} the smooth n-distribution induced on M by Ω. If we denote by Γ(TM) the set of smooth vector fields on M, we may construct the subset Γ(An(Ω)) = {V ∈ Γ(TM)/V_{q} ∈ An(Ω), ∀p ∈ M}. So, the map
is smooth, bilinear, symmetric, and positive definite. Hence, M is endowed with a sub-Riemannian structure defined on the bundle An(Ω), i.e., the annihilator of the degenerate metric Ω ⊗Ω (see Refs [3] and  [4] for details). The triad (M,Ω,g). is called Leibnizian spacetime.
Points of M are usually called events. The Euclidean vector space (An(Ω_{p}), g_{p}) is called the absolute space at p ∈ M, and the linear form Ω_{p} is the absolute clock at p. A tangent vector v ∈ T_{p}M is named space-like if Ω_{p}(v) = 0, and otherwise, time-like. Additionally, if Ω_{p}(v) > 0 (respectively, Ω_{p}(v) < 0), v points out the future (respectively, the past).
An observer in a Leibnizian spacetime M is a time-like future unit smooth curve γ: J → M, i.e., its velocity γ′ satisfies that Ω(γ′(s)) = 1 for all s ∈ J. The parameter s is called the proper time of the observer γ. A vector field Z ∈ Γ(TM) with Ω(Z) = 1 is called a field of observers, that is, its integral curves are observers.
When the smooth distribution An(Ω) is integrable (equivalently, if the absolute clock Ω satisfies Ω ∧ dΩ = 0), the Leibnizian spacetime (M, Ω, g) is said to be locally synchronizable, and making use of the Frobenius theorem (see Ref [17]), it may be foliated by a family of space-like hypersurfaces {F_{λ}}. In this case, it is well-known that each p ∈ M has a neighbourhood where Ω = f dt, for certain smooth functions f > 0, t, and the hypersurfaces {t = constant} locally coincide with a leaf of the foliation F. Thus, any observer may be synchronized through the “compromise time” t, obtained rescaling its proper time. In the more restrictive case dΩ = 0, the Leibnizian spacetime (M, Ω, g) is called proper time locally synchronizable, and one has, locally, Ω = dt. Now, observers are synchronized directly by its proper time (up to a constant). When Ω is exact, Ω = dt for some function t ∈ C^{∞}(M), which is called the absolute time function. In this case, any observer may be assumed to be parametrized by t. Notice that the notion of (local and local proper time) synchronizability is intrinsic to the Leibnizian structure, applicable for every observer, in contrast to the relativistic setting, where the analogous concepts have meanings only for fields of observers.
According to Ref [4], a field of observers is called Leibnizian if the stages Φ_{s} of its local flows are Leibnizian diffeomorphisms, that is, they preserve the absolute clock and space, i.e.,
On the other hand, the inertia principle must be codified through a connection on the spacetime. However, a Leibnizian structure has no canonical affine connection associated. Then, it is required to introduce a compatible connection with the absolute clock Ω and the space metric g, i.e., a connection ∇ such that
(a) ∇Ω = 0 (equivalently, Ω(∇_{X}Y) = X(Ω(Y)) for any X, Y ∈ Γ(TM)),
(b) ∇g = 0 [i.e., Z(g(V, W)) = g(∇_{Z}V, W) + g(∇_{Z}W, V) for any Z ∈ Γ(TM) and V, W space-like vector fields].Such a connection is named Galilean. A Galilean spacetime (M, Ω, g, ∇) is a Leibnizian spacetime endowed with a Galilean connection ∇. In addition, ∇ is said symmetric if its torsion vanishes identically (Tor_{∇}(X, Y) = ∇_{X}Y − ∇_{Y}X − [X, Y] ≡ 0). From a physical point of view, a symmetric connection is desirable since it is completely determined by its geodesics, i.e., by the free falling observers of M. From now on, we will only consider symmetric Galilean connections on the spacetime.
Given two Galilean spacetimes (M, Ω, g, ∇) and (M′, Ω′, g′, ∇′), a diffeomorphism F: M → M′ is said to be Galilean if F*Ω′ = Ω, F*g′ = g, and F*∇′ = ∇, i.e., ∇dF(X)′dF(Y)=∇_{X}Y.
For each fixed field of observers Z on a Galilean spacetime (M, Ω, g, ∇), the gravitational field induced by ∇ in Z is given by the space-like vector field G=∇_{Z}Z. The vorticity or Coriolis field of Z is the 2-form ω(Z)=12Rot(Z), defined as
The main result of Ref [4], Theorem 5.27, claims that, for a fixed field of observers Z on a Leibnizian spacetime (M, Ω, g) with dΩ = 0, the set of all symmetric Galilean connections is bijectively mapped onto Γ(TM),Λ^{2}(An(Ω)). Each symmetric Galilean connection ∇ is mapped to G(Z),Rot(Z). Thus, the gravitational field and the vorticity of a field of observers determine a unique symmetric Galilean geometry of the spacetime.
Additionally, a Leibnizian field of observers Z in a Galilean spacetime (M, Ω, g, ∇) is named Galilean if it is affine for ∇, that is, L_{Z}∇=0, where L denotes the Lie derivative. Finally, a Galilean spacetime is said Newtonian if the (symmetric) connection ∇ restricted to the space-like vectors is flat, and it admits an irrotational Galilean field of observers. This kind of spacetimes has traditionally represented the classical (non-relativistic) geometric model of gravity.
III. GALILEAN GENERALIZED ROBERTSON-WALKER SPACETIMES
In this section, we introduce a new family of Galilean geometric models, which are the classical version of the relativistic generalized Robertson-Walker spacetimes defined in Ref [2].
Definition 1. LetI⊆Rbe a real interval, (F, h) be an n-dimensional connected Riemannian manifold, and f ∈ C^{∞}(I) be a smooth positive function on I. A Galilean spacetime (M, Ω, g, ∇) is called the Galilean Generalized Robertson-Walker (GGRW) spacetime if M = I × F, Ω = dπ_{I}, g is the restriction to the bundle An(Ω) of the following (degenerate) metric on M:
where π_{I}, π_{F}are the canonical projections onto the open interval I and the fiber F, respectively, and ∇ is the only symmetric Galilean connection on M such that
where ∂_{t} = ∂/∂t is the global coordinate vector field associated with t ≔ π_{I}.The vector field ∂_{t} defines a field of observers in M (Ω(∂_{t}) = 1), which we will call commovil observers, by the similarity with the relativistic Robertson-Walker spacetimes. Then, the conditions (2) in the above definition mean that the commovil observers are free falling and they do not rotate. Notice that from Ref [4], Theorem 5.27, the conditions (2) determine the (symmetric) Galilean connection on M.
Example 2. Let us consider a GGRW withI=RandF=R^{n}endowed with the usual Euclidean metric. If f(t) = constant, then the Galilean connection coincides with the standard flat connection of the affine spaceR^{n+1}. In addition, the commovil observers satisfy the necessary conditions to assure the Newtonian character of this spacetime. More physically relevant examples are given in Sec. III A.
A. Some physical interpretations
Recall that a Leibnizian spacetime (M, Ω, g) [with integrable distribution An(Ω)] is said to be spatially homogeneous if for any p, q ∈ M located in the same leaf of the foliation, there exists a Leibnizian diffeomorphism carrying p into q. Analogously, M is called spatially isotropic at an event p ∈ M if, for any space-like vectors v, w ∈ T_{p}M, there is a Leibnizian diffeomorphism ψ such that dψ∣_{p}(v) = w.
From a physical viewpoint, a GGRW spacetime can model a universe (large-scale) composed of matter (galaxies) only subjected to the proper gravity action. Their trajectories are identified with the integral curves of the geodesic vector field ∂_{t}.
The cosmological principle leads to a spatially homogeneous and isotropic universe, in such a way that its evolution is only produced by means of dilatations and contractions with scale factor f(t) depending only on the absolute time t. This situation is modeled by a (non-relativistic) Robertson-Walker spacetime, namely, a GGRW with fiber a Riemannian manifold F with constant sectional curvature (see [13]). However, although the hypothesis of spatial homogeneity and isotropy is reasonable as a first approximation to the large scale structure of the universe, it could not be appropriate when we consider a more accurate scale. This fact motives the introduction of this new family of Galilean spacetimes.
On the other hand, for each event p ∈ M, we may parametrize I × {p} by γ_{p}(t) = (t, p), being γ_{p} a commovil observer in ∂_{t}. Set q ∈ M, q ≠ p. The absolute distance between two instantaneous observers γ_{p} and γ_{q} in F_{t}={t}×F is given by the Riemannian distance between them in F_{t}. In particular, when f has a positive derivative, the “spaces F_{t} are expanding” (or, alternatively, the distance between commovil observers is increasing). Conversely, if f′ < 0, the separation between commovil observers is decreasing. When f(t) = 1 (or constant), the commovil observers are relatively static.
Notice that this family of spacetimes allows us to describe many scenarios. For instance, if we consider I=R, N compact, and f(t)=11+t^{2}, the commovil observers measure an expanding universe during the time interval (−∞, 0) and contracting for t ∈ (0, + ∞). There are no physical singularities, but the distances between two arbitrary observers can be arbitrarily small for |t| big enough.
But we can also find GGRW spacetimes with physical singularities. Indeed, consider I = (−a, a) and f(t)=a^{2}−t^{2}, a > 0. Since limt→±af(t)=0 and limt→±af^{′}(t)=∓∞, we deduce that the model has a Big Bang singularity at t = −a and a Big Crunch at t = a. The reader may compare this model with the spatially closed Friedmann models (Ref [14], Chap. 2).
In a Newtonian spacetime, the Poisson equation relates the density of mass of the universe with its intrinsic geometry, in an analogous way that Einstein equations in the relativistic setting,
Here, Ric is the Ricci tensor of ∇, G is the universal gravitational constant, and ϱ is the density of mass (the only source of the gravitational field).
If we admit that this equation is also true for the GGRW spacetimes, it is not difficult to obtain that
(i) (F, h) must be Ricci-flat,
(ii) Ric(∂_{t},∂_{t})=−nf^{″}f=4πGϱ.
Notice that, from (ii), we immediately deduce that density of mass ϱ must be constant at each instant, and the scale factor f must satisfy f″(t) ≤ 0 for all t ∈ I.
Corollary 3. If the Poisson equation holds in a GGRW spacetime and f is not constant, thenI≠R. In fact,
(i) if there exists t_{0} ∈ I such that f′(t_{0}) > 0, then −∞ < Inf(I),
(ii) if there exists t_{0} ∈ I such that f^{′}(t_{0}) < 0, then Sup(I) < ∞.Notice that this result implies that if a GGRW spacetime satisfies the above assumptions, then it is not geodesically complete (the integral curves of ∂_{t} cannot be complete), i.e., a Big Bang or a Big Crunch happens. We remark that this consequence is identical for the relativistic GRW spacetimes (see Ref [14], Chap. 12).
B. Completeness of free falling observers in a GGRW spacetime
We now proceed to analyze when the inextensible free falling trajectories in a GGRW spacetime are complete. Physically we are looking for geometric assumptions that guarantee that every free falling observer lives forever.
First, we obtain an analogous result to the geodesic normalization lemma in semi-Riemannian manifolds.
Lemma 4. Let γ be a geodesic in a GGRW spacetime. Then, Ω(γ′) is constant along the trajectory of γ.
Proof. Since ∇_{γ^{′}}γ^{′}=0, using the equality (a) included in Sec. II, it is directly obtained that 0=Ω(∇_{γ^{′}}γ^{′})=γ^{′}(Ω(γ^{′})).The relevant cases correspond with Ω(γ′) = 0 or 1. The first one (Ω(γ′) = 0) means that γ is space-like and contained in a leaf F_{t} of the foliation of Ω. As ∇ coincides with the Levi-Civita connection of (F_{t},f(t){2}h), the completeness of this kind of geodesics is equivalent to the geodesic completeness of (F, h). Thus, from now on, we will deal with the free falling observers [γ geodesic with Ω(γ′) = 1].
Theorem 5. A GGRW spacetime is geodesically complete if and only ifI=Rand the fiber (F, h) is (geodesically) complete.
Proof. Let γ(s) = (θ(s), σ(s)) be a free falling observer. Since Ω(γ′) = 1, we can write
where σ^{′}¯ is the horizontal lift of σ′ from F to M. Consequently, using that [∂_{t},W¯]=0, where W¯ is the horizontal lift of a vector field W on F extending to σ′, we get
Here we have also taken into account that ∇_{∂t}W¯ is a space-like vector and ∇_{∂t}W¯=f^{′}fW¯, as it may be easily checked.Since ∇_{σ^{′}¯}σ^{′}¯ is the horizontal lift of ∇σ^{′}hσ^{′} and taking into account that F is homothetic to each leaf of F (and homothecies preserve the connections), the completeness of Eq. (4) is equivalent to the completeness of
where ∇^{h} is the Levi-Civita connection of h. As f∈C^{∞}(R), a straightforward application of Ref [6], Theorem 2, gives the completeness of the inextensible solutions of the non-autonomous equation (5), and the proof is ended.
IV. IRROTATIONAL CONFORMALLY LEIBNIZIAN SPACETIMES
In this section, we present a wider family of Galilean spacetimes which locally exhibit the structure of a GGRW spacetime. As a previous step, we introduce the concept of conformally Leibnizian field of observers, generalizing the well-known notion of Leibnizian observer.
Definition 6. Let (M, Ω, g) be a Leibnizian spacetime. A vector field X is called a spatially conformally Leibnizian vector field if the Lie derivative of the absolute space metric is well defined and it satisfies
for some smooth function λ ∈ C^{∞}(M). If X additionally verifies
for the same conformal factor λ, then X is named conformally Leibnizian vector field.Note that a conformally Leibnizian vector field is Leibnizian if and only if the conformal factor λ is identically zero [4].
Remark 7. Condition (6) may be also expressed as
Analogously, assumption (7) is equivalent to
and means that distribution An(Ω) is invariant along the flow of vector field X. So, if this distribution is integrable, the flow of X carries each leaf of the foliation to another one.The following result shows that GGRW spacetimes admit a time-like conformally Leibnizian vector field.
Proposition 8. Let (M = I × F, Ω = dt, g, ∇) be a GGRW spacetime with scale factor f ∈ C^{∞}(I). Then, the vector field K ≔ (f ○ π_{I}) ∂_{t}is irrotational and conformally Leibnizian and, consequently, it satisfies the identity
Proof. Let V, W be space-like vector fields. A straightforward computation shows
Consider a fixed point (t_{0}, p) ∈ M, and v, w ∈ T_{p}F. Hence,
where η(s)=g∣_{(t0+s,p)}dΦ_{s}(0,v),dΦ_{s}(0,w), and Φ_{s}: M → M is the flow of the vector field ∂_{t}, (t, q) ↦ (t + s, q). Thus, dΦ_{s}(0, v) = (0, v) for all s∈R, and it follows that
As a consequence, we have
Finally, taking into account that V (f ○ π_{I}) = 0 for any space-like vector field, it holds that
and K is spatially conformally Leibnizian with conformal factor λ=f^{′}◦π_{I}.From (9) and the irrotational character of K, we obtain
Now let us consider X ∈ Γ(TM), which may be expressed at a point p as
where {vi}{i} is an orthonormal basis of An(Ω_{p}),g_{p}. Therefore,
Making use of ∇_{∂t}∂_{t}=0, some computations give
and we obtain (8). From this equality, the conformally Leibnizian character of K is easily deduced.
Definition 9. Let (M, Ω, g, ∇) be a Galilean spacetime, whose absolute clock is closed (dΩ = 0). If M admits a time-like vector field K ∈ Γ(TM) satisfying
M is called Irrotational Conformally Leibnizian (ICL) spacetime.
Remark 10. Notice that condition (10) directly implies that K is conformally Leibnizian and Rot(K)(V, W) = 0, for all space-like vector fields V, W.As a first consequence of Definition 9, we obtain that the functions Ω(K) and ρ are constant on each leaf of the foliation induced by Ω.
Lemma 11. Let (M, Ω, g, ∇) be an ICL spacetime with irrotational conformally Leibnizian vector field K and conformal factor ρ. Then
Proof. From equality (a) of Sec. II and (10), we have that
and ρ=KΩ(K)Ω(K), for any space-like vector field V ∈ Γ(An(Ω)). Finally, since [V, K] is space-like, we have
We have just seen that each GGRW is an ICL spacetime. Next theorem ensures that any ICL spacetime is locally a GGRW spacetime.
Theorem 12. Let (M, Ω, g, ∇) be an ICL spacetime. For each p ∈ M, there exist an open neighbourhood of p, U, and a Galilean diffeomorphismΨ:N→U, where N is a GGRW spacetime.
Proof. Consider K as a time-like irrotational conformally Leibnizian vector field. Let Z=1Ω(K)K be the field of observers associated with K, and let Φ_{s} be its (local) flow. Fixed a point p ∈ M, we take a neighbourhood U_{p} in the leaf F_{p} of the foliation induced by Ω passing through p. Consider I∈R, 0 ∈ I, a suitable interval such that the flow Φ_{s} is well-defined and one-to-one. Then, we may define the map
which satisfies
for all (s, q) ∈ I × U_{p} and v ∈ T_{p}U_{p}. Now, identifying π_{I} ≡ t and ∂_{t} ≡ (1, 0), we have
Taking into account that the flow of Z preserves Ω,
As a consequence, Ψ*Ω = dt, and each level set of t corresponds with certain open set U∩F_{a} of some leaf of the foliation F induced by Ω.On the other hand, condition (10) implies that K is conformally Leibnizian (see Remark 10) and making use of Lemma 11, we get
Now, let us consider v, w ∈ T_{p}U_{p}. The last equation may be rewritten as
where Φ_{s} denotes the (local) flow of Z.If we denote
and taking into account Lemma 11 and (11), the following differential equation holds:
Thus, defining the function
we conclude that Ψ*g = f^{2}(t) g_{p}, i.e., the induced metric on I × U_{p} is like (1), with h = g_{p} and scale factor equal to (12).Finally, we check that Z is an irrotational and geodesic vector field. From (10),
for all V, W ∈ Γ(An(Ω)). By using Lemma 11, a straightforward computation gives that ∇_{Z}Z = 0. Since there is only one connection ∇ on M, it must be the induced one by means of Ψ, (Ψ−1){*}∇^{GGRW}, from the GGRW spacetime
Therefore, Ψ is a Galilean diffeomorphism, and the proof is complete.
V. GLOBAL GGRW DECOMPOSITIONS
We know that an ICL spacetime is locally a GGRW spacetime. Now, our aim here consists in looking for additional assumptions on the geometry of an ICL spacetime which lead to a global splitting as a GGRW spacetime. This type of question has been yet discussed several times in the relativistic setting (see, for instance, Refs [5],  [10],  [11], and  [1]), i.e., under what conditions on the geometry of a relativistic spacetime, this admits a global decomposition as a warped product space or, in particular, as a GRW spacetime.
Theorem 13. A Galilean spacetimeM,Ω,g,∇, whose 1-form Ω is exact, admits a global decomposition as a GGRW spacetime if and only if it is an ICL spacetime with a time-like irrotational conformally vector field K such that the flow of the associated field of observers,Z≔1Ω(K)K, is well defined and onto in a domainI×Ffor some intervalI⊆Rand some leaf of the foliationFinduced by Ω.
Proof. Since Ω is exact, Ω = dT for some absolute time function T ∈ C^{∞}(M). Hence, the leaves of the foliation are exactly the level sets of T, F_{t}={q∈M:T(q)=t}. We fix a leaf F_{0} of the foliation induced by Ω. Denoting by Φ_{s} the global flow of Z, we can build the same map of Theorem 12,
that is onto by hypothesis. In order to prove the injectivity, we only need to check that each integral curve of Z intersects to each leaf of F only once.We proceed reasoning by contradiction and we suppose that an integral curve of Z, γ, cuts twice the same leaf F_{b}, b∈R. In that case, there are two values s_{1}, s_{2} ∈ I, s_{1} < s_{2} such that (T ○ γ)(s_{1}) = (T ○ γ)(s_{2}). Because of the real function T◦γ:I→R is smooth, the Rolle theorem applies, and there exists s* ∈ (s_{1}, s_{2}) such that
But this is a contradiction because Z is a field of observers.Making use of the bijectivity of Ψ, together with the local result shown in Theorem 12, we conclude the proof.
Remark 14. (i) Note that the hypothesis on the absolute clock Ω automatically holds when the spacetime is simply connected. (ii) Observe that the assumption on the flow of Z trivially holds when Z is complete.Taking into account the previous remark, we can assert
Corollary 15. LetM,Ω,g,∇be an ICL spacetime with time-like irrotational conformally Leibnizian vector field K. If the absolute clock Ω is exact and1Ω(K)Kis complete, then M globally splits as a GGRW spacetime.To end this work, we present a global splitting result when the spacetime is spatially compact, that is, when the leaves of the space-like foliation are compact.
Theorem 16. LetM,Ω,g,∇be an ICL spacetime with Ω exact. If the leaves of the foliation induced by Ω are compact, then M is a GGRW spacetime.
Proof. Let Φ:D→M be the maximal local flow of the associated field of observers Z and p ∈ M be a point located in a leaf F_{p} of the induced foliation. For each q∈F_{p}, there exist a neighbourhood U_{q} on F_{p} and an interval I_{q} such that Φ is defined in I_{q} × U_{q}. Since F_{p} is compact, it can be written as F_{p}=∪_{q∈A}U_{q}, with A being a finite set. Taking I = ∩_{q∈A}I_{q}, we conclude that the flow Φ is well defined in a domain I×F_{p}, being I an interval.Assume that Ī = (a, b) is the maximal interval where Φ:Ī×F_{p}→M is defined. We are going to see that Ī is also the maximal definition interval of each integral curve with initial value in F_{p}. Suppose that there exists p_{0}∈F such that Φ(·, p_{0}) is defined in (a, b + ϵ). Since all leaves of the foliation are compact, we can take δ > 0 such that (−δ,δ)×F_{Φ(b,p0)}⊂D. Thus, it is possible to define the extension flow,
This is a contradiction.Finally, we have to prove that Φ:Ī×F_{p}→M is onto. Reasoning by contradiction, consider a point q in the complementary of Φ(Ī×F_{p}) and take the maximal interval J where Φ:J×F_{q}→M is defined. The set Φ(Ī×F_{p})∩Φ(J×F_{q}) must be empty; if a point q_{0} was in the intersection, then the integral curve of Z passing through q_{0} could be defined on an interval bigger than Ī. But this contradicts the maximality of Ī. Hence, taking into account that Φ(Ī×F_{p}) and its complementary are open in M and M is connected, we conclude that Φ(Ī×F_{p})=M. The same arguments of Theorem 5 serve to end the proof.
