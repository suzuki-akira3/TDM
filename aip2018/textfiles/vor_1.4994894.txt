Effect of intrinsic electronic defect states on the morphology and optoelectronic properties of Sn-rich SnS particles
A small variation in the elemental composition of a chemical compound can cause the formation of additional electronic defect states in the material, thereby altering the overall microstructure and thus induced properties. In this work, we observed chemical constitution-induced modification in the morphology and optoelectronic properties of SnS. To this end, SnS particles were prepared using the solution chemical route and were characterized using a wide range of experimental techniques, such as x-ray diffractometry, field emission scanning electron microscopy, high resolution transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV-Vis spectrophotometry, and scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS). All these SnS particles are found to be Sn-rich and p-type. However, distinctly different morphologies (i.e., flower-like and aggregated ones) are observed. These are then correlated with the electronic defect states, which are induced because of the presence of Sn vacancies, Sn antisites, and/or Sn interstitials. A combination of EDS, XPS, and STS data confirmed the presence of a higher concentration of Sn vacancies along with lower quantities of Sn interstitials and/or antisites in the SnS particles with flower-like morphologies giving rise to higher hole concentration, which subsequently leads to reduced transport, optical band gaps, and barrier heights.
I. INTRODUCTION
Variation in the concentration of the chemical element in a chemical compound can cause creation of electronic defect states within its band gap. This variation shifts the conduction and valence band edge positions, which then alter the transport gap in these materials [1–3]. Based on the location of these electronic defect states, the carrier concentration and carrier type of the material also get affected, as a result affecting the overall electrical properties of the material. Intrinsic defects resulting from varied synthesis conditions may guide morphologies, which in turn affect the optical properties of these materials. Hence, a slight alteration in the chemical and/or (intrinsic) defect constituents may give rise to a tunable microstructure and optoelectronic properties. Moreover, the underneath mechanism could be completely different for different materials and may not be very accurate to extrapolate to other systems.
In this work, a microstructural and optoelectronic investigation of SnS particles synthesized by varying only the tin precursor concentration in the wet chemical route was carried out. A wide range of experimental techniques, such as x-ray diffractometry (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV-Vis spectrophotometry, Hall effect measurement system (HEMS), and scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS), were used to access the chemical constituents, and optical and electrical properties of these particles. Though understanding the microstructure influenced optoelectronic properties of these SnS particles is crucial, there have been limited experimental investigations on them until the present day. Only theoretical studies based on the intrinsic defect states of SnS could be found in the literature [4,5]. The work of SnS is particularly important, as SnS is a low-cost, non-toxic, earth abundant semiconductor material for photovoltaic applications because of its appropriate direct band gap of 1.3–1.5 eV and high absorption coefficient (>10^{4} cm^{−1}) [6]. Intrinsically, it is a p-type semiconductor with theoretical efficiency of the SnS single-junction cell being 32%. Yet its device performance is still very low, with the highest reported efficiency being 4.63% [7]. The lower performance of these SnS-based solar cells is mainly attributed to the uncertainty in the conduction and valence band edge positions, which causes band misalignment with the common window-layers, like CdS, ZnO, and ZnOS [8,9]. This necessitates fundamental understanding of these band edge positions and factors responsible for this in a standalone manner along with their effect on the overall microstructure and optoelectronic properties.
II. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE
Distinctly different morphologies of SnS particles were synthesized at room temperature by varying the concentration of the Sn precursor [i.e., Tin (II) chloride dihydrate (SnCl_{2}·2H_{2}O)] from 0.5 to 1.0 M (in steps of 0.1 M), while keeping the concentration of all other chemicals {i.e., S precursor [i.e., thioacetamide (CH_{3}CSNH_{2})] and triethanolamine [TEA, (HOCH_{2}CH_{2})_{3}N]} fixed.
In a typical experimental procedure, a beaker containing 10 ml of the respective concentration of SnCl_{2}·2H_{2}O was placed on a magnetic stirrer. Then few drops of HCl (of 35.4% concentration) were added to avoid the formation of Sn(OH)_{2}. Next, 3.32 ml of triethanolamine was added dropwise to the solution to form a Sn-TEA complex. pH of the solution was adjusted to 9.0 by adding aqueous ammonia (of 30% concentration). Finally, 10 ml of 1 M thioacetamide was added dropwise to this solution and aged for 24 h. The solution gradually turned dark brown indicating the formation of SnS particles. These particles were then collected and repeatedly washed with ethanol (of 50% concentration) and ultra-high purity water (18.2 MΩ cm, obtained from a Millipore Direct-Q water purification system). Finally, these washed particles were dried in air for 24 h and then in an oven at 90 °C for 15–20 min before grinding in a mortar to get the dried SnS particles. All these chemicals used in this study were of 99.99% purity and of ACS grade.
After the SnS particles were synthesized, their overall microstructure was analyzed using XRD (Model: D8 Discover, Supplier: Bruker Corporation) and FESEM (Model: JSM 7600F, Supplier: JEOL Ltd.). The XRD measurements were carried out in the 2θ range of 10°–90° (step size of 0.02°) using Cu K_{α} (λ = 0.15418 nm) radiation. For FESEM analysis, first particles were coated with Pt before introducing them into the FESEM chamber. Accelerating voltage ranging from 3 to 8 kV was used to capture these images. Elemental compositions of these particles were obtained using EDS (Model: Aztec, Supplier: Oxford Instrument) at an acceleration voltage of 7 kV and a working distance of 15 mm with an acquisition time of 60 s. For accurate measurement, a Pt-coating was employed on all these particles before carrying out the EDS measurement. HRTEM was performed on the SnS particles using an acceleration voltage of 300 kV (Model: Tecnai G2, Supplier: FEI). XPS (Model: PHI 5000 Versa Prob II, Supplier: ULVAC-PHI, Inc.) with a spot size of 10 μm was employed to investigate the surface chemical states of these particles.
Optical properties (i.e., absorbance and optical band gap) of these SnS particles were then investigated by a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Model: UV-1700, Supplier: Shimadzu) in the wavelength range of 200–1000 nm. To this end, the SnS particles were dispersed in ultra-high purity water by ultrasonication for 20 min, and then the final solution was transferred to the cuvette to measure the absorption spectra. The optical band gap of these particles was determined using the Tauc equation [10]. Additionally, electrical resistivity, carrier concentration, and the carrier mobility were measured using the AC HEMS (Model: 8404 AC/DC HMS, Lakeshore) through the following steps: first pellets of 1 cm diameter and 3 mm thickness were prepared by using the dried SnS particles in a pelletizer, and then, indium metal was then used to contact the four corners of these pellets in the Van Der Pauw configuration before applying the electric and magnetic fields. To measure the transport gap of SnS particles, surface electronic characterization was carried out using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)/scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) analysis. To this end, the particles were deposited on freshly cleaved highly oriented pyrolytic graphite by the drop cast method. STM images were taken using the Pt/Ir tip (PT-10; Supplier: Bruker corporation) of 0.25 mm diameter and 8 mm length under ambient conditions using the STM attachment of the scanning probe microscope. Further local current-voltage (I-V) characteristics from these SnS particles were recorded in the STS mode. Current-Voltage (I-V) patterns pertaining to each of these STM images were then acquired from many different locations of these captured 1 μm × 1 μm STM images, while keeping the set current value of 1.5 nA fixed and varying the applied sample bias between −1.0 V and +1.0 V.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Irrespective of the initial precursor concentration, all these particles were found to consist of only SnS in XRD with dominant (111) orientation [see Fig. 1(a)] and are in good agreement with the standard profile of orthorhombic SnS (JCPDS 39-0354) with lattice parameters of a = 4.3291 Å, b = 11.1923 Å, and c = 3.9838 Å [11]. Figures 1(b)–1(g) show the FESEM images of these SnS particles synthesized by varying the Sn precursor concentration. Whereas the SnS particles synthesized at 0.5, 0.9, and 1.0 M concentration of Sn precursor were found to consist of irregular aggregates (with no signs of flower type hierarchical structure), the particles synthesized from 0.6 to 0.8 M concentration of Sn precursor were found to form flower-like morphologies with a hierarchical structure consisting of nanosheets typically ranging from 9 to 15 nm thickness. Moreover, particles of SnS were found to be deposited over the nanosheets resulting in a dense sphere [see Figs. 2(a) and 2(b)]. Furthermore, these nanosheets showed well resolved lattice fringes with 0.285 nm interplanar spacing, which correspond to the (111) crystallographic plane, hence in agreement with the XRD data [see Figs. 2(c) and 2(d) of the HRTEM micrograph] [12].
From the observed morphologies at different Sn^{+2} to TEA molar ratio (by varying only the Sn precursor concentration), it was noted that SnS particles with flower-like morphologies were obtained for the Sn precursor concentrations varying from 0.6 to 0.8. This is due to the chelate formation ([Sn(TEA)_{n}]^{+2}) followed by aggregation of these chelates into an oriented cluster ({[Sn(TEA)_{n}]^{+2.}2Cl^{−}} _{k}) which controlled the SnS particle growth in (111) in 3-d space, thereby resulting in flower-like morphologies [13]. At higher Sn precursor concentration, the excess Sn^{+2} ions could not be chelated to [Sn(TEA)_{n}]^{+2}, thereby making the process uncontrollable, which led to the rapid reaction between the freely available Sn^{+2} and S^{−2} ions, hence forming large agglomerated SnS particles. On the other hand, at lower Sn precursor concentration, due to the complete capping of the SnS particles, further growth after nucleation became restricted, resulting in the formation of a smaller particle size [e.g., approximately 50–100 nm; see Fig. 1(b)].
To summarize, the formation of the chelated complex (before addition of sulphur source) and varying Sn concentration (and thus, Sn^{2+}/TEA ratio) are crucial factors which govern the overall morphology of the particles. Moreover, the average crystallite sizes of the SnS particles with the flower-like morphologies as calculated using the Scherrer equation were found to be larger (i.e., in the range of 15.3–16.4 nm) than those with the aggregated morphologies (i.e., in the range of 12.2–13.1 nm; see Fig. 3 and the supplementary material for the details) [14]. Thus, the observed larger crystallite sizes and higher (111) intensities in the XRD pattern for the SnS particles with flower-like morphologies strongly suggest the presence of the higher amount of lattice defects in the other lattice planes [i.e., (120), (101), (131), (141), (211), (151), (061), and (212) orientations as shown in the XRD pattern]. It might be speculated that the presence of the higher amount of lattice defects in these planes may have hindered the crystal growth in these orientations because of the increase in lattice energies for these planes, which eventually subside the driving force for the crystal growth in these orientations, thereby promoting the crystal growth in (111).
The local surface electrical properties (i.e., I-V) as measured using STS from 26 different points of the SnS particles are shown in Figs. 4(a)–4(f) with their corresponding tunneling conductance (dI/dV), which represent the local density of states of the sample (ρ_{sample}) being presented in Figs. 4(a′)–4(f′). dI/dV and ρ_{sample} are related as per the following equation:
where e is the electronic charge, ρ_{tip} is the local density of states of the tip, at an electron energy E from the Fermi energy of the sample E_{F}, V is the bias voltage, and T(E,eV,d) is the tunneling transmission probability for electrons with energy E and applied voltage V over the distance from the sample to the tip d. Assuming the effects of ρ_{tip} and T(E,eV,d) to be minimal and often neglected in the literature, dI/dV can be directly proportional to only ρ_{sample} [15–17].
Both these curves display local conductance (and their heterogeneity) over the surfaces of these particles. Overall, the local electrical properties from a particular sample surface were found to be almost identical, indicating an electrically homogeneous sample surface, although electrical heterogeneity could be seen among particles with varied morphology. In particular, the local I-V curves from the SnS particles having the aggregated morphologies (i.e., particles synthesized using 0.5, 0.9, and 1.0 M Sn source concentration) were found to be largely symmetric (i.e., poor Schottky or Ohmic-like behavior) between the positive and negative bias regions, whereas those consisting of the flower-like ones (i.e., particles synthesized at 0.6, 0.7 and 0.8 M Sn source concentration) were found to be asymmetric and exhibited Schottky behavior [see Figs. 4(a)–4(f)]. The band gap (i.e., zero conductance around the Fermi energy) could be seen in all these SnS particles, further confirming their semiconductor characteristics [10]. Note that, under the condition of biasing the sample (as a case here), the first inception in the positive voltage side of the dI/dV curve represents the conduction band edge, whereas the first inception in the negative voltage side is the valence band edge. The gap between these two band edges is the transport band gap [see Figs. 4(a′)–4(f′)] [18]. Whereas the conduction band edges for the flower-like SnS particles were found to vary a little, their corresponding valence band edge positions were found to shift distinctly to lower values [implying otherwise in the shift of the Fermi level to the valence band side; see Fig. 5(a) and also Table I] as compared to the aggregated ones (i.e., from around 0.71–0.72 eV for the aggregated particles to 0.45–0.54 eV for the flower-like ones). Consequently, the transport band gap for the flower-like morphologies was found to be less as compared to the aggregated ones [varying between 1.29 and 1.37 eV for the former to 1.45 and 1.49 eV for the latter; see Fig. 5(b)]. Moreover, the increased transport band gap of these aggregated SnS particles can be attributed to the quantum size effect caused by an overall decrease in the crystallite size (see Fig. 3) [14,19,20]. These data are found to be in agreement with the trend followed by the optical band gap for these particles [see Fig. 5(b) and Fig. S1 in the supplementary material].
Additionally, the incidence of the Fermi level was found to be in general closure to the valence band edge rather than the conduction band edge for all these SnS particles synthesized by varying the precursor concentration (see Table I), confirming presence of the electronic defect states at the acceptor level, and thereby indicating p-type characteristics of these particles. Moreover, the presence of the Fermi level near the center of the bandgap for the aggregated SnS particles may indicate very weak p-type conduction (or nearly intrinsic conduction) in these particles. This is in agreement with the data obtained using the HEMS, where all these SnS particles demonstrated p-type conductivity. Besides, further shift in the Fermi level to the valence band edge for the SnS particles with flower-like morphologies, indicated presence of increased quantities of (p-type) defect states at the acceptor level. This is also concurrent with the hole (or carrier) concentration (p_{h}) data obtained using the HEMS system, where higher p_{h} varying in the range of (8.51–9.03)× 10^{12} cm^{−3} was obtained for the SnS particles with flower-like morphologies than those of the aggregated ones [varying in the range of (8.05–8.12) × 10^{12} cm^{−3}; see Fig. 5(b)]. The hole mobility in all these SnS particles irrespective of the tin precursor concentration was found to remain the same in the range of 0.32–0.34 cm^{2} V^{−1} s^{−1}, suggesting little influence of particle morphology on the hole mobility. Subsequently, electrical resistivity was found to be lower for the SnS particles with flower-like morphologies than those of the aggregated ones (see Table I).
To further understand the type of defect responsible for producing the p-type characteristic in SnS particles and also their increased quantities in the flower-like morphologies, the chemical constitution data obtained by SEM-EDS [i.e., the average Sn-S-ratio as calculated from 10 different points; see Fig. 5(c)] for all these samples were compared and further assessed using XPS. Overall, all these SnS particles irrespective of Sn precursor concentration were found to be Sn-rich [see Table II, Figs. 6(a)–6(f) and 6(a′)–6(f′)]. Yet, a trend in the relative concentration of the individual Sn and S atoms linked with the morphology of these SnS particles (i.e., relatively lower concentration of Sn and higher concentration of S in the flower-like morphologies) could be seen. This led to the lowering of the average Sn-to-S-ratio for the flower-like morphologies as compared to those of the aggregated ones [compare between 1.08 and 1.21 of the SEM-EDS (with the average Sn and S concentrations varying between 52.0 and 54.9 and 45.1 and 48.0 at. % respectively) for the former with 1.31 and 1.38 (with the Sn and S concentrations varying between 56.7 and 58.1 and 41.9 and 43.3 at. % respectively) for the latter]. This observation was also found to be in agreement with the XPS data for the Sn-to-S atomic ratios [see Table II, Fig. 5(c) and the supplementary material for details], clearly indicating the chemical similarity between the bulk and surfaces of all these SnS particles [14]. To understand the valence states of these elements, these data were further compared with the data obtained by XPS [see Figs. 6(a)–6(f) and 6(a′)–6(f′)]. The binding energy positions of Sn 3d_{5/2} and Sn 3d_{3/2} were found to be at 485.81 ± 0.02 eV and 494.23 ± 0.01 eV, respectively, with a doublet separation of 8.4 ± 0.01 eV suggesting Sn in +2 states [7,21]. In addition, the peaks at 161.33 ± 0.02 and 162.43 ± 0.02 eV are due to the S 2p_{3/2} and 2p_{1/2} with the doublet separation of 1.09 ± 0.01 eV, which confirmed the S valence state to be −2 (see Table II) [22]. Additionally, XPS wide scan measurements ranging from 0 to 900 eV were carried out for all these synthesized SnS particles, which ensured almost clean surfaces (i.e., the presence of very little surface contaminants of C1s at 283 ± 1 eV and O1s at 530 ± 1 eV apart from Sn and S peaks; see Fig. 7).
Hence, the observed decrease in the Sn-to-S-ratio for the SnS particles with flower-like morphologies close to a stoichiometric value both in SEM-EDS and XPS (i.e., Sn-to-S ratio closer to 1.0) suggested the presence of a higher concentration of Sn^{+2} vacancies than those of the aggregated SnS particles. This observation is in agreement with the data reported by Malone et_al, who performed first principles calculations on point defects in SnS particles and predicted easy formation of Sn^{+2} vacancies in Sn-rich SnS particles due to their lower formation energies, though no Sn-to-S-ratio-dependent theoretical calculations for Sn-rich SnS were conducted in their study [4]. In their calculation, Sn^{+2} vacancies were formed at shallow acceptor levels and were found to be mainly responsible in the p-type conductivity in SnS by increasing p_{h}. The observed higher concentration of p_{h} in the flower-like morphologies in this work also supported the inferred higher concentration of Sn^{+2} vacancies in these samples. Subsequently, the Fermi energy was found to shift towards the valence band position, thereby lowering the transport as well as the optical gap.
It should be further noted here that all these synthesized SnS particles irrespective of the Sn precursor concentration was found to be Sn-rich (in +2 state only) and were also found to contain Sn vacancies. This led to the possibility of the existence of the extra Sn atoms (apart from those in Sn lattice positions of the SnS crystal structure) as either Sn interstitial (Sn_{i}) and/or Sn antisites (Sn_{S}). Presence of Sn_{i} would lead to the development of tensile strain, whereas Sn_{S} would generate compressive strain within these particles because of the smaller ionic radius of Sn^{+2} (i.e., 0.93 Å) as compared to S^{−2} (i.e., 1.70 Å), leading to the development of non-uniform local strain fields in the elementary cell of SnS, thereby making the corresponding interplanar spacings non-uniform (i.e., either larger or smaller) [23,24]. Moreover, both Sn_{S} and Sn_{i} have lower formation energies in Sn-rich SnS and would therefore be energetically preferred [4]. Note that the formation energy of Sn_{S} is even lower than that of Sn_{i}, thereby making it preferable over Sn_{i} [4]. Depending on the magnitude of these local strains, the local structure could be very complex, resulting in bending [25]. The observed HR-TEM image of the bent SnS nanosheet, synthesized at 0.7 M Sn precursor concentration, strongly suggests the presence of this type of complex (strained) structure in the SnS particles with the flower-like morphologies [see Fig. 2(c)]. Note that whereas compressive strain widens the optical band gap because of the increased repulsion between the outer orbitals in a compressed lattice (in this case between the Sn 3d and S 2p bands), tensile strain leads to narrow down this band gap because of increased spacing between these orbitals [25,26]. Thus, the higher optical band gap observed in general in the aggregated SnS particles than those with the flower-like morphologies might be due to the presence of a relatively higher amount of compressive strain for the former, which could not be ascertained in the present work. Additionally, a Sn-rich condition may also arise from the deficient S atoms, leading to the formation of S vacancies (V_{S}) [4].
The formation of donor-like defects (i.e., Sn_{S}, Sn_{i}, and/or V_{S}) increases the Fermi energy positions to higher values, thereby reducing the hole concentration in the material, as hole (carrier) concentration is denoted as the difference between the acceptor and donor concentrations [4,5]. In this study, the aggregated SnS particles were higher with Sn-rich as well as have lower acceptor-like defects (i.e., Sn^{+2} vacancies) as compared to the flower-like morphologies. The lower hole concentration observed in general for these aggregated SnS particles as compared to those of the flower-like morphologies might indicate the existence of the increased concentration of donor-like defects. Subsequently, the average barrier height (Φ) for the SnS particles with flower-like morphologies was found to be considerably reduced (i.e., 0.45–0.47 eV) compared to those of the aggregated ones (i.e., 0.52 to 0.58 eV; see Table III and Fig. 8), indicating lower turn on field values for the former [10]. Thus, the observed superior values of flower-like SnS might be attributed to the synergic effect of the petals-like morphology, enhanced p-type character, and narrower band gap.
IV. CONCLUSION
In summary, in this work, a relation between the electronic defect states and morphology for the SnS particles was established. To this end, the SnS particles were synthesized by varying only the tin precursor concentration from 0.5 to 1.0 M in a solution chemical route. Two different kinds of morphologies (i.e., flower-like and aggregated ones) were observed here, the growth mechanisms of which were discussed. Overall, all these particles were found to be Sn-rich and demonstrated p-type conductivity. STS data showed the presence of Sn vacancies, whereas XPS confirmed the presence of Sn and S in +2 and −2 states, respectively. A combination of SEM-EDS, XPS, and STS data confirmed the presence of a higher concentration of Sn vacancies as well as lower quantities of Sn interstitials and/or Sn antisites in SnS particles with flower-like morphologies, which resulted in higher hole concentration as well as reduced transport and optical band gap in these particles. Subsequently, these particles displayed a lower barrier height. The understanding developed during this study might help in designing multifunctional materials by tuning their morphology.
