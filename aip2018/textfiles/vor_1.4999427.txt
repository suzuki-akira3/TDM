Pulse measurement of the hot spot current in a NbTiN superconducting filament
We have studied the voltage response of superconducting NbTiN filaments to a step-pulse of over-critical current I > I_{c}. The current induces the destruction of the Cooper pairs and initiates different mechanisms of dissipation depending on the bath temperature T. For the sample investigated, and for T above a certain T*, not far from T_{c}, the resistance manifests itself in the form of a phase-slip center, which turns into a normal hot spot (HS) as the step-pulse is given larger amplitudes. However, at all temperatures below T^{*}, the destruction of superconductivity still occurs at I_{c}(T), but leads directly to an ever-growing HS. By lowering the current amplitude during the pulse, one can produce a steady HS and thus define a threshold HS current I_{h}(T). That is achieved by combining two levels of current, the first and larger one to initiate an HS, the second one to search for constant voltage response. The double diagram of the functions I_{c}(T) and I_{h}(T) was plotted in the T-range T_{c}/2 < T < T_{c}, and their crossing found at T^{*} = (8.07 ± 0.07) K.
I. INTRODUCTION
The destruction of superconductivity by a pair-breaking critical current leads to very specific resistive states in filaments of reduced transverse dimensions, in the form of localized phase-slip centers (PSCs) or of normal-state hot spots (HSs) [1]. Manifestations of such structures appeared as reproducible steps in the ascent of the resistance versus temperature R(T) of tiny tin whiskers [2] of cross section 10^{−2} to 1 μm^{2}, steps that did not fit with the model of thermally activated fluctuations. These stair-steps in the R(T) curve have their correspondent in the current-voltage I vs V curve, not only for whiskers but also for thin films [3]. The standard model of a PSC, with its extension over twice the inelastic quasi-particle diffusion length, was subsequently worked out in Ref [4]. The PSCs were thereafter generalized to phase-slip lines (PSL) in films much wider than the coherence length [5,6]. In addition, Ref [4] also describes quantitatively the possibility of localized HSs, kept normal above T_{c} by the Joule effect. All these structures can also be created by step-pulses of current, instead of dc currents. This offers the possibility to modulate the current during the very pulse of creation and obtain expanding or shrinking HSs. The intensity that keeps the voltage constant is designated as the hot spot current I_{h}(T). Any lower current leads the voltage to zero. It is reminiscent (although different) of the hysteresis current I_{H}(T) that is defined on the dc current-voltage characteristics of thin films [7].
With the progress of deposition and lithographic techniques, it has become possible to fabricate nanostrips sensitive to the energy of a single optical or near-infrared photon (∼1 eV) which triggered the development of efficient SNSPDs, or superconducting nanowire single photon detectors [8,9]. Upon the absorption of the photon, only a part of the detecting strip goes to the normal state, but that forces the current to pass around the resistive region and the current density J to exceed the critical J_{c} in those contiguous regions. Then a normal zone is created across the full width of the strip and a voltage spike is recorded. The processes by which the impact of a photon leads to a hot spot have been reviewed by Semenov et_al [10] The case of vortex motion as the initiator of a hot spot has been analyzed in detail by Bulaevskii et_al [11] More recently, it was shown theoretically [12] that, in proper conditions of current bias, a single photon is efficient enough to generate a hot spot even in a film several microns wide film.
The present work is devoted to the study of the resistive singularities attainable with an electrical current only: PSCs at temperatures close to T_{c}, and localized HS at lower temperatures, that are usually the domain in which the SNSPDs are operated. These two types of dissipation centers are discriminated from other forms of dissipation (i.e., vortex flow) by their delay time [1] and distinguished between themselves from their specific voltage versus time signal shapes. The measurements aim at locating these resistive states in a current versus temperature diagram I_{c}(T), I_{h}(T).
II. SAMPLE PREPARATION AND EXPERIMENTAL SET UP
The NbTiN strip, of thickness b = 150 nm and width w = 10 μm, used in this experiment was deposited on sapphire in an argon-nitrogen plasma environment by employing DC magnetron sputtering (STAR-Cryoelectronics, NM, USA). Standard photo-lithographic and ion milling processes were used to pattern four gold contact pads, two in series with the filament, and two lateral probes 1 mm apart. The experiment was performed under vacuum in a 4 K closed-cycle cryostat with a temperature controller. The substrate temperatures T_{b} were varied from 3.6 K to the critical temperature, T_{c} ≃ 9.5 K. The electrical residual resistivity at 15 K was found to be ρ = 147 μΩ cm.
We investigated the voltage response of that NbTiN filament to rectangular current pulses at different temperatures. In order to obtain the critical current, we used a single pulse-generator to send variable voltage pulse amplitudes of 450 ns duration through low-loss delay line. However, two electrical current pulses from two different pulse generators were superposed to determine the hot spot current I_{h}. In order to approach the condition of constant current through the sample, once the resistive state is created, we inserted a divider made of two resistors. A 467 Ω resistor was mounted in series with the sample and a 57 Ω in parallel to ground (Fig. 1). With this configuration, in the superconducting state, the circuit is terminated by an equivalent 50 Ω impedance and the reflected pulse is minimized.
III. RESISTIVE MODES IN A SUPERCONDUCTING FILAMENT
The existence of the superconducting state is determined by three main parameters: the critical temperature T_{c}, the critical magnetic field H_{c}, and the critical current I_{c}. Exceeding one of those parameters results in the suppression of superconductivity. The breakdown of superconductivity by an overcritical current involves specific features such as phase-slip centers or vortices. Slightly above the critical current, and for a transient period, the state of the material generally does not represent fully the normal conducting state, although it exhibits a finite resistance. We specialize ourselves to the case where the vortex flow is not concerned. Figure 2 illustrates the different types of resistive behavior of a NbTiN filament submitted to rectangular (step-like) pulses of overcritical current. Each block, 2a or 2b, is a record of oscilloscope traces of the voltages V(t) at two close values of the bath temperature [8.25 K for the upper case Fig. 2(a); 8.00 K for the lower case Fig. 2(b)]. Finite delay times of several tens of nanoseconds are features common to all these traces. We will not develop that subject in the present Communication.
According to a detailed study of the resistive states in metallic superconductors [13] and in high-T_{c} materials [14], exceeding the critical current results in the nucleation of a phase-slip center of definite extension (twice the inelastic diffusion length) that can be maintained as a stable structure near T_{c}, and that gives rise to a saturating voltage signal as it is obvious in Fig. 2(a). However, at lower temperatures, the critical current value exceeds the minimum value I_{h} that can maintain an isolated hot spot. Therefore, the PSC soon transforms into an HS, which grows without limit if the current is maintained. That process explains the non-saturating voltage signals displayed for the temperature 8.00 K in Fig. 2(b). The boundary temperature T^{*} between these two regimes must satisfy 8.00 K < T^{*} < 8.25 K. Let us recall that a hot spot is a truly normal zone maintained above T_{c} by the Joule effect, while a PSC belongs to the superconducting state, in which the dissipation comes from the succession of quantum (2π) phase-slips between the two extremities of the filament.
IV. MEASUREMENT OF THE HOT SPOT CURRENT I_{h}(T)
The occurrence of each type of resistive structure, whether PSC or HS, is better understood on an I vs T diagram, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4, already investigated in Nb [13] and YBaCuO filaments [14]. Going up from intensity zero, the first current that gives birth to a voltage signal is the pair-breaking critical value I_{c}(T) (blue line and crosses in Fig. 4). The “hot spot” current I_{h} (red line and circles) is defined as the intensity just able to maintain by Joule heating a finite steady normal zone at a temperature T > T_{c}. Unlike the more familiar dc hysteresis current I_{H}(T) [15], our HS characteristic current I_{h}(T) applies to a limited length of material, non-uniform in temperature.
Due to the (1 - T/T_{c})^{3∕2} dependence of I_{c}(T), and the parabola-like shape of I_{h}(T), the representative curves have to coincide, besides T_{c}, at another temperature we call T^{*}, usually not far from T_{c}. The crossing value T^{*} depends upon the material parameters, but generally tends to lower values as the thickness of the material is reduced [14]) If one proceeds by simple step-pulses, the first resistive singularity occurs at I_{c} (T), with different consequences. In the high-T region T^{*} < T < T_{c}, a current of amplitude reaching the critical Ic first produces one or several PSCs, then possibly an HS by two cooperating ways (i) current increase up to I_{h}(T), and (ii) increase of the PSC internal temperature at constant amplitude [16]. That ambiguity makes it difficult to capture the real value of I_{h}(T). In the low-T region 0 < T < T^{*} however, one crosses the I_{h}(T) curve without visible consequence, until the current amplitude reaches I_{c}(T), in which case the resistive singularity quickly transforms into an expanding normal zone, resulting in a monotonous increase of the voltage. The critical current I_{c}(T) was measured (Fig. 3) in that manner by using a current step-pulse, I_{c} being defined as the minimum current giving rise to a voltage at t_{d} = 450 ns, the longest pulse duration we used. The determination of the curve I_{h}(T) below T^{*} is performed by observing the collapse of a hot spot created “from above,” by using the superposition of two rectangular pulses. The main pulse, 450 ns long, is chosen with an amplitude I < I_{c}(T) such that it does not generate a voltage response by itself. The upper limit I_{c} (T) is shown in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b). A secondary shorter pulse (about 20 ns in Fig. 3) is added by means of a matched coaxial T so as to exceed the critical I_{c}(T) and induce the creation of an HS. At the termination of that secondary pulse, beyond an immediate drop of the voltage, the filament is left with the subcritical current I, and the response can adopt one of the three behaviours: (i) an increase of the voltage, proving the inequality I > I_{h}(T); (ii) a more or less rapid collapse of the voltage, proving the inequality I < I_{h}(T); (iii) a voltage stabilized at a steady level (not shown) which defines the current denoted I_{h} in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) until the end of the main pulse. In these figures, the incident current pulses I_{c}(t) and I_{h}(t) are taken at the input of the delay line; the voltage pulses collected at the voltage probe of the filament appear shifted in time by 250 ns corresponding to the length of the delay line and in both cases correspond to a choice I > I_{h}(T). One notes that the difference between I_{h}(T) and I_{c}(T) diminishes as T gets closer to T^{*}. The data concerning our measurements of I_{c} and I_{h}(T) are collected in Fig. 4. The crossing temperature is found to be T^{*} = (8.07 ± 0.07) K.
It has been noted generally that the Nanowire Superconducting Single Photon Detectors (NSSPD) photon-efficiency increases as the bias current is increased, up to I_{c}(T). However, a too large bias (typically above about 80% I_{c}) favors the rise of dark counts, or false detection events. I_{h}(T) being the cut-off amplitude which separates the decaying normal HSs from the expanding ones, it is likely to be related to that threshold for the advent of dark counts.
I_{h}(T) is the current that maintains steadily by Joule effect a normal HS localized anywhere along the strip. Due to that condition, it is entirely determined for each bath temperature T by (i) the electron and phonon specific heats in the N and S states, (ii) the electron heat conductivities in the N and S states, and finally (iii) the heat transfer-law at the substrate-film interface that can be cast into a characteristic phonon escape time τ_{esc}. Therefrom, it results a one-to-one correspondence between τ_{esc} and I_{h}(T). The problem was solved in the case of niobium-on-sapphire [17] for which all the relevant parameters are either known or accessible by measurement. With τ_{esc} determined from the PSC nucleation time, one obtains by computation a I_{h}(T) function in quantitative agreement with the I_{h}(T) measured by the double-pulse method. Unfortunately, for NbTiN filaments, one lacks sufficient knowledge of the parameters to apply a similar analysis.
V. CONCLUSION
When driven by step pulses of critical current, a narrow superconducting NbTiN filament responds by two types of localized resistive structures, PSCs near T_{c} and normal hot spots (HS) well below T_{c}. Even though both types show different voltage waveshapes, they are characterized on the nanosecond scale by nucleation delay times. This allows ruling out vortex flow as a significant source of dissipation.
By using an excitation made of two successive values, the first one to create an HS, a second smaller one to probe it, we measure the border I_{h}(T) between the currents that maintain the HS, and the current leading to the its extinction. A current-temperature diagram of states was drawn with the plots of I_{c}(T) and I_{h}(T) from T_{c} down to ∼T_{c}/2, separating the permanent HS from the transient ones below I_{h}(T). This could apply to a detector filament if the device is fed with controlled current.
