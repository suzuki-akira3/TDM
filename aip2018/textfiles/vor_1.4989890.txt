Reduction by invariants and projection of linear representations of Lie algebras applied to the construction of nonlinear realizations
A procedure for the construction of nonlinear realizations of Lie algebras in the context of Vessiot–Guldberg–Lie algebras of first-order systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is proposed. The method is based on the reduction of invariants and projection of lowest-dimensional (irreducible) representations of Lie algebras. Applications to the description of parameterized first-order systems of ODEs related by contraction of Lie algebras are given. In particular, the kinematical Lie algebras in (2 + 1)- and (3 + 1)-dimensions are realized simultaneously as Vessiot–Guldberg–Lie algebras of parameterized nonlinear systems in R^{3} and R^{4}, respectively.
I. INTRODUCTION
Superposition rules for systems of first- and second-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) play a fundamental role in physics, not only quantitatively, as they provide a prescription to determine the general solution of the system, but also qualitatively, as they enable us to establish additional properties of conserved quantities and their relation to perturbations or extensions of a system [1,2]. Fundamental sets of solutions of systems of differential equations have been extensively studied for a long time (see Refs [3–5] and references therein), currently constituting a standard procedure in the analysis of dynamical systems [6,7]. Further, applications to Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics have stimulated alternative approaches that go beyond the classical analytical perspective, combining techniques arising in different mathematical disciplines. A central problem within this frame is the classification of equivalence classes of realizations of Lie algebras as vector fields [8–10], a question that currently has not been solved in full generality, up to special types of Lie algebras or realizations in n ≤ 3 variables [11]. An important formal step towards such a classification was obtained in Ref [12], reducing the problem to the determination of transitive primitive Lie algebras. More recently, the existing classification of realizations of Lie algebras in low dimensions has been used to classify the corresponding first-order systems of ODEs [7], and applications to the theory of integrable systems have been developed [13].
In this context, linear representations of Lie algebras provide an ample but trivial class of realizations, as they correspond to linear systems. However, it seems that the possibilities of representations have not been exhaustively exploited, as these realizations can sometimes be reduced with respect to some invariants of the realization, or either, considering suitable coordinates, projected onto subspaces that preserve the commutators of generators. A particularly important example of this situation is given by the coadjoint representation of Lie algebras and their generalized Casimir invariants, suitable to label irreducible representations. It is therefore natural to ask whether using invariant functions of realizations associated to representations other than the adjoint can be useful to construct genuinely nonlinear realizations of Lie algebras that provide in first instance a realization of a Lie algebra as a Vessiot–Guldberg–Lie algebra of a first-order system. Even if not suitable for generic types of Lie algebras where their representation theory is not completely known, as the solvable algebras, the approach at least provides an alternative approach that can be combined with invariant theory and contractions of Lie algebras.
It is the purpose of this work to illustrate how the reduction of representations of Lie algebras g with respect to certain invariants, as well as results from the embedding theory, can lead to realizations of g as a Vessiot–Guldberg–Lie algebra of genuinely first-order nonlinear systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs in short), i.e., systems that are not equivalent to linear systems. In addition, the notion of contractions of Lie algebras is used to determine realizations as vector fields that are simultaneously valid for various non-isomorphic Lie algebras, enabling us to determine nonlinear systems, the Vessiot–Guldberg–Lie algebra of which depends on the values of the parameters.
Unless otherwise stated, any Lie algebra g and any representation is considered over the field R of real numbers. The Einstein summation convention is used.
A. Vessiot–Guldberg–Lie algebras of first-order systems
Definition 1. A system of ordinary differential equations
is said to possess a fundamental system of solutions if its general solution can be expressed in terms of a finite number m of functionally independent particular solutionsy_{1},⋯,y_{m}and n significant constantsC_{1},⋯,C_{n},
wherey_{k}=yk1,⋯,ykn.As the solutions of (1) correspond to integral curves of a vector field X_{t} in R^{n}, the system can be rewritten in terms of the latter as
From this results a one-to-one correspondence between systems and vector fields of this type. Now, we say that equation (2) is a superposition rule for the system, with y_{1},⋯,y_{m} a fundamental system of solutions. A central result concerning the existence of fundamental systems of solutions is given by the so-called Lie–Scheffers theorem, the proof of which can be found in Ref [3].
Theorem. A system of first-order ODEs (1) possesses a generic fundamental system of solutions if it can be represented in the form
where the vector fields
span an r-dimensional Lie algebra L_{VG}. Moreover, the following numerical constraint holds:
Whenever this theorem applies, X_{t} can be written as a t-dependent linear combination of the vector fields X_{α},
We call L_{VG} a Vessiot–Guldberg–Lie algebra of the system (1) [33]. If such an algebra exists, then the possibility of deriving a (nonlinear) superposition principle is guaranteed [2,5,7], albeit there is no generically valid rule for an explicit construction of the latter.Whether a first-order system is linear or not depends essentially on the equivalence class of the realization of g as vector fields. It is therefore convenient to inspect some of the structural properties more closely. First of all, we convene in the following that a realization of a Lie algebra g by vector fields is an injective homomorphism Φ:g→XR^{n} so that no generator in g is realized by the zero vector field (such realizations are called faithful in Ref [11]). We further recall that two n-dimensional realizations Φ:g→XR^{n} and Φ^:g→XR^{n} with basis vector fields
are called equivalent if there exists a change of basis x^{i}=x^{i}x in R^{n} such that the identities
are satisfied. It should be taken into account that there is a weaker definition of equivalence based on automorphisms of g other than the identity (see, e.g., Refs [7] and  [11] and references therein). For our purposes, the preceding notion will be sufficient.Let X_{1},⋯,X_{r} be the generators of a Lie algebra g, and let Φ:g→XR^{n} be a realization of g,
The realization Φ can be described globally using matrices, defining
where A_{Φ}g∈M_{n×r}C^{∞}R^{n} is the functional matrix of the components of the realized vector fields in the coordinates x^{1},⋯,x^{n}. The matrix A_{Φ}g will be called the realization matrix, and its generic rank called the rank of the realization Φ, denoted by r_{Φ}g. It is obvious that r_{Φ}g≤minn,r.It is customary to write realizations of Lie algebras in standard form, i.e., in an appropriate coordinate system y^{1},⋯,y^{n}, we have X̃{1}=∂∂y^{1}, possibly after reordering the basis of g [9]. To this extent, the coordinates y^{1},⋯,y^{n} must satisfy the (affine) system
where x̃=x^{1},⋯,x^{n} and 2 ≤ k ≤ n. The second equation implies that the coordinates y^{2},⋯,y^{n} are functions of the invariants φ_{1},⋯,φ_{n−1} of the vector field X_{1}, while y^{1} is a particular solution of the affine equation (12). In this context, it is important to realize that the “standardization”
of a realization (10) can lead to various locally non-equivalent realizations of g [9–11].
B. Reducible systems and negligible coordinates
It turns out that if for some index i_{0}∈1,⋯,n the components ξαi_{0} of a system (1) vanish for 1 ≤ α ≤ r, then ẋ{i0}=0 and x^{i0}=k_{0} is a constant. We can neglect this coordinate and treat k_{0} as a parameter, which allows us to extract a system in n−1-variables
leading by (7) to a realization of g as vector fields in XR^{n−1},
where x̃=x^{1},⋯,x^{i0−1},k_{0},x^{i0+1},⋯,x_{n}. If the system (1) possesses one or more coordinates that are constant, we shall say that the system can be reduced.
Lemma 1. LetΦ:g→XR^{n}be a realization ofgof rankr_{Φ}gsuch thatΦgis a Vessiot–Guldberg–Lie algebra of a first-order system (1). Up to a suitable choice of coordinates, there exist
indicesi_{1},⋯,i_{χ0}⊆1,⋯,nand coordinatesx^{i1},⋯,x^{iχ0}such that
Moreover, the induced realizationΦ̃:g→XR^{n−χ0}satisfiesr_{Φ̃}g=n−χ_{0}.The proof is an adaptation of a well-known property of complete systems of first-order systems complete systems of first-order partial differential equations (PDEs) [14]. Let Fx∈C^{∞}R^{n} be a differentiable function. From (11) it follows that
is a complete first-order system of PDEs, as each of the rows corresponds to a generator of the Lie algebra Φg [34]. The number of functionally independent solutions is given by χ_{0}=n−r_{Φ}g, and let ψ_{1}x,⋯,ψ_{χ0}x be such a set of solutions. Considering the change of variables (after a reordering of the indices if necessary)
it follows at once that for 1 ≤ j ≤ χ_{0} the identities
are satisfied. Therefore y^{j} = α_{j} are constants for 1 ≤ j ≤ χ_{0}, and the system can be reduced to the equations
where the variables x^{1},⋯,x^{χ0} are written as functions of the independent coordinates x^{χ0+1},⋯,x^{n} and the constants α_{1},⋯,α_{χ0}, using the invariants ψ_{j}x in (19). By construction, the realization Φ̃ associated to the latter system is of maximal rank r_{Φ̃}g=n−χ_{0}.The rank of a realization Φ can be seen as a numerical invariant of the equivalence class of realizations determined by Φ. According to this result, a realization for which the condition χ_{0} = 0 holds shall be called non-reducible. In a certain sense, the reduced system associated to a system of type (1) comprises the main information concerning the (nonlinear) superposition principle, but leaving out the ignorable coordinates.
II. REALIZATIONS OBTAINED REDUCING LINEAR REPRESENTATIONS OF LIE ALGEBRAS
Any linear realization
of a Lie algebra g naturally gives rise to a representation of g, defined by the matrix
as a consequence of the correspondence between linear differential operators x^{i}∂∂x^{j} and elementary matrices E_{ij} [35]. Hence, if a given n-dimensional realization of a Lie algebra g is equivalent to a linear realization, then it is also related to a linear representation of order n. Conversely, any faithful linear representation F:g→EndR^{n} of a Lie algebra g determines a linear realization Φ_{F}:g→XR^{n} [36]. If X_{1},⋯,X_{r} is a basis of g and M_{Xα}=aijα the matrix corresponding to the endomorphism FX_{α}, the vector field Φ_{F}X_{α} is defined by
The matrix A_{ΦF}g of the realization is given by
In particular, if r_{ΦF}g=n, then χ_{0} = 0 and the realization cannot be reduced.
The procedure can also be easily adapted to complex representations. We recall that if Γ is a real irreducible representation of the (real) Lie algebra g, then
1. Γ is called of the first class, denoted by Γ^{I}, if Γ⊗_{R}C is a complex irreducible representation of g.
2. Γ is called of the second class, denoted by Γ^{II}, if Γ⊗_{R}C is a complex reducible representation of g.If a given n-dimensional irreducible representation Γ is of the first class, we can find an invertible matrix U such that F^{′}X_{α}=U^{−1}FX_{α}U is real for any X_{α}∈g, and the realization follows at once. If Γ is of the second class, the matrices satisfy the decomposition
and the corresponding real matrices (of double size 2n) are given by
In this case, the realization by vector fields in R^{2n} with coordinates x^{′}=x^{1},⋯,x^{2n} to be considered is
In the following, a realization Φ:g→XR^{n} will be called nonlinear if there exists at least one generator X_{α}∈Φg such that the matrix
is not constant. In addition, we say that the realization is genuinely nonlinear if it is not equivalent to a linear realization of g, while realizations that do not have this property will be called, by some abuse of notation, linearizable. We can therefore formulate the following criterion:
Proposition 1. IfΦ:g→XR^{n}is a nonlinear realization of the Lie algebragby vector fields inR^{n}andgdoes not possess a faithful n -dimensional real representation, then Φ is genuinely nonlinear.The standard example to this situation is the realization of sl(2,R) by vector fields on the real line given by ∂∂x,x∂∂x,x^{2}∂∂x that is not directly associated to a linear representation of the Lie algebra.These results suggest that linear representations F:g→EndR^{n} of Lie algebras can be used, by application of Lemma 1, to construct (genuinely) nonlinear realizations Φ of g in m < n variables, and such that Φ(g) corresponds to a Vessiot-Guldberg-Lie algebra L_{VG} of a first-order system of ODEs.In order to illustrate the potential usefulness of the reduction procedure, we show that the three equivalence classes of sl2,R-realizations as vector fields in the plane R^{2} can be obtained naturally by reduction of the adjoint representation. Over a basis X_{1},X_{2},X_{3}, the commutators of sl2,R are given by
The realization deduced from the adjoint representation ad is given by the vector fields
It is obvious that φ=x^{1}x^{3}−x^{2}{2} is an invariant of the realization, that actually coincides with the non-symmetrized Casimir operator of sl2,R. Considering the new set of variables y^{1}=x^{1},y^{2}=x^{2},y^{3}=φ, the constraint φ̇=0 implies that x^{3} can be expressed as x^{3}=C+x2{2}x1{−1}=C+y2{2}y1{−1} for a certain constant C. The two-dimensional realization extracted from the reduced system (21) is given by
In order to rewrite (29) in standard form, we consider the following change of coordinates in R^{2}:
In terms of z_{1},z_{2}, we obtain the vector fields
where α = Cλ^{−2}. Now, for the values α = 0, ±1, the vector fields (31) determine the three inequivalent realizations of sl2,R in R^{2} [9]. The realization for the value α = 0 further corresponds to the standard form of the realization associated to the 2-dimensional irreducible representation of sl(2,R) and is thus linearizable. The first-order system associated to the realization (31) is
Systems of the latter type have been extensively studied geometrically in the context of Lie-Hamilton systems in the plane [13]. Incidentally, we observe that the equivalence class of sl2,R as vector fields on the line is obtained by
showing that the realization, albeit not directly related to a representation, can be deduced by projection.
III. DIFFERENTIAL FORMS ANNIHILATING REALIZATIONS: EMBEDDINGS OF LIE ALGEBRAS
As a dual object to vector fields, differential forms can be used to obtain an alternative conclusion to that of Lemma 1, starting from certain given functions ψ and determining (finite-dimensional) Lie algebras annihilating the total differential dψ. Geometrically, this corresponds to consider involutive distributions in the sense of Fröbenius [15].
Corollary 1. If φ is an invariant of the realizationΦ:g→XR^{n}, thendφ∈Ω^{1}R^{n}is a 1-form annihilating the vector fieldsX_{1},⋯,X_{r}.Suppose that φ is an invariant of the realization Φg. It follows from the properties of one-forms that
showing that dφ annihilates the realization. Expressed in other terms, an invariant φ of a realization is merely a differential invariant of 0th-order of the local transformation group determined by the generators X_{α} [16].This reformulation also provides a criterion to construct realizations of subalgebras. Given Φ:g→XR^{n} and a subalgebra g^{′}⊂g, the restriction Φ|_{g^{′}}:g^{′}→XR^{n} defines a realization g^{′}, the rank of which satisfies the inequality
If r_{Φ}g<n, then Eq. (17) implies that
In addition to the realization invariants of g, additional solutions that are invariant with respect to the subalgebra generators may exist, allowing a further reduction of the realization for g^{′}. Without entering into details, we remark that the existence of such supplementary invariants for the restriction is closely related to the branching rules of representations subduced by the embedding g^{′}⊂g [17,18].We consider, for example, quadratic forms of the type
where ε_{i} = ±1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n and n ≥ 2. If p denotes the number of positive ε_{i}, it is immediate to verify that for each choice of the parameters, the form (37) is an invariant of the realization of the pseudo-orthogonal Lie algebras sop,n−p associated with the fundamental representation given by the matrices M_{ij} = ε_{i}E_{ij} − ε_{j}E_{ji}, the explicit vector fields being
The reduced realization of sop,n−p as vector fields in R^{n−1} can be taken as
Depending on the signature of the quadratic form Q, suitable coordinates can be introduced to simplify the expression of the vector fields M^{in}. Independently of this fact, if n = 2q + 1 is odd with q ≥ 3, the Lie algebras sop,2q+1−p do not possess a real representation of dimension 2q, while for even n = 2q with q ≥ 3, the Lie algebras sop,2q−p do not have a real representation of dimension 2q − 1 (see Refs [18] and  [19]). We conclude that the real Lie algebras sop,2q+1−p and sop,2q−p are realizable as Vessiot–Guldberg–Lie algebras of a nonlinear first-order system (1) in 2q and 2q − 1 variables, respectively. For the values q = 1, 2, realizations in less variables are possible due to the existence of additional isomorphisms between low-rank simple Lie algebras [17].As an example, for p = 0, q = 1, the realization of so(3) in the real plane follows reducing the adjoint representation in spherical coordinates. The vector fields in these coordinates are already in standard form
The main interest of the preceding property lies in its systematic application to the construction of realizations for non-compact real forms of simple Lie algebras, using appropriate embeddings into pseudo-orthogonal algebras, just as realizations of the exceptional Lie algebra G_{2} can be deduced from the embedding G_{2}⊂so(7).
Proposition 2. For any p + q ≥ 3, the real Lie algebrassup,qare realizable as Vessiot–Guldberg–Lie algebras of a genuinely nonlinear first-order system (1) in 2p + 2q − 1 variables.Let us consider first the case of sun. The fundamental representation Γ_{1} determined by the complex matrices
is of the second class. Using (26), a routine computation shows that the matrices of the real representation Γ1II are given by
It follows at once that any X∈sun is realized by a skew-symmetric matrix, showing that (41) defines an embedding sun↪so2n. This implies that the vector fields associated to the matrices (41) annihilate the quadratic form ψ=x1{2}+⋯+x2n{2}, and thus the reduction by ψ leads to a realization of sun in XR^{2n−1}. As for n ≥ 3 the algebra sun does not possess a real representation of dimension 2n − 1, and the realization is genuinely nonlinear.For sup,q, the argument is similar. If g=1,⋯p,1,−1,⋯q,−1 denotes the metric, defining the matrix G = Id_{2} ⊗ g, it follows at once that any X∈sup,q satisfies the identity
determining an embedding sup,q↪so2p,2q, from which the assertion follows at once.
A. Projection of realizations
As already observed, another possibility to generate new realizations from the given ones is to project on some subspace such that the resulting vector fields do not vanish and preserve the commutation relations.
It is well known that for any n ≥ 3, the Lie algebra sl(n,R) admits a nonlinear realization by vector fields in R^{n−1} that actually corresponds to the Lie point-symmetry algebra of the free-particle system ẍ=0 in (n − 2)-variables [20,21]. Interpreted within the preceding context, it follows that this realization can be deduced from the fundamental representation 1,0^{n−1} of sl(n,R). More specifically,
Proposition 3. For any n ≥ 2, the nonlinear realization ofsl(n,R)inX(R^{n−1})arises as a projection of the realization associated to the fundamental n-dimensional representation1,0^{n−1}.The fundamental representation is defined by the matrix condition Tr(A) = 0, where A is a real n × n-matrix. In terms of the elementary matrices E_{ij}, a basis of sl(n,R) is given by
The associated realization has maximal rank and hence does not admit a reduction by invariants. However, considering the change of variables
the vector fields of sl(n,R) are transformed as follows:
Taking now the projection p:X(R^{n})→X(R^{n−1}) determined by ξ^{n} → 0, it is straightforward to verify that the resulting realization satisfies the same commutators as (44)–(47). The standard realization as point symmetries of ẍ=0 is obtained considering appropriate linear combinations of the generators.Besides the relevance of this realization in the context of Lie point symmetries, its interest resides mainly in its application to certain subalgebras. Among these, the (semisimple) S-subalgebras constitute an interesting class [37].
Proposition 4. For any n ≥ 2, the non-compact symplectic Lie algebrassp(2n,R)admit a genuinely nonlinear realization as vector fields inX(R^{2n−1}).The realization associated with the representation Γ_{1}, and corresponding to the (singular) embedding sp2n,R⊂sl2n,R, is given by the vector fields
Considering now the change of basis (43), the realization in R^{2n−1} follows at once. As the lowest-dimensional real representations of sp(2n,R) is the fundamental defining representation Γ_{1}, we conclude that the realization subduced by that of sl(2n,R) is genuinely nonlinear. Another way to obtain the same result is to take the projection of the realization associated with Γ_{1} after a suitable change of coordinates.For low values of n we further obtain some interesting special cases. So, for example, due to the isomorphism sp(4,R)≃so(2,3), we find that the anti De Sitter algebra possesses a realization as Vessiot-Guldberg-Lie algebra of a nonlinear system of ODEs in R^{3}. It turns out that this realization can be obtained as the projection of the four-dimensional spin representation of so(2,3) that is real and has lower dimension than the defining representation [18]. It should be observed that embeddings into sl(n,R) and sp(2n,R) can be further used to derive realizations of the exceptional Lie algebras of types E_{6} and E_{7}, arising as S-subalgebras of the former [19].Another illustrating example of projection is given by the Lorentz algebra so(1,3). Considering the defining representation given by the matrix condition
with G=diag1,1,1,−1, the introduction of the coordinates
simplifies the realization invariant from φ = x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2} − t^{2} to r^{2}, and we immediately obtain the reduced realization in R^{3},
The restriction to so(3) provides the equivalence class of realizations in three variables, while through the projection with w → 0, we recover the realization in R^{2} given in (40). This projection is however not valid for the Lorentz algebra in these coordinates. By an additional change of variables u,v,w→ξ,θ,η, the details of which are skipped, the projection η → 0 gives rise to the equivalence class of realizations of so(1,3) in the plane,
It follows that the known realizations of semisimple Lie algebras in less than three variables are somehow related to an irreducible representation.Consequence: Any realization of a real semisimple Lie algebra g in n ≤ 2 variables arises either as the reduction by invariants or a projection of a realization associated to an irreducible representation of g.
IV. APPLICATION TO CONTRACTIONS OF LIE ALGEBRAS AND NONLINEAR FIRST-ORDER SYSTEMS
In this section, we illustrate how the combination of contractions of Lie algebras with the reduction or projection of realizations by vector fields can provide an effective description of parameterized first-order systems, where the isomorphism class of a corresponding Vessiot–Guldberg–Lie algebra depends on the values of the parameters. The idea of using contractions to relate various different physical models can be traced back to the classification of kinematical groups [22,23] and has been used more recently to interrelate the isometry groups of Cayley-Klein geometries [24], an approach that has been shown to be of interest in the context of integrable systems.
In this section, and using the kinematical groups in (2 + 1) and (3 + 1) dimensions as motivation, we show how the reduction procedure can be used to construct parameterized nonlinear first-order systems of ODEs admitting one of these Lie algebras as Vessiot–Guldberg–Lie algebras. Analyzing the lowest dimensional real representations of these groups, it is further justified that the realizations obtained are generically genuinely nonlinear.
For N = 4, consider the formal matrices
This matrix must be understood as a formal sum
where J_{1},J_{2},J_{3},K_{1},K_{2},K_{3} forms a basis of the real Lie algebra gε_{1},ε_{2} and Γ is a four-dimensional real representation of gε_{1},ε_{2}. Now, for any basis element X, the expression XΓ(X) means that the representation matrix Γ(X) of X is obtained from (52) replacing the generator X by 1 and the other basis elements by zero. This allows us to describe the representation simultaneously for a basis of gε_{1},ε_{2}. It is straightforward to verify that for the different values of the parameters ε_{j}, the matrix defines one of the following five non-isomorphic Lie algebras,
The inhomogeneous Lie algebra Iso3 appears as a contraction of so4 and so1,3, while Isl2,R is a contraction of so1,3 and so2,2. In this sense, ε_{1} and ε_{2} can be seen as contraction parameters, while they simultaneously determine the real forms of so4 [25]. The corresponding realization in R^{4} admits the invariant
in the coordinates y^{1},y^{2},y^{3},y^{4}. As ε_{1} ≠ 0, it is convenient to consider the set y^{1},y^{2},y^{3},φ as new coordinates, leading to a reduced first-order system in R^{3} and a realization of gε_{1},ε_{2}, where the dependence of the coordinate y^{4} is expressed as
In order to obtain a realization in standard form, and taking into account the form of the invariant φ, we consider the local change of variables
In terms of these coordinates, we have that y^{4}=C−ε_{2}z^{2}−ε_{2}ε_{1}z3{2}, and the realization is given by
As the Lie algebras sop,4−p do not have a faithful 3-dimensional real linear representation, it follows that the realization is genuinely nonlinear. A similar statement holds for the contracted inhomogeneous algebras. Therefore, for arbitrary functions F_{i}ti=1,⋯,6, the nonlinear system
admits gε_{1},ε_{2} as a Vessiot–Guldberg–Lie algebra, showing that the system can be solved by means of a nonlinear superposition principle.
A. Kinematical algebras in (3 + 1)-dimensions as Vessiot–Guldberg–Lie algebras
In analogy with the (2 + 1)-dimensional case, we show that the kinematical Lie algebras in (3 + 1)-dimensions naturally arise as Vessiot–Guldberg–Lie algebras of nonlinear systems of ODEs in R^{4}. A nonlinear realization as vector fields is obtained by the reduction of the standard five-dimensional linear representation of centerless kinematical algebras.
As is well known (see, e.g., Ref [23]), the classical kinematical Lie algebras can be described in terms of a 5-dimensional representation Γ:gε_{1},ε_{2},ε_{3}→EndR^{5} depending on three parameters ε_{i} that can be interpreted geometrically in terms of curvatures [26]. As before, we give a matrix M_{Γ} comprising simultaneously the representation matrices of the ten generators of gε_{1},ε_{2},ε_{3},
the matrix being explicitly given by
where J_{i},K_{i},P_{i},H with 1 ≤ i ≤ 3 are the generators of gε_{1},ε_{2},ε_{3} and the commutators are
The notation A,B=C is a shorthand for A_{i},B_{j}=ε_{ijk}C_{k}. The various kinematical algebras are given by the following values of the parameters ε_{j} [38],
It follows from Eq. (61) that, with the exception of the Carroll and static Lie algebras, the representation is faithful and that the generic rank A_{F} is equal to four. If the vector fields corresponding to the generators J_{1},J_{2},J_{3},K_{1},K_{2},K_{3},P_{1},P_{2},P_{3},H are denoted by X_{1},⋯X_{10}, the corresponding realization Φ_{F}:gε_{1},ε_{2},ε_{3}→XR^{5} is given by the matrix
their explicit expression being
The first-order system of ODEs determined by this realization is thus
As the rank of A_{ΦΓ} coincides with that of M_{Γ}, there exists an invariant of the realization. It is straightforward to verify that it is given by the quadratic form
as can be seen immediately from dφX_{i}=0. Applying the reduction procedure, the non-degenerate kinematical Lie algebras gε_{1},ε_{2},ε_{3} are nonlinearly realizable as vector fields in R^{4}, considering the change of variables y^{1},⋯,y^{5}=x^{2},x^{3},x^{4},x^{5},φ. In order to obtain a reduced realization that is valid for all the centerless kinematical algebras, we make the choice of expressing x^{1} in terms of y^{1},⋯,y^{4},C. This leads to
The generators of gε_{1},ε_{2},ε_{3} in these coordinates are
Considering now the transformation
we obtain the following realization in standard form:
where
For any functions F_{i}t, the nonlinear system determined by
possesses a nonlinear superposition principle, a Vessiot–Guldberg–Lie algebra being given by gε_{1},ε_{2},ε_{3}. We observe that for the de Sitter algebra so(1,4), as well as the Poincaré algebras, the realization is genuinely nonlinear, as none of these algebras admits a real representation of dimension four [27].
The vector fields Y_{1},⋯,Y_{6} further define, by restriction, a realization of the Lorentz algebra so(1,3), while Y_{1},Y_{2},Y_{3} gives rise to a realization of so(3). Considering the projection with z^{4} → 0, we obtain a realization of so(1,3) in R^{3} equivalent to the reduction of the realization of the defining representation. For so(3), considering the projection with z^{3} → 0 and z^{4} → 0, the resulting realization in R^{2} is equivalent to the standard one in the real plane [see Eq. (40)].
V. CONCLUDING REMARKS
Starting from various well-known generic properties of realizations of Lie algebras in terms of vector fields, it has been shown that many of the equivalence classes of realizations can be obtained from linear representations, either reducing the associated linear realization with respect to an appropriate invariant or by projection on some subspace. Further, once a given representation has been reduced with respect to some invariant, the standardization can provide various nonequivalent realizations, hence leading to non-equivalent parameterized first-order systems admitting a nonlinear superposition principle. It follows from this approach that any realization of real semisimple Lie algebras in n ≤ 2 variables can be obtained either as a reduction or a projection, irrespective of being a primitive or imprimitive realization [9,12]. A natural question that arises from the construction is whether any nonlinear realization of a semisimple Lie algebra by vector fields arises either as the reduction by invariants or the projection of a realization associated to a linear irreducible representation. An extension of this result to higher dimensions would provide at least an alternative systematic procedure to determine and classify the equivalence classes of realizations for this type of algebras, complementary to those methods based on homogeneous spaces (see, e.g., Refs [29] and  [30] and references therein).
A problem that seems worthy to be considered in more detail is the number of non-equivalent realizations obtained by standardization of a reduced realization associated to a linear (irreducible) representation of a (semisimple) Lie algebra and whether this number can be determined in dependence of the values of realization invariants. Among the various irreducible representations, the coadjoint representation plays a special role for semisimple Lie algebras, as the invariants of the corresponding realization can be identified with the Casimir invariants. The same conclusions hold for generic centerless Lie algebras. Further, the restriction of the realization to a given subalgebra can be further reduced, as invariants of the restriction correspond naturally to the subgroup scalars of the so-called “missing-label problem.” [28]
Using the relation between the various kinematical Lie algebras in (2 + 1) and (3 + 1) dimensions by contractions, realizations of these structures as Vessiot–Guldberg–Lie algebras of (genuinely) nonlinear systems have been obtained, further relating the various isomorphism classes by means of contractions of realizations. The realizations obtained for the kinematical algebras are potentially useful in the context of Lie-Hamilton systems in curved spaces, as the (3 + 1)-dimensional analog of recent work done in lower dimensions [31], In a more general frame, the contractions of semisimple Lie algebras can be used for the obtainment of realizations of solvable Lie algebras [25], for which a direct approach using faithful representations is more difficult, in the absence of a generic classification and criteria for the determination of minimal faithful representations [32]. Work in this direction is currently in progress.
