Structural and dielectric characteristics of Ba_{3}Ln_{3}Ti_{5}Nb_{5}O_{30} (Ln = La, Nd, Sm) filled tungsten bronze ceramics
In the present work, the structural, dielectric and relaxor ferroelectric properties were investigated for Ba_{3}Ln_{3}Ti_{5}Nb_{5}O_{30} (Ln = La, Nd, Sm) ceramics. The filled tungsten bronze phase with space group P4/mbm was confirmed for all compositions, while a small amount of secondary phase was detected in Ba_{3}Nd_{3}Ti_{5}Nb_{5}O_{30} and Ba_{3}Sm_{3}Ti_{5}Nb_{5}O_{30}. The typical relaxor ferroelectric behaviors were observed: a broad peak of dielectric constant shifting to higher temperatures and decreasing its magnitude with increasing frequency and the frequency dispersion obeying the Vogel-Fulcher relationship. The P-E (polarization-electric field) hysteresis loops were obtained for Ba_{3}Ln_{3}Ti_{5}Nb_{5}O_{30} (Ln = La, Nd, Sm) ceramics at low temperatures. The nanoscale ferroelectric 180° domains with strip-like shape were observed in the paraelectric matrix at room temperature, where the commensurate structural modulations were determined in the domains and incommensurate ones were determined in the matrix. The significant differences were determined between the present ceramics and Ba_{4}Ln_{2}Ti_{4}Nb_{6}O_{30} and Ba_{5}LnTi_{3}Nb_{7}O_{30} because of the different distribution patterns of A1 and A2 cations.
I. INTRODUCTION
Tetragonal tungsten bronze ceramics with a general formula [(A_{1})_{2}(A_{2})_{4}C_{4}][(B_{1})_{2}(B_{2})_{8}]O_{30} are one of the most important dielectric families [1]. They are composed of successive distorted BO6 octahedra. The octahedra share corners and form three different types of interstices (A1, A2, and C). For the filled tungsten bronze oxides, the trigonal interstice C is unfilled, while the square and pentagonal A sites are filled by cations. The adequate cationic sites offer the possibility of a large number of substitutions. Therefore, the filled tungsten bronzes can be modified to exhibit unique and interesting dielectric and ferroelectric properties due to the complex and tunable structure.
Lately, Zhu et_al made an elaborate study on the ferroelectric transition and low-temperature dielectric relaxations in filled tungsten bronzes [2]. The ferroelectric nature of Ba_{4}R_{2}Ti_{4}Nb_{6}O_{30} and Ba_{5}RTi_{3}Nb_{7}O_{30} (R = La, Nd, Sm) tungsten bronzes have been intensively studied [3–10]. In Ba_{4}R_{2}Ti_{4}Nb_{6}O_{30} compounds, it is supposed to obtain the ordered tungsten bronze structure, in which A2 (pentagonal) and A1 (tetragonal) sites are properly occupied by Ba and R ions. Therefore, the normal ferroelectric nature is generally expected in Ba_{4}R_{2}Ti_{4}Nb_{6}O_{30} tungsten bronze ceramics with smaller rare-earth ions [5–9], while Ba_{4}La_{2}Ti_{4}Nb_{6}O_{30} exhibited the relaxor behavior with diffuse ferroelectric phase transition nature [7,8,10]. For Ba_{5}RTi_{3}Nb_{7}O_{30}, the cation occupation is different from that in Ba_{4}R_{2}Ti_{4}Nb_{6}O_{30} because of the unequal number of Ba cations and A2 sites. Generally, four bigger Ba^{2+} cations preferentially occupy the A2 sites, and the A1 sites are cross occupied by the rest of Ba^{2+} and R^{3+} cations. In Ba_{5}RTi_{3}Nb_{7}O_{30} compounds, variation tendencies of ferroelectric nature are generally similar to those of Ba_{4}R_{2}Ti_{4}Nb_{6}O_{30}, except that the Ba_{5}RTi_{3}Nb_{7}O_{30} compounds show more diffuse or relaxor behavior because of the random occupancy of Ba^{2+} and R^{3+} in the A1 site [3–6]. A crystal-chemical framework was proposed as an excellent indicator for tetragonal tungsten bronze materials [11–13]. It is suggested that the increase of the average A-cation size will tend to form long-range polar order and normal ferroelectrics. Increase in the A1 site tolerance factor (t_{A}_{1}) favors an incommensurate modulated structure and it induces relaxor behavior. Moreover, the t_{A}_{1} is a greater driving force for relaxor behavior. This model is consistent with the results of the radius difference between A1 and A2 cations from theory.
Levin et_al, Stennett et_al, and Mao et_al reported incommensurate and commensurate modulation in filled tungsten bronze ceramics with the formula Ba_{4}R_{2}Ti_{4}Nb_{6}O_{30} (R = Bi, La, Nd, Sm, Gd) and Ba_{5}RTi_{3}Nb_{7}O_{30} (R = La, Nd) [7,14,15]. The primary parameter governing the phase transition nature and the transition temperature is the structural modulation through oxygen octahedral tilting [2]. In tetragonal tungsten bronze ceramics, a large radius difference between A1 and A2 cations (Δr) is considered to obtain the commensurate modulation, subsequently resulting in the normal ferroelectric nature with a high T_{C}. The normal ferroelectric will gradually become diffuse and relaxor as Δr decreases. The order/disorder in A1, A2, and B sites and their random cross occupancy will also have effects on the order of ferroelectric transition. However, for Ba_{3}Ln_{3}Ti_{5}Nb_{5}O_{30} (Ln = La, Nd, Sm), the filled tungsten bronze with a disordered distribution of Ba and Ln ions in the A2 site, the ferroelectric or relaxor have been rarely reported. The effects of the A1 site tolerance factor and the disordered distribution in the A2 site on the dielectric and ferroelectric nature should be an important issue for filled tungsten bronzes.
In the present work, the structural, dielectric, and ferroelectric characteristics of Ba_{3}Ln_{3}Ti_{5}Nb_{5}O_{30} (Ln = La, Nd, Sm) ceramics are investigated. The relaxor behaviours are determined at room temperature, and the ferroelectric behaviours are investigated at lower-temperatures. The ferroelectric domain structures are investigated to interpret the ferroelectric nature of the present ceramics.
II. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
Ba_{3}Ln_{3}Ti_{5}Nb_{5}O_{30} (Ln = La, Nd, Sm) ceramics were synthesized via a standard solid-state reaction process using BaCO_{3} (99.93%), La_{2}O_{3} (99.99%), Nd_{2}O_{3} (99.99%), Sm_{2}O_{3} (99.99%), TiO_{2} (99.99%), and Nb_{2}O_{5} (99.99%) powders as starting materials. La_{2}O_{3}, Nd_{2}O_{3}, and Sm_{2}O_{3} raw powders were pretreated at 1273 K in air for 3 h before weighing. These raw powders were milled in ethanol for 24 h using zirconia media. After drying, the mixtures were calcined at 1473–1623 K (depending on composition) in air for 3 h. With the addition of 6 wt. % polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as the binder, the reground powders were pressed into cylindrical compacts with 10 mm in diameter and 2 mm in thickness under a pressure of ∼98 MPa and then sintered in air at 1523–1573 K for 3 h to get the dense ceramics.
The crystal structure was verified by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis using Cu Kα radiation (PANalytical, Almelo, The Netherlands) at room temperature. The Rietveld structure refinement for the XRD data was conducted using the FULLPROF program.
The TEM samples were prepared by mechanical polishing followed by ion beam milling. The dark-field images and the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were obtained using a transmission electron microscope (JEM2100F, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan).
The dielectric properties of Ba_{3}Ln_{3}Ti_{5}Nb_{5}O_{30} (Ln = La, Nd, and Sm) ceramics were evaluated with a broadband dielectric spectrometer (Turnkey Concept 50, Novocontrol Technologies, Hundsangen, Germany) in a broad temperature (133–573 K) and frequency (1 Hz–1 MHz) range. The polarization-electric field (P-E) loops were measured with a precision materials analyzer (Premier II, Radiant Tech., Albuquerque, NM) in the temperature range from 193 to 293 K.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Figure 1 shows the structure refinement results for Ba_{3}Ln_{3}Ti_{5}Nb_{5}O_{30} (Ln = La, Nd, Sm) ceramics. The tetragonal tungsten bronze single phase with the space group P4/mbm is obtained for Ln = La, while a minor amount of NdTiNbO_{6} is detected for Ln = Nd, and SmTiNbO_{6} and Sm_{2}Ti_{2}O_{7} secondary phases are observed for Ln = Sm besides the tungsten bronze major phase. As the radius of Ln^{3+} diminishes from 0.136 nm (Ln = La) to 0.124 nm (Ln = Sm), the tolerance factors of filled tungsten bronze decreases from 0.930 to 0.897, and this leads to the reduced structural stability of filled tungsten bronze. For tetragonal tungsten bronzes, it is difficult to distinguish between P4/mbm and P4bm space groups using the XRD data, since they almost reach the same best fit. Considering their comprehensive performance and linear hysteresis loops at room temperature, they are suggested to belong to the centrosymmetric space group.
As shown in Table I, the cell parameters of Ba_{3}Ln_{3}Ti_{5}Nb_{5}O_{30} are calculated as a = b =12.3686(2) Å, c =3.9073(1) Å, V =597.758(19) Å^{3} for Ln = La, a = b=12.3604(3) Å, c =3.9081(1) Å, V =597.075(23) Å^{3} for Ln = Nd, and a = b =12.3532(1) Å, c =3.9110(1) Å, V =596.819(11) Å^{3} for Ln = Sm. As the rare earth ions change from La to Sm, the unit cell volume and lattice parameters a and b become smaller, while the lattice parameter c becomes bigger. Table II shows the selected bond distances and bond angles. The octahedra of Ti(1)/Nb(1)O_{6} have an 180° O(1)-Ti(1)/Nb(1)-O(1) bond angle and an equivalent Ti(1)/Nb(1)-O(4) bond length, while the bond angle of O(4)-Ti(1)/Nb(1)-O(4) is not equal to 90°, which means that the distortion of Ti(1)/Nb(1)O_{6} octahedra occurs. In the octahedra of Ti(2)/Nb(2)O_{6}, two Ti(2)/Nb(2)-O(3) bonds have equal lengths, indicating that the off-centre displacement of the Ti(2)/Nb(2) cations does not occur along the c-axis.
Considering the big difference in the ion radius between Ba^{2+} and Ln^{3+}, Ba^{2+} primarily occupies the pentagonal interstice and Ln^{3+} prefers to occupy the tetragonal interstice. Thus, almost all A1-sites are occupied by Ln^{3+}, and only a small portion of Ba^{2+} will go to A1-sites. The greater the ion radius difference between Ba^{2+} and Ln^{3+} is, the less A1-sites will be occupied by Ba^{2+}. It is consistent with the structure refinement results. The residual A2-sites are randomly occupied by Ba^{2+} and Ln^{3+}, which leads to the disordered distribution of cations. As the rare earth ions change from Sm to La, the t_{A}_{1} increases from 0.923 to 0.965, which is supposed to induce relaxor behavior. Also, the ferroelectric phase transition in tetragonal tungsten bronze ceramics is prominently influenced by the cation distribution, and the relaxor behavior is closely related to the disordering in cationic repartition [16]. Figure 2 shows the crystal structure along the c axis of Ba_{3}Ln_{3}Ti_{5}Nb_{5}O_{30}. The B1 and B2 sites contain Ti^{4+} and Nb^{5+} in a statistical ratio of 1:1. Most of the A1 sites are occupied by Ln^{3+}, and A2 sites are occupied by the rest of Ln^{3+} and Ba^{2+}.
The dielectric constant and loss of Ba_{3}Ln_{3}Ti_{5}Nb_{5}O_{30} (Ln = La, Nd, Sm) ceramics as functions of temperature at the frequencies varying from 1 to 1 MHz are shown in Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 3(d), the frequency dependence of dielectric constant in Ba_{3}Ln_{3}Ti_{5}Nb_{5}O_{30} ceramics at room temperature becomes more significant as the ionic radius of rare earth increases. Broad dielectric peaks with strong frequency dispersion are observed in all compositions. The dielectric peak temperature T_{max} moves toward the high-temperature side with the decrease of Ln^{3+} radius, namely ∼148 K for La^{3+}, ∼231 K for Nd^{3+}, and ∼309 K for Sm^{3+} at 100 kHz. There are two peaks for Ln = Sm. The first low-temperature permittivity peak is related to the relaxor character of ferroelectric transition. The second high-temperature permittivity peak is caused by thermal activation. The frequency dependent peaks in dielectric loss curves of Ba_{3}Ln_{3}Ti_{5}Nb_{5}O_{30} (Ln = Nd and Sm) ceramics show strong frequency dispersion, as well. The dielectric loss peaks appear at lower temperatures compared to the dielectric constant peaks. These behaviors are typical features of relaxor ferroelectrics with a diffuse phase transition. The modified Curie-Weiss law is used to evaluate the diffusion degree of these transitions [17]
where ε is the dielectric constant, ε_{max} is the peak value of ε at T_{max}, C_{1} is the modified Curie-Weiss constant and γ gives information about phase transition. The variation of log(1/ε–1/ε_{max}) with log(T–T_{max}) at 100 kHz for Ba_{3}Ln_{3}Ti_{5}Nb_{5}O_{30} is shown in Fig. 4. The γ values of Ba_{3}Ln_{3}Ti_{5}Nb_{5}O_{30} are 1.45, 1.20, and 1.51 for Ln = La, Nd, and Sm, respectively. The larger γ value of Ba_{3}Sm_{3}Ti_{5}Nb_{5}O_{30} is caused by the second dielectric anomaly at high temperatures. It makes the slope of the dielectric constant peak becomes flat. Considering the extrinsic factor, the γ value of Ba_{3}Sm_{3}Ti_{5}Nb_{5}O_{30} should be smaller. The γ value is the diffuseness exponent, which can vary from 1 (normal ferroelectric and following the Curie-Weiss law) to 2 (relaxor ferroelectric and complete diffuse phase transition), implying a diffuse phase transition and disordered system of Ba_{3}Ln_{3}Ti_{5}Nb_{5}O_{30} (Ln = La, Nd, Sm) ceramics.
The Vogel-Fulcher relationship is used to further understand the ferroelectric nature [18–20]
where f_{0} is the pre-exponential term, E_{a} is the activation energy, k_{B} is the Boltzmann constant, T_{max} is the peak temperature of the dielectric constant, and T_{f} is the static freezing temperature. The relationship represents the polar glasslike behavior with thermally actived polarization fluctuations above a static freezing temperature existing in the relaxor ferroelectrics [21–23]. As shown in Fig. 5, for all compositions, the frequency dependency of dielectric maximal temperature is well fitted by the Vogel-Fulcher relationship with fitting parameters: E_{a} = 0.105 eV, T_{f} = 73.93 K, f_{0} = 1.07× 10^{12} Hz for Ln = La; E_{a} = 0.337 eV, T_{f} = 88.38 K, f_{0} = 8.61 × 10^{16} Hz for Ln = Nd; and E_{a} = 0.096 eV, T_{f} = 211.04 K, f_{0} = 8.27 × 10^{9} Hz for Ln = Sm. These results of Vogel-Fulcher fitting indicate that the interaction of dipoles is similar to the spin-glass-like thermal activated process. According to the previous work [24–26], the Vogel-Fulcher analysis can result in unsystematic variation in values for the fitting parameters, and this is also the situation in the present work (e.g., the f_{0} values of the La and Sm samples vary by three orders of magnitude).
In tungsten bronze structures, the dominating role of off-center displacement of B-site ions in the ferroelectricity has been determined [5,14,27]. As shown in Fig. 2 and Table I, both A2 and B sites are randomly occupied. The cations with different valences and radii, which occupy the same site, will have an impact on the characters. It leads to the local compositional fluctuation and the unequally distributed local electric field and strain field. As a result, the distributed fields destroy the long-range ordering of Ba_{3}Ln_{3}Ti_{5}Nb_{5}O_{30} (Ln = La, Nd, Sm) on account of the off-center Ti/Nb dipoles. The dielectric relaxation arises, while macroferroelectric domains are broken into polar nano-domains [11].
The polarization-electric field hysteresis loops of Ba_{3}Ln_{3}Ti_{5}Nb_{5}O_{30} ceramics are obtained at 173 K. As shown in Fig. 6, three different methods have been used to evaluate the ferroelectric properties: the dynamic hysteresis mode (DHM) method, the dielectric leakage current compensation (DLCC) method, and the positive up-negative down (PUND) method [28]. In the DHM method, the hysteresis loops contain ferroelectric contribution-ferroelectric domain switching, non-ferroelectric contribution-dielectric and leakage contribution. In the DLCC method, the leakage contribution is taken out. In the PUND method, the hysteresis loops only contain ferroelectric contribution, and the remanent polarization for the PUND method is the lowest. Ba_{3}Nd_{3}Ti_{5}Nb_{5}O_{30} and Ba_{3}Sm_{3}Ti_{5}Nb_{5}O_{30} ceramics show a ferroelectric nature at low temperatures, while Ba_{3}La_{3}Ti_{5}Nb_{5}O_{30} ceramics show a paraelectric nature. Since the dielectric peak of Ba_{3}La_{3}Ti_{5}Nb_{5}O_{30} is close to 148 K, the ferroelectric transition of the ceramics should occur at lower temperatures.
As the remanent polarization is small, in order to further verify the relaxor ferroelectric nature, the hysteresis loops are measured by the PUND method from room temperature to 173 K. As shown in Fig. 7, all the Ba_{3}Ln_{3}Ti_{5}Nb_{5}O_{30} (Ln = La, Nd, Sm) ceramics show a paraelectric nature at room temperature. The remanent polarization is 0.0017 μC/cm^{2}, 0.0018 μC/cm^{2}, and 0.0032 μC/cm^{2} at room temperature for Ln = La, Nd, Sm, respectively. These small P_{r} values might be derived from errors of the measuring apparatus. When the temperature decreases to 193 K, the shape of hysteresis loops of Ba_{3}Nd_{3}Ti_{5}Nb_{5}O_{30} and Ba_{3}Sm_{3}Ti_{5}Nb_{5}O_{30} becomes regular and the remanent polarization becomes larger. The remanent polarization is 0.0016 μC/cm^{2}, 0.0064 μC/cm^{2}, and 0.020 μC/cm^{2} at 193 K for Ln = La, Nd, Sm, respectively. It indicates the weak ferroelectric nature of Ba_{3}Nd_{3}Ti_{5}Nb_{5}O_{30} and Ba_{3}Sm_{3}Ti_{5}Nb_{5}O_{30} at low temperatures. When the temperature decreases to 173 K, the remanent polarization of Ba_{3}Nd_{3}Ti_{5}Nb_{5}O_{30} and Ba_{3}Sm_{3}Ti_{5}Nb_{5}O_{30} is 0.016 μC/cm^{2} and 0.031 μC/cm^{2}, which is almost 10 times compared to the value at room temperature. It is suggested that the polarization comes from ferroelectric contribution. The shape of the hysteresis loop of Ba_{3}La_{3}Ti_{5}Nb_{5}O_{30} remains irregular and the P_{r} value is still 0.0014 μC/cm^{2} at 173 K. As the rare earth ions change from Sm to La, the A1 site tolerance factor becomes larger. It leads to a more relaxor behavior with lower transition temperature from incommensurate modulation to commensurate modulation.
As shown in Fig. 8, there are some nano-scale ferroelectric domains with strip-like shape dispersed in the paraelectric matrix, for all compositions in Ba_{3}Ln_{3}Ti_{5}Nb_{5}O_{30} (Ln = La, Nd, Sm) ceramics. The commensurate structure modulations along the [110] direction are detected in the nano-scale ferroelectric domains (see the left side insets in Fig. 8), while the incommensurate structure modulations are detected for the paraelectric matrix (see the right side insets in Fig. 8). The Ba_{3}Ln_{3}Ti_{5}Nb_{5}O_{30} ceramics exhibit disordered occupation of ions with different valences and ionic radii in both A and B sites. It leads to the local compositional fluctuation and an unequally distributed local electric field and a strain field. Therefore, the long-range ordering of Ba_{3}Ln_{3}Ti_{5}Nb_{5}O_{30} is destroyed by the distributed fields. The macroferroelectric domains are broken into polar nano-scale ferroelectric domains which are dispersed in the paraelectric matrix. Conversely, some local regions are more likely to form ferroelectric domains because of the compositional fluctuation. However, different grains have different grain orientations. The growth of the ferroelectric domain will be impeded by the grain boundary. Thus, the boundaries of ferroelectric domains coincide with the grain boundaries, which can be observed in Fig. 8. It should be noted that only an extremely small portion of the areas are polar domains at room temperature, and most regions present incommensurate modulation. In the filled tungsten bronzes, the ferroelectric phase transition changes from centrosymmetric to non-centrosymmetric with the decrease of temperature. At the same time, the modulation of the incommensurate structure of the oxygen octahedron will change into the commensurate modulation. It is reported that micro domains are observed in filled tungsten bronzes with the centrosymmetric space group above Curie temperature [26]. In spite of the existence of micro domains, the samples are still central symmetry macroscopically and show paraelectric. This is the reason why filled tungsten bronzes with the central symmetry space group do not show ferroelectricity at room temperature, while the ferroelectric microdomain can be observed. So, the Ba_{3}Ln_{3}Ti_{5}Nb_{5}O_{30} (Ln = La, Nd, Sm) ceramics do not show ferroelectricity in macro-scale at room temperature. When the temperature decreases, the nano-scale ferroelectric domains grow and form the long-range dipolar order, which leads to the gradual transition and broad dielectric peaks.
There are significant differences between the present ceramics and Ba_{4}Ln_{2}Ti_{4}Nb_{6}O_{30} and Ba_{5}LnTi_{3}Nb_{7}O_{30} because of different distribution patterns of A1 and A2 cations. In Ba_{4}Ln_{2}Ti_{4}Nb_{6}O_{30} compounds, Ba^{2+} and Ln^{3+} properly occupy the A1 and A2 sites and generally lead to the normal ferroelectric nature. Ba_{5}LnTi_{3}Nb_{7}O_{30} ceramics generally exhibit the relaxor behavior with diffuse ferroelectric phase transition nature, which are similar to those of Ba_{3}Ln_{3}Ti_{5}Nb_{5}O_{30}. However, the relaxor ferroelectric nature of Ba_{5}LnTi_{3}Nb_{7}O_{30} is derived from the disordered distribution in the A1 site, while the relaxor ferroelectric nature of Ba_{3}Ln_{3}Ti_{5}Nb_{5}O_{30} results from the disordered distribution in the A2 site.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
The single phase tetragonally filled tungsten bronze structure with the space group P4/mbm is determined for Ba_{3}La_{3}Ti_{5}Nb_{5}O_{30}, while a small amount of secondary phase in Ba_{3}Nd_{3}Ti_{5}Nb_{5}O_{30} and Ba_{3}Sm_{3}Ti_{5}Nb_{5}O_{30} is detected together with the tungsten bronze major phase. The typical relaxor behaviors are observed in the present ceramics, and the frequency dispersion obeys the Vogel-Fulcher relationship. The P-E loops are obtained for Ba_{3}Ln_{3}Ti_{5}Nb_{5}O_{30} (Ln = La, Nd, Sm) ceramics at low temperatures, and the nanoscale ferroelectric 180° domains with strip-like shape are observed in the paraelectric matrix for all compositions at room-temperature. There are significant differences between the present ceramics and Ba_{4}Ln_{2}Ti_{4}Nb_{6}O_{30} and Ba_{5}LnTi_{3}Nb_{7}O_{30} because of different distribution patterns of A1 and A2 cations.
