On the transient flow inside and around a deforming millimetre class oil droplet falling under the action of gravity in stagnant air
The liquid flow inside, and the induced air flow around, a falling droplet in stagnant air was numerically investigated using the volume of fluid method to describe the droplet interface. The droplet consisted of oil with the same surface tension and with viscosity as parameter. It was injected into stagnant air with an initial velocity of 1 m/s; therefore, the initial Weber (We = 0.14), Reynolds (Re = 141), and Bond (Bo = 2.4) numbers remained constant during the parametric study whilst the initial Capillary (Ca) and Ohnesorge (Oh) numbers varied by an order of magnitude from 0.46 to 4.6 and from 0.044 to 0.44, respectively. We examined the effect of viscosity on the flow inside, and around, the droplet as well as on the droplet deformation and its natural frequency. This investigation showed a strong dependence of the deformation with liquid viscosity. Specifically, the droplets achieved their final deformation in under-damped, for low viscosity, and in over-damped, for high viscosity, oscillation modes. After a critical time t_{crit} (or Re_{crit}), the instantaneous air flow symmetry was disturbed, initially in the wake and soon after in the interior of the droplet and in the vortex shedding downstream of the droplet. The air flow in the wake region detached from the droplet surface and resulted in a wake which was approximately 1.5 times longer and wider than the wake behind a solid sphere at the same Re number at steady state conditions. A roller-vortex structure (called rollex) was established upon injection in the immediate wake of the droplet, forming the necessary kinematic link between the directions of the internal circulation in the droplet (Hill vortex) and of the external recirculating air flow in the droplet’s wake. The droplet drag coefficients were compared with corresponding values used in droplet breakup models: although, ultimately, the droplet drag coefficient converged to the values given by the models, the initial magnitudes after injection were incorrect.
I. INTRODUCTION
A quantitative understanding of the physics of freely falling droplets, including the interaction between the internal liquid and external air flows leading to droplet deformation and hence variations in the drag force, is of interest because of applications ranging from meteorology to technology. The deformation can also lead to droplet breakup and atomisation, a phenomenon which is important in many engineering applications. For example, finer atomisation in liquid-fuelled combustion can contribute to improved homogeneity of the fuel mixture and hence avoid undesirable rich clusters.
The technological motivator of this work is the study of physical processes which take place inside the crankcase of an Internal Combustion (IC) engine. The crankshaft, which is driven by the pistons, is lubricated and is enclosed in the crankcase. The present study has relevance to the flow behavior of oil droplets that exist in the atmosphere of the crankcase.
Several non-dimensional numbers, shown in [Eqs.(1)–(5)], characterise droplet-flow interactions relevant to the present work [1–4]. The Weber number We [Eq. (1)] is the ratio of the surrounding fluid inertial/pressure forces that deform the droplet to the surface tension forces that contribute to retention of the spherical shape. The Ohnesorge number Oh [Eq. (2)] is the ratio of internal liquid viscous forces to the surface tension and liquid inertial forces. The Reynolds number Re [Eq. (3)] is the ratio of the external inertia forces of the flow to the flow viscous forces. The capillary number Ca [Eq. (4)] denotes the relative importance of the liquid viscous forces to the surface tension. The Bond (or Eötvös) number Bo [Eq. (5)] quantifies the relative importance of gravitational force acting on the droplet to the surface tension force,
where ρ_{g}, u_{0}, d_{0}, σ, μ_{l}, ρ_{l}, and ν_{g} are the density of the air, the slip velocity, the diameter of the droplet, the surface tension, the dynamic viscosity of the droplet, the density of the droplet, and the kinematic viscosity of the air, respectively.
There has been a great deal of both numerical and experimental study concerning the aerodynamics around spherical solid particles as a function of Re (see the study of Bergeles [5] for a fuller review), and these will not be discussed here, other than to note the qualitative characteristics of the wake relevant to this work. These are that with increasing Reynolds number there arises a vortex ring in the lee, followed by unsteadiness and ultimately flow separation and vortex shedding. Initially the flow retains an axial symmetry but ultimately becomes asymmetric with two counter-rotating vortices are formed, which eventually leads to the creation of a lift force acting on the sphere and the possibility of non-zero angular velocity. The underlying mechanisms that remain relevant to this work for the transition from one flow regime to the other are the initial dominance of viscosity, superseded by radial pressure instabilities associated with centripetal forces in the recirculating flow of the wake, with the one part feeding flow to the other part, and, finally, the existence of a ladder chain of overlapping loops of hairpin-like vortices.
The flow field around a falling droplet has superficial similarities to that around a falling solid sphere. However, distinct differences arise between the two cases due to droplet deformation, droplet oscillation, and the development of flow circulation within the droplet (known as the Hill vortex [6]), which leads to a non-zero velocity at the droplet-gas interface, at least for liquids without microscopic inclusions (such as tap water). A droplet under the influence of its surface tension and in the absence of any other forces tends to retain its spherical shape in order to minimize its surface area for a given volume. However, the shape of an initially spherical droplet, falling under the influence of gravity, changes and so do, also, the associated aerodynamic forces.
Wadhwa et_al [7] studied, numerically, the transient axis-symmetric flow around a deforming droplet over a range of Re, We and Oh numbers pertinent to conditions prevailing in fuel sprays in engines. Their method was capable of predicting droplet deformation with time and also calculating the form and viscous drag coefficients of the droplet with time. Results at a Re number of 150 showed that droplet deformation increased with increasing We number. For high We numbers, the droplet oscillates from oblate to spherical and prolate shapes with the drag coefficient increasing and decreasing, respectively, compared to the spherical one. Increasing the Oh number leads to a reduction in both droplet deformation and also droplet drag. For high We numbers, the exchange of momentum between the oscillating droplet and the surrounding gas phase is strong, leading to vortex separation and flow detachment in time. Drop drag is larger than for a solid sphere drag at a given Re number, and this difference increases with We number due to increased droplet oscillation and deformation.
Lim et_al [8] deduced the shape of a raindrop by solving the Laplace-Young equation for the equilibrium between surface and pressure forces, assuming hydrostatic equilibrium inside the droplet. The results indicate that, at the terminal droplet velocity and for droplets smaller than 800 μm diameter, the droplet retained its spherical shape, but, for larger diameters (higher Re number), it becomes distorted and obtains a prolate shape. For a droplet diameter of 2.3 mm, as in the present case, the ratio of the two axes of the deformed droplet at its terminal velocity was found to be approximately 0.89. Finlay [9] modeled droplets as two oblate semi-spheroids, with distance a being the common major semi-axis and b_{1}, b_{2} the minor semi-axes of the semi-spheroids. He derived equations for the deformation of droplets travelling with its terminal velocity (in steady state) which are functions of the Bo number.
Feng [10] determined the raindrop shape by computing a steady axis-symmetric solution of the Navier-Stokes equations and calculated the distorted shape of the droplet for various terminal Re numbers. The results for the droplet aspect ratio are in reasonable agreement with the published data, and, in particular, for a droplet diameter of 2.3 mm the calculated deformation ratio is 0.91. He also predicted the wake behind the distorted shape, without giving special attention was given to the droplet-wake interface.
The natural frequency of oscillation of a raindrop falling under the influence of gravity has been investigated experimentally by Gunn [11]. It was found that the aerodynamic forces initiate droplet oscillation and that the logarithm of the natural frequency of the droplet decreases linearly with the logarithm of the diameter. Rayleigh, as early as 1889, studied the small amplitude oscillation of an inviscid liquid droplet and deduced a relation for its natural frequency which, in general form, is written as [12]
where σ and R are the surface tension and the initial droplet radius, respectively. The zero-frequency mode corresponds to n = 1 (rigid sphere), whereas the first non-zero oscillation mode occurs for n = 2. Moreover, with the assumption that the natural frequency remains the same for the viscous case, for a viscous droplet the amplitude of the oscillation is damped exponentially,
where A, A_{0} are the amplitudes of the oscillation for a viscous and an inviscid droplet, respectively, t is (dimensional) time, and b_{n} is a damping factor equal to
where ν_{l} is the kinematic viscosity of the liquid phase. Prosperetti [13] presented a theory for the oscillation of viscous droplets immersed in another unbounded fluid according to which, if viscous effects are small compared to inertial ones, the oscillation frequency of the viscous droplet is modified to the following equation:
Perez et_al [14] demonstrated experimentally that, in the presence of a gravitational field, which leads to a deformed droplet, the frequency of oscillation is different from the one predicted for a spherical droplet, particularly for large droplets in which gravitational forces dominate surface tension forces. These results are used, later, as part of a validation exercise for the code.
The drag coefficient C_{d} of droplets has been the subject of investigation due to its importance in determining the trajectory of the droplet. First, the literature of drag coefficient C_{d} of liquid spheres and droplets in steady state are presented. Although the literature relating to steady flow past solid spherical and non-spherical particles is not reviewed (see the study of Bergeles [5] for that), investigations into accelerating and decelerating solid spheres are presented because of their relevance. Finally, the drag coefficients of the Taylor Analogy Breakup (TAB) [15] and Droplet Deformation Breakup (DDB) [16] models are shown.
Jalaal et_al [17] investigated the terminal velocity of non-spherical particles by solving the Basset-Boussinesq-Ossen (BBO) equation. The non-sphericity was incorporated in the drag coefficient, under steady state conditions, by using the correlation of Chien [18],
where ϕ = A_{s}/A_{ns} which is the ratio of the frontal area of a sphere to the frontal area of the non-spherical particle with the same volume. The results regarding the terminal velocity and drag coefficient C_{d} were in good agreement with numerical results found in the literature.
For flows ranging from solid and liquid spheres to spherical bubbles, Oliver and Chung [19] presented a numerical investigation of the steady laminar flow field at low to moderate Re numbers (Re = 0.5-50). The fourth order partial differential equation for the stream-function was numerically solved. For a liquid sphere, the strength of the internal circulation increases with the external Re number. The increased internal circulation for the drop is driven by the increased velocity gradient at the interface. The flow pattern of the wake and the drag coefficient C_{d} show little variation with the strength of the internal circulation, at least over this range of Reynolds number. The increased internal circulation will have, however, an increased effect on the heat and mass transfer rates through the droplet interface. For increasing external Re number, the separation angle of the limiting streamline increases as does the length of the recirculation zone. The predicted drag coefficient is in agreement with the predictive equation from the literature [20] with a modification for Re < 2.
Rivkind and Ryskin [20] investigated, numerically, the internal and external structures of the flow around a droplet in a uniform laminar steady axis-symmetric flow using a stream-function vorticity formulation. The drop was assumed spherical for all external investigated Re numbers up to 200 (based on air properties), above which the results indicated flow instabilities. For We > 1, a recirculating flow arises, detached from the drop surface; this region approaches the drop surface and expands with an increase in the viscosity ratio. At large viscosity ratios (μ_{l}/μ_{g}), the droplet internal Re number (based on liquid properties) has insignificant effect on either the external flow topology or on the drop drag coefficient C_{d}; they propose a predictive drag coefficient equation, which is a function of the external Re number and the viscosity ratio. The equation is valid for Re numbers in the range of 0.5–200.
Dandy and Leal [21] presented numerical solutions for a steady flow over an axis-symmetric deforming droplet for a wide range of Re, We numbers and also of viscosity and density ratios. Apart from the wealth of the detailed deformed droplet shapes that they presented, they also focused on the wake structure behind the droplet because there exists a separation zone, in contrast to the attached flow that is found in cases of solid spheres and bubbles. According to these authors, the motion of the fluid inside the drop appears to play an important role on the shape of the wake. With increasing viscosity ratio, the recirculation zone in the wake increases in width and moves closer to the lee of the drop due to the slowing of the interior flow. Also, for constant Re and We numbers, the shape of the droplet becomes more deformed with decreasing density (ρ_{l}/ρ_{g}) or viscosity (μ_{l}/μ_{g}) ratio.
Helenbrook and Edwards [22] studied the axis-symmetric flow over a droplet using a finite element method. The We and Oh numbers ranged from 0.1 to 50 and 10^{−4} to 10, respectively. They proposed a drag coefficient of the droplet that incorporates the internal circulation effect at higher Re numbers. The equations of Rivkind and Ryskin [20] and Helenbrook and Edwards [22] are for steady state conditions with constant droplet-air velocity, for example, when the particle or droplet achieves its terminal velocity.
There have been limited investigations for accelerating-decelerating flows of particles or droplets in which there may be a temporal evolution of the drag coefficient C_{d} during the time that the particle reaches its terminal velocity. Temkin and Mehta [23] investigated the drag coefficient of water droplets in accelerating and decelerating flows and showed that the unsteady C_{d} varies significantly from that of the steady state at a given Re number and that this is due to the size of the recirculation in the lee of the droplet; as might be expected, the larger it is, the higher the drag.
Temkin and Kim [24] proposed a drag coefficient for droplets, shown in [Eq. (11)], to model the transient behavior of the droplet based on experimental data derived from droplet motion induced by shock waves. There is significant difference between steady and transient drag coefficients, at a given Re number, which depends on the value of a parameter A_{c} only,
where K_{A} = 1 and A_{c} is given by the following equation:
Wadhwa et_al [7] describe the temporal evolution of C_{d} for a range of We numbers from 1 to 100. For Oh = 0.01 and We = 1, the value of C_{d} converges to a magnitude of C_{d} = 1. A drag correlation model was developed by Haywood et_al [25] that directly computes the drag force of the droplet as a function of the transient We and Re numbers, as shown in the following equation:
Accurate evaluation of droplet trajectory and breakup are major contributors to the prediction of fuel combustion efficiency and its spatial distribution; the Taylor Analogy Breakup (TAB) [15] and Droplet Deformation Breakup (DDB) [16] models, among others, are a widely used way of modeling the drag coefficient in commercial fluid dynamics packages. The models account for the state of the droplet in flight and estimate the droplet drag coefficient before or (and) after droplet breakup. For this reason, these models are considered in this work.
According to the TAB model, the deformation of a droplet is modeled as a one-dimensional, harmonic, damped oscillation with external forces. The model [Eq. (14)] incorporates a combination of drag coefficients corresponding to an initial spherical [Eq. (15)], and subsequent oblate shape, droplet as a function of the initial Reynolds number, as follows:
where the drag coefficient of a sphere C_{d,S} is given by [Eq. (15)] and the deformation contribution by y′ as determined from the TAB model,
The DDB model takes also into consideration the change in the frontal area of the droplet due to the aerodynamic force. The proposed drag coefficient C_{d} is shown in the following equation [26]:
where α is the deformed droplet radius and r_{0} is the initial droplet radius.
The preceding literature survey shows that transient effects, which arise in many applications, are neither adequately investigated nor are these presently considered in breakup models, such as the TAB and DDB. The temporal evolution of the Hill vortex, its bridging with the droplet wake and also the effect of viscosity require further deliberation because these are all likely to be implicated in the trajectory and drag coefficient of the deforming droplet.
The purpose of the present numerical investigation is to evaluate the detailed physics of the flow around a droplet injected into a stagnant air surrounding, in particular details that cannot be easily observed experimentally (i.e., internal circulation), and assess the ability of current droplet breakup models to deliver accurate predictions. In addition, this investigation evaluates the importance of the omitted physics (i.e., temporal evolution of drag coefficient and interaction of the Hill vortex with the droplet wake) in current breakup models. The investigation shows large discrepancies in the drag coefficient between the present study and of the breakup models, especially in the time just after injection. Additionally, it reveals the existence of a newly defined roller-vortex (“rollex”), linking the internal circulation of the droplet with the wake.
The present work examines, through computations, the deformation process, oscillatory behavior, internal liquid, and external air flow associated with the droplet injected into a stagnant environment, with viscosity as parameter. The initial Weber (We = 0.14) and Reynolds (Re = 141) numbers are common to all the cases studied, whilst the Capillary (Ca) and Ohnesorge (Oh) numbers varied by an order of magnitude from 0.46 to 4.6 and from 0.044 to 0.44, respectively. The value of the surface tension of the droplets was constant so as to investigate only the effect of the viscosity on the deformation process.
The text first describes the numerical methodology of the computations. It then presents a grid dependence study, supported by numerical findings for the convergence rate of the numerical solution. Afterwards, an initial qualitative description of the phenomena that arise is given, and results regarding the droplet deformation and oscillation for various cases are discussed and compared to existing published work, along with the new findings. We further investigate, in detail, the breakdown of flow symmetry at a critical Re_{crit}, the external flow near the lee of the droplet, and the topologically necessary roller-vortex (rollex) linking the air flow at the lee of the droplet with that of the internal Hill vortex. The paper ends with a summary of the main findings.
II. NUMERICAL METHODOLOGY
There are two main approaches to numerically simulate a flow around a deformable droplet, and these are based on methodologies to either track or capture the free droplet surface: interface tracking (also referred to as surface, or front, tracking) and interface capturing (also called volume tracking). The interface tracking methods [27,28] are Lagrangian methods, employing a computational mesh which moves with the free surface, following an individual fluid parcel as it moves through space and time. Although these methods result in a sharp interface, they encounter serious problems [29,30] in cases when the moving mesh becomes severely distorted due to large deformation of the interface. On the other hand, the interface capturing methods use an Eulerian mesh, fixed in space, which calculates the position and movement of the interface. This can be achieved in three different ways: by tracking particles, by introducing a level-set function or by tracking fluid volumes using an indicator function.
The present study employs a finite volume method which is 2nd order accurate in space and 1st order accurate in time for the numerical solution of the governing transport equations of the flow field. The computational study is performed in the OpenFOAM framework [31]. For the modeling of the interface, the code uses the Volume of Fluid (VoF) method, an interface capturing method proposed by Hirt and Nichols [32], that introduces an indicator function, the volume fraction α. It tracks the volumes of two immiscible fluids by solving a transport equation. The values for the indicator function are limited to either zero or one, associated with a particular phase, and varying discontinuously across the interface. The indicator function is used to indicate cells filled with fluid of phase 1 and its volume fraction in the cell or cells filled with fluid of phase 2. Without loss of generality, it is assumed that α = 1 for the liquid phase and α = 0 for the gas phase, as indicated in Fig. 1.
The VoF methods have the advantage of conserving mass (thus, during the iterative solution of our calculations, droplet mass loss was less than 0.09% at all times) but have the disadvantage of not being capable of ensuring a sharp interface between the different phases because of numerical diffusion [33]. Therefore, various numerical techniques have to be employed to alleviate the problem.
In the VoF method, the fluid is considered to be homogeneously mixed with density [Eq. (17)] and dynamic viscosity [Eq. (18)], calculated as
The transport equations, which describe the flow field, are the continuity equation,
and the momentum conservation equation,
where U, p, T, and f_{b} are the flow velocity, pressure, rate of strain tensor, and body forces, respectively. The rate of strain tensor is expressed as shown in the following equation:
In order to simplify the boundary conditions, a modified pressure p_{rgh} is used, which is defined as follows:
where p is the static pressure and x is the position vector. Brackbill et_al [34] have developed the Continuum Surface Force (CSF) model to account for the surface tension forces, which arise at the interface; this force per unit volume is expressed by [Eq. (23)] which is introduced into the expression f_{b} in Eq. (20),
where σ is the surface tension and κ is the mean curvature defined as
Equation (24) accounts for cases with uniform (constant) surface tension only, as in the case of a droplet in ambient temperature, and therefore Marangoni type flows are not considered. The transport equation of the indicator function α for the two phases is
Assuming that the velocity U across the interface is a weighted average of the liquid U_{l} and gas U_{g} velocities, then
By rearranging the terms, the final transport equation of the indicator function Eq. (27) is derived,
where U_{c} = U_{l} − U_{g} is the relative or compression velocity. The last term in Eq. (27) is designated as the interface compression term, and it is active only across the interface region (0 < α < 1). This term is an additional artificial convection term to the transport equation of the indicator function, and it greatly contributes to the higher resolution of the interface [31].
The pressure-velocity coupling is performed by the PISO (Pressure Implicit with Splitting of Operators) algorithm, introduced by Issa [35]. PISO was employed with an initial guess for the pressure field of the computational domain linked with multiple correction iterations (corrector steps). In the present investigation, the latter was found to be of importance for the convergence of the solution.
When using interface capturing methods, a difficulty reported in the literature, with regards to the flow field simulation around droplets, is the appearance of spurious velocities across the interface of the droplet, the lack of conservation of mass of the droplet and inaccurate pressure-velocity coupling of the equations. Spurious velocities appear across the interface of the droplet, particularly for zero or small initial droplet velocities, creating unrealistic droplet behavior [28]. Such parasitic currents are an inherent feature of the VoF methodology and arise due to numerical errors from the calculation of curvature at the interface and consequently of the pressure forces. Also, there may be an imbalance between the surface tension force and the pressure-gradient terms due to the inability of the VoF methodology to treat the discontinuity on the interface.
This is the reason why bounded, higher order discretisation schemes for the divergence terms along with time step control were found to be necessary in the present investigation, as also in the study of Deshpande et_al [36] The time step Δt per iteration was chosen according to the following equation:
where τ_{μ} and τ_{ρ} are shown below,
with Δx being the spatial discretisation of the mesh. The Courant number (Co), or Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition, denotes how many computational cells a fluid particle travels per iteration and is shown in the following equation:
where u is the magnitude of the fluid velocity at the cell. If the time step of the solution is chosen from Eq. (28) then that leads to a Co number less than 0.25 in each time step (Co < 0.25), which means that the Co number of every computational cell of the domain is less than 0.25 contributing to the minimization of the spurious velocities across the interface of the droplet.
The convergence and stability of VoF methods are very sensitive to and dependant on the correct solution of the equation of the volume fraction: so it was found imperative to solve the indicator function equation in n_{sc} sub-cycles within a single time step. This means that the time step of the implicit process for the solution of the transport equation of the indicator function α [Eq. (27)] is n_{sc} times smaller than the temporal discretisation of the momentum conservation equation [Eq. (20)], as indicated in the following equation:
where Δt is the temporal discretisation of the Navier-Stokes equation, Δt_{sc} is the time step for the solution of the indicator function α, and n_{sc} is the number of temporal sub-cycles.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Cases description and grid independence study
The present investigation examines, numerically, phenomena that take place during the injection of a liquid droplet, with a parametric investigation of liquid viscosity, into a stagnant air surrounding. Three kinematic viscosities for the liquid droplet were chosen (10, 50, 100 cS). The initial diameter of the droplet was 2.3 mm, which is a typical droplet size found inside a crankcase, and its initial injection velocity was 1 m/s for all cases. The normalization of the results was based on the initial diameter and velocity of the droplet. The We number [Eq. (1)] was 0.14, and the initial Re number [Eq. (3)] was 154, leading to a range of Ca [Eq. (4)] numbers from 0.5 to 4.6, once again based on the initial conditions.
The Oh number [Eq. (2)] ranged from 0.045 to 0.45; since the surface tension was constant, this change of the Oh number was due to changes in the liquid viscosity. For this range of Oh numbers, especially for the low Oh numbers, the viscosity is unimportant as far as breakup is concerned, while for Oh > 1 the viscous effects become increasingly important. However, the rate of deformation of the droplet, as well as its oscillation frequency, is expected to decrease with the increase in viscosity.
The duration of the computations was 253 ms, which was found to be long enough for the break in symmetry of the wake of the droplet to develop or, equivalently, the non-dimensional time duration was approximately t^{*} = 110 with the definition of non-dimensional time being based on the flow transit time using the initial conditions of velocity and diameter [Eq. (32)]. During that time period, the droplet Re and We numbers increased due to the acceleration of the droplet. At the end of the computations, the We number became 1.31, 1.27, and 1.21 for increasing liquid viscosity, meaning that only droplet deformation occurs and not breakup because the We number is lower than the critical We_{crit} = 12 [1] for all cases. The Re number became 457, 453, and 446 showing that the external air flow is expected to be a transitional one with vortex shedding appearing at the wake, given experience of the flow past solid spheres [37],
A summary of the computational cases and the associated liquid properties, as well as the oscillation frequency of the droplet, ω^{*}, normalised with the initial flow conditions, is presented in Table I, and the non-dimensional numbers of the flow field can be found in Table II.
The computational domain is shown in Fig. 2. The height of the domain was 45 droplet diameters and the width 7 droplet diameters. The boundary conditions of the present study are specified in Table III.
The mesh employed in the present investigation was Cartesian, three-dimensional, static with 12 × 10^{6} computational cells. A domain around the droplet was refined in order to achieve a sharper and better resolved interface; each droplet diameter was represented by approximately 65 grid points, a number derived after numerical experiment to investigate grid dependence (Fig. 3).
The global Co number was limited to 0.25 (Co < 0.25), and, for the present investigation, the average time step was about 10 μs for the solution of the momentum conservation equation. The number of computational cells is considered satisfactory for the specific application as the droplet interface did not get severely deformed. Because both the internal and external flows were solved, and at the same time there was a constraint on the Co number, the denser the computational mesh at the refined region, the more computationally expensive was the calculation not only because of the increased number of grid points but also more importantly because of the reduced temporal discretisation to keep the Co less than 0.25. A number of five sub-cycles (n_{sc} = 5) were used, so the average time step in the solution of the indicator function α was 2 μs. The CPU time needed for the numerical solution of each case was about 500 CPU hours running on an 8-core, 2.6 GHz workstation.
To investigate whether the numerical solution was close to being mesh independent, the case with the least viscous droplet (case 1) was simulated using a denser mesh of 20 × 10^{6} computational cells. In this part of the study, the region around the droplet only was refined, leading to nearly twice the number of computational cells in the interior of the droplet. The results of the two computations were compared in terms of droplet velocity magnitude [Fig. 4(a)] and x-component momentum [Fig. 4(b)]. In Fig. 4(a), the droplet velocity up to time t^{*} = 30 is presented for the coarse and fine meshes with the difference being smaller than 1%. Figure 4(b) illustrates the x-momentum (i.e., perpendicular to the main direction of fall of the droplet, see the figure for the definition of the coordinate system) of the left hemisphere of the droplet. The x-momentum of the hemisphere is normalized with the initial momentum of the droplet in the direction of gravity; it is found that the maximum difference is less than 0.02%.
The number of PISO loop corrections was varied, as was also the number of sub-cycles for the indicator function, for the least viscous case with the mesh of 12 × 10^{6} computational cells. The effect of the number of sub-cycles of the indicator function transport equation on the average droplet velocity can be seen in Fig. 5(a), where five sub-cycles were required for minimising spurious currents, obtaining a temporally grid independent solution. Moreover, it was noticed that for the most viscous droplet (case 3); in order to achieve a stable solution, additional PISO loop corrections had to be employed.
As can be seen in Fig. 5(b), for this case (case 3), the droplet velocity was found to depend on the number of PISO loops. Eight PISO loop corrections, with five temporal sub-cycles, were found to be necessary in order to get a stable solution for the velocity of the droplet.
Regarding the ability of the numerical method, Bergeles’ thesis [5] contains, for the same computational arrangement and discretisation schemes applied to the least viscous droplet, a case with the initial droplet velocity being set to 5 m/s (other boundary conditions unchanged) which is close to the terminal velocity, 5.6 m/s, of a water droplet of the same droplet diameter, and dispersed phase (i.e., air) according to Batchelor [6] and Clift [2]. The computations confirmed that the acceleration of this least viscous droplet was both small and approximately constant (as it should have been), resulting in very small and slow changes in the velocity of the droplet, suggesting that the droplet velocity was indeed close to this theoretical value with the implication that the drag was also correctly established.
B. Qualitative description of the flow field
Figure 6 presents snapshots of the flow field and droplet shape at various instants of time of the least viscous droplet (case 1). The 2.3 mm droplet is released with a velocity of 1 m/s into an initially stagnant surrounding. Immediately, the droplet deforms and acquires an oblate spheroid shape which is in agreement with the study of Helenbrook and Edwards [22]. Then, the droplet starts oscillating at its natural frequency. At time t^{*} = 6.1, a symmetric wake has been established and the Hill vortex starts to form while the droplet achieves its maximum lateral deformation; at time t^{*} = 12.2, the wake has increased its size and remains symmetric, the formation of the Hill vortex has finished, and the droplet continues translating solely in the direction of gravity. At t^{*} = 45, the wake develops an asymmetry; however, the flowfield around the droplet is only weakly asymmetrical, so the droplet continues to translate only in the direction of gravity (i.e., the vertical), with the increasing wake length. At a critical time t_{crit} (or, equivalently, at a critical Re number Re_{crit}), t^{*} = 46.5, which varies for each case, an asymmetric liquid flow in the interior of the droplet is also created, which leads to the movement of the droplet in the other two orthogonal directions, perpendicular to the direction of gravity, as well as in the direction of gravity. The time in-between the wake symmetry break and the trajectory symmetry break increases with viscosity. Additionally, vortex shedding appears in the wake (t^{*} = 61.7), which is linked with the perturbation of the droplet’s surface and to Hill vortex asymmetry (t^{*} = 90.4).
As explained by Dandy and Leal [38], for kinematic reasons there must be an intermediate vortex, much like an idler gear, that links the direction of the internal circulation of the droplet with the direction of circulation in the wake, which is in the opposite sense to that in the Hill vortex. Figure 7(a) represents the flow around a solid sphere illustrating an attached wake structure, with the separation line originating from the surface of the solid sphere. Under the assumption that the wake behind a solid sphere and that behind a droplet have the same geometry (both are attached to the rear surface), the result derived is illustrated in Fig. 7(b). Due to the existence of the internal droplet flow, however, the indicated flow kinematics is an implausible scenario.
Dandy and Leal [38] hypothesised two possible geometries for the wake of the droplet which would solve the kinematic issue explained earlier. Figure 8(a) illustrates a detached wake structure and Fig. 8(b) an attached wake, like that of a solid sphere but with an additional roller-vortex, which links the internal circulation (Hill vortex) to the external recirculation zone in the wake of the droplet. The indication of the existence of such secondary internal motion for reasons of flow topology was also shown by Clift et_al [2] In both cases, the kinematic conditions (constraints), due to the non-zero velocity at the droplet interface, are not violated. Regarding the results of the present computational study, as can be seen in Fig. 6, the roller-vortex (rollex) is in fact present, mainly outside the droplet, as will be discussed in more detail later. A sketch of the rollex found in the present study is shown in Fig. 9, showing a combination of the potential solutions proposed by Dandy and Leal; there is no separation point on the rear surface of the droplet, and there is a secondary recirculation structure linking the internal circulation with the wake, the rollex.
For the better understanding of the phenomena that take place after the injection of a droplet, the following flow variables have been investigated. The droplet is considered to be the summation of the masses of all computational cells with VoF coefficient greater than 0.5 (α > 0.5). All the variables are normalized by the initial conditions of the droplet (u_{0} = 1 m/s, d_{0} = 2.3 mm). At each computational time step, the droplet size in any direction is calculated to assess the droplet deformation; we then calculate the centre of mass and the centre of mass of the two hemispheres (or more accurately, the two major-axis semi ellipsoids) of the droplet, defined by a plane with normal orthogonal to the gravity vector and passing through the droplet centre of mass. All velocity and momentum components of these centres of mass were calculated to quantify the flow asymmetry as well as the droplet oscillation; relevant definitions are shown in Fig. 10. The droplet velocity and the trajectory of its centre of mass are presented in Fig. 10(a).
The droplet’s displacement was calculated as the displacement of the centre of mass of the droplet from the notional axis of the initial trajectory, normalised with the initial droplet diameter d_{0}. Additionally, the deformation of the droplet was calculated as follows. Let d_{y} be the Feret’s diameter of the droplet in the direction of gravity and d_{x}, d_{z} be the droplet Feret’s diameters in the directions perpendicular to that of gravitational acceleration, as shown in Fig. 10(b). The deformation of the droplet in the direction i was calculated as the ratio of the droplet’s Feret’s diameter at that instant to the initial droplet diameter in the following equation:
The oscillatory behavior of the droplet was investigated by considering the droplet as two hemispheres (left and right). The x-component of momentum (i.e., perpendicular to the direction of gravity) for each hemisphere was calculated according to Eq. (34) and normalised with the initial component of droplet momentum in the direction of gravity [Fig. 10(c)],
where m′ and ux′ are the mass and the x-direction velocity of right hand-side hemisphere, respectively, V_{i} is the cell volume, and similarly m″ and ux′′ are the mass and the x-direction velocity for the left hand-side hemisphere. The horizontal velocity profile (x-direction) was investigated for the better understanding of the breakdown of symmetry [Fig. 10(d)].
C. Droplet fall velocity and horizontal trajectory
For the dimensionless duration examined, up to t^{*} = 110, Figs. 11 and 12 present the velocity and acceleration of the droplets for all cases. The droplet’s velocity and the acceleration are normalized with the injection velocity (u_{0} = 1 m/s) and gravitational acceleration (g = 9.81 m/s^{2}), respectively.
Figure 11 shows that the droplet of the least viscous liquid (case 1) achieves—marginally—the highest velocity by the end of the calculation time. The differences in velocity as compared with the other two cases are small, and this is due to its oscillatory behavior, mainly of the least viscous droplet. Specifically, the maximum frontal surface area is achieved faster with increasing viscosity, leading to lower accelerations and ultimately lower velocity by the end of the computation.
The droplets’ acceleration generally decreases with increasing time as shown in Fig. 12. However, for case 3 and, to lesser extent, case 2, there is an initial period, up to approximately t^{*} = 5, during which the acceleration increases after injection; this is due to a transition period during which the flow field develops. The acceleration of the most viscous case is the lowest because the droplet achieves its maximum frontal area immediately upon injection.
Figure 13 illustrates the temporal evolution of the frontal (projected) area of the droplet for all three cases non-dimensionalised with the droplet initial frontal area A_{0}. Upon injection, there is a steep increase in the frontal area up to values of 1.12, for all cases examined; then a transient period follows and, for the least viscous case, the frontal area oscillates. This increase in the frontal surface has to be accounted for in the drag term of droplet breakup models. Subsequently, the area increases much less rapidly until at about t^{*} = 60, when the droplet deformation unexpectedly decreases abruptly, before resuming a fluctuating increase in area.
The terminal velocities of the droplets are 6.3, 6.4, and 6.5 m/s for the least, moderate, and most viscous cases based on the study of Clift et_al [2]; the calculation is based on the terminal Re number of the droplets and does not account for their deformation. Due to the high computational cost of the investigation, it was not possible to pursue the calculation until the droplets reached these terminal velocities. By the end of the computations, the droplets had achieved approximately 50% of their terminal velocity, and it is believed that important phenomena are captured over this duration and that, for the remaining time until the droplet reaches its terminal velocity, there would be no significant differences in the flow field and droplet behavior, as is already shown by the results.
The non-dimensional displacements of the droplet centre of mass (CoM) normal to the gravitational vector as a function of time for all cases are presented in Fig. 14. Until t^{*} = 46.5, 47.2, and 49.5 for increasing liquid viscosity, all three droplets translate only in the direction of gravity. After this non-dimensional time, which slightly differs with the value of the liquid viscosity, each starts moving in the horizontal direction (i.e., in the direction normal to the gravity vector) as well. The threshold of recording the horizontal movement of the droplet was a 2% displacement of the droplet CoM from the nominal vertical axis of the initial trajectory. With an increase in viscosity, the critical time t_{crit} at which droplets started to move in the horizontal direction increased slightly while the droplet motion within the horizontal plane does not seem to have a specific pattern; this may suggest a chaotic behavior in the movement of the droplet, at least in those directions. The Re_{crit} number, corresponding to the t_{crit} time, is found to be approximately the same for all three viscosities and equal to Re_{crit} = 220. Interestingly enough, the time at which the droplets start to move on the horizontal plane does not coincide with readily detectable departure from symmetry of the wake of the droplet. The latter is also associated with the development of an asymmetrical Hill vortex inside the droplet and will be discussed later.
D. Droplet deformation
The temporal evolution of the droplet deformation in three directions for all investigated viscosities is shown in Fig. 15. For all cases, during the initial transient associated with the injection, the droplets are rapidly deformed during an oscillatory process, by a few percent, toward an ellipse-like shape with a major axis aligned with the horizontal direction, (i.e., x-direction, as is expected for this range of Re number) over a duration corresponding to less than a couple of external flow convective time scales. Subsequently, after this initial oscillatory transient has passed, the droplets continue to deform at a more-or-less steady rate associated with the increase in the droplet velocity as these continue to accelerate under the action of gravity. For cases 1 and 2, shown in Figs. 15(a) and 15(b), the oscillations are damped out by t^{*} = 20 and t^{*} = 10, whereas the most viscous case has no oscillation but rather a monotonic deformation. The final deformation is in agreement with the value reported in the literature at the same Re number for a deformed droplet. This agreement indicates that the droplet acquires most of its final, distorted shape almost immediately after its interaction with the gas phase and much earlier than it achieves its terminal velocity.
The deformation of the droplet in the horizontal (x- and z-) directions is identical during the injection transient and immediately afterwards, indicating that the flow field is axis-symmetric, as shown in Sec. III C, up to a critical time t_{crit} ≈ 60 when symmetry breaks down. After that time (t^{*} > t_{crit}), the droplet deforms asymmetrically and, apparently, randomly: note that no particular significance should be ascribed to the differences in behavior between the x- and z-directions given that these are not privileged coordinates after the breakdown from the initially axis-symmetric flow. Moreover, it can be seen that, for all cases, the droplets are deformed to a greater extent in the vertical (y-axis) direction than in the other two axes, which can be interpreted as merely a consequence of the conservation of the volume of the droplet. Figure 15(c) shows the droplet deformation of the most viscous droplet presenting a monotonic distortion toward the final shape without any oscillation; the ratio of minor to major axis is larger than in case 1 with a value of 0.91. This value of deformation is also in good agreement with Beard [39], who predicts a value of 0.90. However, it does not agree with Finlay [9], who gives a value of 0.97 for the same flow conditions.
E. Droplet oscillation
Despite the fact that the horizontal (x- and z) directions are not privileged coordinates in this flow, in accordance with the purely vertical motion of the droplet during the injection transient, Fig. 16(a) shows the x-momentum of the right and left hemispheres of the droplet [defined in Fig. 10(c)] indicating that the two parts oscillate in anti-phase. Table IV presents the natural frequency ω_{n}, damping factor b_{n}, and oscillation frequency ω found in the literature as well as the oscillation frequency found in the computations. The expression for the damping coefficient given in b_{n} [Eq. (8)] takes the value of b_{n} = 37 and b_{n} = 189 for cases 1 and 2 and results in an oscillation frequency of ω^{*} = 0.121 and ω^{*} = 0.105 for the two cases. These values are close to the values, 0.123 and 0.102, found in the literature (Table IV).
For the most viscous case, shown in Fig. 16(c) and to a lesser extent in the intermediate viscosity case [Fig. 16(b)], the initial increase in the x-momenta of the two hemispheres of the droplet is damped out monotonically. The b_{n} factor is greater than the natural frequency of the droplet due to increased viscosity and results in an imaginary number, [Eq. (9)] which is in accordance with the over-damped mode of oscillation found.
After the initial transient has been damped out, momentum starts to grow again after a critical time corresponding to about t^{*} ≈ 50—and thus shorter than mentioned earlier—but now the two halves move precisely in phase but, once again, with no discernible pattern amongst the three cases, possibly because the two momenta are here reported as Cartesian components.
F. Topology of the wake
The geometrical characteristics of the droplet wake, namely, the width, length, and distance from the rear surface of the droplet [Fig. 17], were investigated. The characteristic lengths were normalised with the initial droplet diameter and their temporal evolution can be seen in Fig. 18. The temporal evolution of the characteristic lengths is plotted up to t^{*} = 50; after that time the lengths cannot be readily determined due to the highly asymmetric structure of the droplet wake. The effects of the increase in the liquid viscosity are marginal, flattening the wake and decreasing its length, with the vortex centres moving slightly farther apart. In comparison with the corresponding wake dimensions of a steady state flow around a solid sphere for the same Re number, the wake is considerably wider and longer. For specific comparison, at t^{*} = 50 of the least viscous case, which corresponds to an instantaneous Re number of 273, the dimensions of the wake of a solid sphere are approximately l^{*} = 0.4 d^{*} = 0.6 and s^{*} = 1.4 [37]. Although the aforementioned Re number is based on the initial droplet diameter, the dimensions of the wake are substantially larger even when considering a solid sphere with the diameter equal to that of the deformed diameter of the droplet and are within the range of values found by Dandy and Leal [38].
At the critical time of wake symmetry breakdown, the droplet velocity can be used to define a critical Re number and Fig. 19, based on the initial droplet diameter, presents the droplet critical Re number and the non-dimensional critical time as a function of the Oh number. It is seen that both critical Re_{crit} and time t_{crit} decrease with the Oh number; this is because with increasing Oh, not only does the viscosity increase but so does the viscosity ratio. It is this ratio which is the main measure of vorticity production across the interface of the droplet and which also contributes to the initiation of the breakdown of the symmetry of the wake of the droplet. According to Brøns et_al [40], vorticity could be generated due to a jump in the tangential pressure gradient or acceleration between two viscous fluids; this vorticity generation is proportional to the curvature of the interface, when slip conditions apply, and also to the viscosity ratio of the two fluids. In the presented cases, the most viscous droplet has greater deformation (higher curvature at its major equator, as a result the vorticity production is higher).
These values of the critical Re_{crit} number are substantially lower than those for the flow around a solid sphere [41,42]: a steady, asymmetric flow in the wake of a solid sphere appears for Re_{crit} = 272. For the present case, the Re_{crit} number ranges from 198 to 215 for the most and least viscous droplet, respectively. The difference could be due to the additional vorticity production mechanism [40], described earlier, which does not occur for the case of a solid sphere.
G. Symmetry break in the wake of the droplet
As described in Sec. III F, after critical Re_{crit}, the wake of droplet becomes asymmetric. The droplet begins to acquire velocity components in the horizontal plane, which means that differences in pressure (or variations in shear stress) and in velocity around the equator of the droplet start to be substantial. It could be that the asymmetric flow in the wake region is transferred inside the droplet and that is the reason why the droplet acquires a horizontal component of velocity.
The velocity components, ui*, in the x-, y-, z-directions at the centreline of the droplet in the horizontal direction, as shown in Fig. 10(d), were investigated and are presented in Fig. 20 along with the VoF coefficient α for the least viscous droplet. Velocities are normalised with the initial injection velocity u_{0} and the horizontal distance x^{*} with the initial droplet diameter d_{0}.
The velocity ux* in the x-direction is, as might be expected, anti-symmetric within the droplet as also in the external air flow around the droplet. The velocity in the gravitational direction, uy*, illustrates the relative velocity around the droplet along with the velocity of the Hill vortex inside the droplet. The velocity uy* is maximum at the centre of the droplet, where the Hill vortices interact with each other, and at the poles of the droplet, where the slip velocity at the interface interacts with the free stream. The velocity in the z-direction uz* is zero across the line connecting the droplet poles in the xy-plane [Fig. 10(d)], indicating that the flow within the droplet is symmetric up to time t^{*} = 40.
At t^{*} = 45, the symmetry in the wake of the droplet has broken so, for times around t^{*} = 50 [Fig. 20(d)], a non-zero z-direction component of the velocity appears in the external flow near the interface of the droplet, thereby transporting fluid out of the notional plane of symmetry of the flow and indicative therefore of asymmetry in the flow; the Hill vortex in the interior of the droplet starts to develop asymmetry. The time between the breakdown of the symmetrical flows in the wake and within the droplet increase with the liquid viscosity and that is due to the increased time the x- and z-momenta need to build up in the interior of the droplet. At longer times, say t^{*} = 100, the z-direction component keeps increasing in the interior of the droplet in the Hill vortex, as shown in Fig. 20(f), and the u_{x} component departs from the expected anti-symmetric profile.
H. Drag coefficient
For the range of initial Re numbers investigated, the drag force acting on the droplet increases and is associated with droplet distortion and consequent increase of the droplet frontal area. At the same time, the increased curvature at the main equator of the droplet leads to a decreased recovery distance as compared to that of a sphere which, as a result, gives a longer and wider wake, again as compared to a solid sphere.
The drag coefficient C_{d} of the droplet was calculated by normalising the drag force acting on the droplet with the velocity and the droplet frontal area at that time [Eq. (35)]. The normalised drag force Fd* or, in other words, the drag coefficient normalised with the initial conditions is shown in Eq. (36),
where m_{d} and a_{d} are the mass and acceleration of the droplet and A and A_{0} are the instantaneous and initial cross-sectional area of the droplet, respectively.
Figure 21 shows the values of the drag coefficient C_{d} for all three cases as a function of the instantaneous Re number. The increase in the droplet frontal area in combination with the increased curvature at the equator of the droplet, as compared to a solid sphere, result in a combined increase in the droplet drag coefficient of 20% for a given Re number. The drag, normalised with the initial conditions, as a function of the Re number is presented in Fig. 22 which shows that the normalised drag force Fd* increases with time (or, equivalently, instantaneous Re number), despite the decrease in the drag coefficient (which is, anyway, the case also for a solid sphere). However, there is an initial period (up to t^{*} = 13.5), greater than the corresponding value for the most viscous case (case 3) during which the drag force Fd* decreases.
Figure 23 compares the drag coefficients C_{d} for all cases with the corresponding values of the DDB, C_{d,DDB} [Eq. (16)], and TAB models, C_{d,TAB} [Eq. (14)]. The drag coefficient of case 3 is largest at the earlier stages of the release because the most viscous droplet achieves its maximum frontal area immediately upon release and does not oscillate [Fig. 23(c)], compared to the drag coefficient of case 1 that oscillates around C_{d} = 0.9 [Fig. 23(a)]. This oscillation is in agreement with the change in the droplet frontal area and could be possibly linked with vortex shedding in the wake side after t^{*} = 60.
In all cases, DDB and TAB models are unable to calculate the drag coefficient of the droplet at the initial times of release because these models use drag coefficient equations that refer to droplets in the steady state. But before the droplet approaches a steady state, the models are unable to capture the oscillation of the drag coefficient and generally its temporal behavior for all cases, illustrating that substantial phenomena have not been taken into consideration by these models.
The expressions for the drag coefficient presented in the introduction [Eqs. (10), (11), and (13)], are shown in Fig. 24 and compared with the temporal evolution of the drag coefficient found for case 1. It is seen that Eq. (11) is able to capture the trend of the temporal evolution of the drag coefficient which has been found; however, it over-predicts the value substantially, especially at the early stages of release. It seems that Eq. (10) is in good agreement regarding the final values at the end of the computations when the droplet is closer to a quasi steady state.
I. Internal liquid flow
The presence of the internal circulation of the droplet may affect the breakup process and should it be taken into consideration in a droplet breakup model, the substantial difference between the time scales that govern the internal and external flows should be recognised. Here, we examine the decrease in duration needed for the formation of the Hill vortex with reduction in viscosity from t^{*} = 12.2 to 8.2 for the range of Oh numbers examined and for a Re number constant at approximately 145. For this purpose, we show the temporal evolution of a characteristic velocity magnitude in the interior of the droplet and, specifically, the maximum velocity magnitude of the region where the two vortices interact inside the droplet, as shown in Fig. 25. The black solid lines are the projections of the streamlines—which exist in three dimensions—of the rollex and Hill vortex of the droplet, giving a pseudo-perspective view of the flow inside, and around, the droplet.
For the given duration in time, and for all cases, this characteristic velocity increases linearly with time, the gradient in Fig. 26 increasing with the decrease in the viscosity, illustrating that not only does the less viscous droplet have a higher internal kinetic energy but also that it increases faster with time. The rate of change in the velocity of case 1 is 2.5 times higher than of cases 2 and 5 times that in case 3. At t^{*} = 110, the maximum velocity in the interior of the droplet is found to be 3.5% and 0.5% of the initial injection velocity for the least (case 1) and most (case 3) viscous droplets, respectively. Another feature to notice is that, whilst the droplet shape has almost approached a quasi steady state up to time t^{*} = 100, at least regarding its shape, the internal flow, i.e., the Hill Vortex, is nevertheless still developing. The time scale associated with the internal circulation of the droplet is approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the external flow: over the examined time period, a fluid particle moving in the Hill vortex has completed only about 1.5 rotations within the droplet for the most viscous case and about 4 for the least viscous. The Hill vortex is thus almost totally decoupled from the likely time scales in a turbulent flow.
J. The roller-vortex (rollex)
For the range of instantaneous Re numbers examined in this study, the wake in the case of a solid sphere is attached to the rear surface of the sphere [37]. However, as explained previously, this might not be the case for a droplet due to the existence of its internal flow: an additional flow structure can be expected to arise which will act as an “idler gear” between the direction of circulation of the recirculation zone in the wake and that of the internal circulation of the droplet. The kinematic constraint generates a vortex, rolling at the interface between droplet and the gas, here called a rollex; the strength of the rollex and its position depend on the flow development and on liquid viscosity. The rollex was found to exist for the whole range of non-dimensional parameters (Oh, We, and Re) examined in this study. The rollex is a relatively small structure and in this work was covered by at least 6 computational cells in height and 15 in width. The size and position of the rollex were found to be almost the same for the two different meshes of the grid dependence study.
It is observed that the formation of the rollex takes place almost immediately upon the injection of the droplet and, at time t^{*} = 4, is in place [Fig. 27(a)], well before the Hill vortex achieves its quasi steady state in the interior of the droplet. Up until the time of breakdown of symmetry in the wake region, the width and height of the rollex remain constant [Figs. 27(b) and 27(c)]. However, from that point onwards, the dimension of the rollex varies owing to the asymmetric nature of the wake behind the droplet. It could be that, through that structure (rollex), the asymmetric pattern of the wake is transmitted to the internal circulation of the droplet [Figs. 27(d) and 27(e)]. The horizontal momenta of the left and right hemispheres are not equal, and as a result, the droplet moves horizontally as well as vertically. In Fig. 27(e), at time t^{*} = 60.9, the rollex is found attached to the interface and is located mostly outside the droplet in the gas phase. However, it has a circulatory motion in the opposite direction to that proposed by Dandy and Leal [38] in Fig. 8(b) with the wake being detached.
Finally, although attention has been paid to the discretisation and to the algorithm of the gas-liquid interface in order to achieve a solution for the structure of these vortices, nevertheless it should be underlined that the exact geometric location of the vortices varied slightly with the numerics, namely, the 2nd order spatial discretisation schemes, retaining however the general characteristics outlined earlier.
K. Discussion on droplet breakup models
Models of droplet breakup are useful precisely because these do not represent all the details of the phenomena involved; nevertheless, some additional information may be required to improve their performance. The drag coefficient of the droplet is by far larger than the values considered by the models and should be adjusted until reaching steady state values which in the present study appeared after about 50 air flow non-dimensional times (based on initial conditions of the droplet velocity and diameter). Additionally, as both the width and length of the droplet wake are larger than for the solid sphere (for the same instantaneous Re number), a drag reduction mechanism should be considered for the droplets finding themselves in such a wake. The symmetry break of the internal circulation and wake region is incorporated neither physically nor energy-wise (especially in the DDB model) possibly leading to inaccuracies in droplet trajectory. The internal kinetic energy of the droplet (due to the Hill vortex), as also the time required to be formed, should not be ignored as it depends on the droplet viscosity and absorbs a substantial amount of energy from the flow.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
We have used the VoF method and fine temporal and spatial discretisation calculation schemes for the investigation of the transient flow inside, and around, a deforming millimetre class droplet released in air with an initial velocity of u_{0} = 1 m/s and falling under the action of gravity. This permitted a parametric study based on three liquid viscosities with the Oh number ranging from 0.045 to 0.4 at a constant initial We of 0.14. The study has revealed the following behavior for the droplets.
(a) The flow in the wake becomes asymmetric after a critical time tcrit* = 45, 43, and 40 with increasing viscosities (equivalent to Re_{crit} = 215, 210, 198). This asymmetry is transferred to the interior of the droplet, creating an asymmetric Hill vortex; the momenta of the droplet’s hemispheres in the direction perpendicular to gravity become finite and, when the instantaneous droplet velocity corresponds to a Re = 220 and for all cases, the droplets acquire motion in the direction perpendicular to, as well aligned with, the direction of gravity. The time lag between the symmetry break and the translation of the droplet increases with increasing liquid viscosity, confirming that it takes longer for the asymmetric flow to develop inside the most viscous droplet.
(b) The effects of droplet viscosity on the oscillatory behavior and deformation of the droplet are that the more viscous the liquid, the weaker is its oscillation. The least viscous droplet deforms with an under-damped oscillation at its natural frequency (around 20 ms) while, for the most viscous case, the oscillation is over-damped. This is because the damping factor b_{n} is greater than the natural frequency of the droplet; however, the droplet assumes its distorted shape almost immediately upon release. The value of the oscillation frequency and the magnitude of the deformation were in accordance with the literature.
(c) The temporal evolution of the drag coefficient of the droplet was found to tend toward the steady state magnitude of the drag available in the literature. Comparison with the DDB and TAB breakup models showed good agreement although, in all three cases, the drag coefficient was under-predicted by existing breakup models especially at the initial times of the release of the droplet. As compared to a solid sphere, the increase in the droplet frontal area, in combination with the increased pole curvature of the droplet and the associated longer length of the wake, result in a combined increase in the droplet drag coefficient of 20%.
(d) The geometrical structure of the wake behind a deformable droplet is little affected by the magnitude of the droplet’s viscosity. The wake detaches from the lee of the droplet with the development of an intermediate vortex (rollex) between the droplet and the wake. Owing to that mechanism, the asymmetric flow of the wake is transmitted into the interior of the droplet leading to its translation in the direction perpendicular to the direction of gravity, in addition to that aligned with that direction.
