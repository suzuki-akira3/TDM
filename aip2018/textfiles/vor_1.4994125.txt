SL(3, C) structure of one-dimensional Schrödinger equation
We present a new formalism for describing solutions of the one-dimensional stationary Schrödinger equation in terms of the Lie group SL(3, C) and its Lie algebra. In this formalism, we obtain a universal expression for the Green function which can be used in any representation of SL(3, C) and also expressions for various quantities involving products of Green functions. Specifically, we introduce an infinite-dimensional representation of SL(3, C) that provides a natural description of multiple scattering of waves. Using this particular representation, we can derive formulas which are useful for the analysis of the Green function.
I. INTRODUCTION
We consider the one-dimensional stationary Schrödinger equation
where the potential V_{S}(x) is a real-valued function defined for −∞ < x < ∞ and k is a complex number, Im k ≥ 0. Shifting V_{S}(x) by a constant if necessary, we set the origin of the energy scale at the ground-state energy. It is well known [1–3] that the Schrödinger equation can be written as a first-order equation with two components,
It follows from (1.2) that
where f′ denotes the derivative of f. Thus, (1.2) includes two Schrödinger equations as a pair. We will use only the first equation of (1.3), so we identify V_{S}(x) as
Let ψ_{0}(x) be a function [4] satisfying (1.1) with k^{2} = 0. We can choose ψ_{0} such that ψ_{0}(x) > 0 for any x. The function f is obtained from ψ_{0} as f(x)=ψ0′(x)/ψ_{0}(x). [This can be checked by substituting into (1.4).]
For later convenience, we rewrite (1.2) as
Let the 2 × 2 matrix U(x, y) be defined as the solution of
with the initial condition U(y, y) = I, where I denotes the 2 × 2 unit matrix. The four elements of the matrix U(x, y) can be written in terms of two functions α and β as
By comparing (1.6) with (1.5), we can see that the functions ψ_{−} and ψ_{+} defined by
are two solutions of the Schrödinger equation (1.1). Any solution ψ(x) of the Schrödinger equation can be expressed as a linear combination of ψ_{+}(x, y) and ψ_{−}(x, y) with a fixed y.
Since the matrix in front of U on the right-hand side of (1.6) is traceless, the determinant of U(x, y) does not depend on x. From U(y, y) = I, it follows that det U(x, y) = 1. The matrix U is a 2 × 2 matrix with unit determinant, and so we can interpret it as belonging to the Lie group SL(2, C). Thus, the Schrödinger equation has an obvious SL(2, C) structure. The matrix in front of U in (1.6) can be viewed as an element of the Lie algebra sl(2, C), which consists of 2 × 2 traceless matrices. As a basis of sl(2, C), we can choose
These matrices satisfy the commutation relations
Using (1.9), the right-hand side of (1.6) can be written as (2ik J_{3} − 2f J_{1}) U. This SL(2, C) structure of the Schrödinger equation is well known, and it is used in connection with the factorization of the Schrödinger operator and the supersymmetric formulation of quantum mechanics [5,6].
Needless to say, the Schrödinger equation is one of the most extensively studied equations in physics, and there are many approaches to the analysis of its solutions. The aim of this paper is to propose a new formalism which enables us to study the one-dimensional Schrödinger equation from a totally different point of view. In this paper, we consider an extension of the SL(2, C) structure by embedding it in SL(3, C). This SL(3, C) formalism is useful for describing solutions of the Schrödinger equation and, in particular, the Green function. Within this framework, we can construct a general expression for the Green function which includes various already-known expressions as specific representations. For example, in the most commonly used construction of the Green function, it is expressed in terms of Jost solutions or other solutions satisfying the required boundary conditions. Another important description of the Green function is given by its expression as a superposition of multiply scattered waves. These two apparently different pictures of the Green function are, in fact, merely two different representations of our general expression. In this way, our formalism provides a more general viewpoint on the Schrödinger equation, with which the structure of its solutions can be more clearly understood than in previous approaches.
The SL(3, C) formalism is not only of theoretical interest. By making use of the SL(3, C) structure, we can obtain various formulas which are notably useful for the analysis in low- and high-energy regions. Analytic behavior of solutions of the Schrödinger equation has been studied over the years by numerous researchers both in the low-energy region [7–13] and in the high-energy region [14–18]. Compared to the conventional methods used in these studies, our formalism is especially suited for examining the Green function. Using the formulas derived in this paper, the low-energy and the high-energy behavior of the Green function can be investigated more systematically than by other methods. In the present paper, however, we confine ourselves to the formal aspect of the theory. Its application to the analysis of solutions will be discussed elsewhere.
Our formulation does not depend on the specific form of the potential, so V_{S}(x) in (1.1) and f(x) in (1.2) may be quite general. For simplicity, we assume that f(x) is a piecewise continuously differentiable function of x. [The function f(x) may have jump discontinuities, and so V_{S}(x) given by (1.4) may have delta-function singularities.] No further conditions of smoothness are required. As for the behavior at infinity, we assume that the limits f(∞) ≡ lim_{x→+∞}f(x) and f′(∞) ≡ lim_{x→+∞}f′(x) exist. These limits may be infinite. That is to say, f(∞) is finite, +∞, or −∞ [and similarly for f′(∞)]. From this assumption and (1.4), it follows that V_{S}(∞) is either finite or +∞. We make the same assumption for the behavior of f(x) as x → −∞. Namely, f(−∞) is finite, +∞, or −∞ [and similarly for f′(−∞)]. Accordingly, V_{S}(−∞) is either finite or +∞. We do not consider the cases where V_{S}(∞) = −∞ or V_{S}(−∞) = −∞. Our method can be applied to more general cases including, for example, asymptotically periodic potentials and potentials that diverge at finite x. However, to avoid complication, we do not discuss such cases in this paper.
II. TRANSMISSION AND REFLECTION COEFFICIENTS
It is obvious that the matrix U defined in Sec. I satisfies U(x, y)U(y, z) = U(x, z). Hence,
The condition U(x, x) = I means α(x, x; ±k) = 1 and β(x, x; ±k) = 0. The determinant of U is unity, so α and β satisfy
Since U(x, y)U(y, x) = U(x, x) = I, the matrix U(y, x) is the inverse matrix of U(x, y). Equating the elements of U(y, x) and [U(x, y)]^{−1} gives
Using (2.3), the functions ψ_{±} defined by (1.8) can also be written as
It can be seen from (1.6) and (1.7) that α(x, y; ±k) = e^{∓ik(x−y)} and β(x, y; ±k) = 0 if f is identically zero. Therefore, ψ_{±}(x, y) = e^{±ik(x−y)} if f = 0. Let x_{1} and x_{2} be fixed numbers, x_{2} ≥ x_{1}, and suppose that f(x) = 0 for x < x_{1} and x > x_{2}. Then,
From (2.1), (1.8), and (2.3), we can easily derive the relations
Let us define the transmission coefficient τ, the right reflection coefficient R_{r}, and the left reflection coefficient R_{l} for the interval [x_{1}, x_{2}] as
(We omit to write the dependence of τ, R_{r}, and R_{l} on k.) We can rewrite (2.6) as
We find from (2.8) and (2.5) that
Hence we can see that τ, R_{r}, and R_{l} are indeed the transmission and reflection coefficients for the interval [x_{1}, x_{2}], as illustrated in Fig. 1.
We define the transmission and reflection coefficients for an interval [x_{1}, x_{2}] by (2.7) for general f(x) which is not necessarily zero outside this interval. We define the truncated function
and consider the corresponding potential [see Eq. (1.4)] for the Schrödinger equation
Obviously, V¯{S}(x)=V_{S}(x) for x_{1} < x < x_{2}, and V¯{S}(x)=0 for x < x_{1} and x_{2} < x. In addition, V¯{S}(x) includes delta functions at x = x_{1} and x = x_{2} unless f(x) happens to vanish there. The quantities τ(x_{2}, x_{1}), R_{r}(x_{2}, x_{1}), and R_{l}(x_{2}, x_{1}) defined by (2.7) can be thought of as the transmission and reflection coefficients for the Schrödinger equation with the potential V¯{S}.
The transmission and reflection coefficients can be defined for any closed interval, and they are functions of the two endpoints of the interval. From U(x, x) = I, we have τ(x, x) = 1 and R_{r}(x, x) = R_{l}(x, x) = 0. We can also define [19] the reflection coefficients for semi-infinite intervals by R_{r}(x, −∞) ≡ lim_{z→−∞}R_{r}(x, z) and R_{l}(∞, x) ≡ lim_{z→∞}R_{l}(z, x).
III. ALGEBRAIC CONSTRUCTION OF SOLUTIONS
As already noted, the right-hand side of (1.6) can be written as (2ik J_{3} − 2f J_{1})U with (1.9). Let us consider a more general case. We assume that J_{1}, J_{2}, and J_{3} are some linear operators (or matrices) satisfying the commutation relations (1.10). They are not necessarily the 2 × 2 matrices of (1.9). For such J_{1} and J_{3}, we define the evolution operator U(x, y) as the solution of
with the initial condition
where 1 denotes the identity operator. Equation (3.1) is a generalization of (1.6), and U(x, y) is an operator that acts on some vector space. Here and hereafter, U(x, y) is not necessarily the 2 × 2 matrix of Secs. I and II. The following relations, which we used in Sec. II for 2 × 2 matrices, hold for the general case as well:
We define the raising and lowering operators J_{±} by
The sl(2, C) commutation relations (1.10) then read
The operator U satisfying (3.1) and (3.2) can be expressed using J_{±} and J_{3} as
where τ^{2J3}=exp[2(log⁡τ)J_{3}]. The proof of (3.6) is given in Appendix A.
Suppose that there exist operators Q_{+} and Q_{−} that satisfy the commutation relations
Examples of such operators will be shown later. We can also write (3.7) as
Note that the 2 × 2 matrices appearing on the right-hand sides of (3.8) are the matrices for J_{3} and J_{1} ± iJ_{2} given by (1.9). From (3.7), it follows that
where c is an arbitrary complex number. Using (3.9) successively with (3.6) yields
Multiplying Eqs. (3.10) by τ, and rearranging the terms, we obtain
The structure of Eqs. (3.11) is illustrated in Fig. 2. Comparing Fig. 2 with Fig. 1, we find that Eqs. (3.11) can be viewed as a mathematical representation of the scattering events shown in Fig. 1. In each equation of (3.11), the left-hand side describes the incident wave, while the right-hand side describes the transmitted and reflected waves. The operators Q_{+} and Q_{−} correspond to the right-going wave e^{ikx} and the left-going wave e^{−ikx}, respectively. Substituting (2.7), we can rewrite (3.11) in another form,
Interchanging Q_{+} and Q_{−}, and changing the sign of k in α and β, we obtain
Equations (3.13) can also be derived from (3.12) by direct calculation using (2.2).
From (3.1) and (∂/∂x)[U(z, x)U(x, y)] = (∂/∂x)U(z, y) = 0, it follows that
Let A be an arbitrary operator. From (3.1) and (3.14) we have
where z and z′ are arbitrary real numbers. Setting A = Q_{±}, and using (3.8), we obtain
This equation has the same form as (1.5). We can also rewrite (3.16) in the form of (1.2),
It is our assumption that U and Q_{±} are operators (or matrices) acting on some vector space. We assume that this vector space is equipped with an inner product. Let ⟨Ψ_{2}, Ψ_{1}⟩ denote the inner product of two vectors Ψ_{1} and Ψ_{2}. This inner product is defined to be linear in the right entry and conjugate linear in the left entry. The adjoint of an operator A, denoted by A^{†}, is defined by ⟨Ψ_{2}, AΨ_{1}⟩ = ⟨A^{†}Ψ_{2}, Ψ_{1}⟩.
Let Ψ and Φ be some fixed vectors in this vector space. We define
As can be seen from (3.17), this ψ satisfies the same equation as the ψ in (1.2). Therefore, this ψ(x; z, z′), as a function of x, is a solution of the Schrödinger equation (1.1). It can be expressed as a linear combination of the functions ψ_{±} defined by (1.8). Using (3.12b) and (3.13b) in (3.18), and also using (2.4) and U(z, x)U(x, z′) = U(z, z′), we have
Similarly, using (3.12a), (3.13a), and (1.8) gives
The vectors Ψ and Φ determine the boundary conditions at x = z′ and x = z, respectively. For example, ψ(z′; z, z′) = 0 if (Q_{+} + Q_{−})Ψ = 0, and ψ(z; z, z′) = 0 if (Q++Q−){†}Φ=0. In this way, boundary conditions can be translated into conditions on Ψ and Φ.
We can impose boundary conditions at infinity by letting z → +∞ or z′ → −∞. Before thinking about the conditions on Ψ and Φ, we need to study the behavior of ψ_{±} in these limits. Let us first assume that f(x) tends to zero sufficiently rapidly as x → ±∞. Then, the functions ψ_{±}(x, z) behave like e^{±ik(x−z)} when both x and z are large. Similarly, ψ_{±}(x, z′) behave like e^{±ik(x−z′)} when both −x and −z′ are large. [Recall that ψ_{±}(x, y) = e^{±k(x−y)} if f is identically zero.] If we define
then χ_{+} and χ_{−} are the solutions of the Schrödinger equation such that
The limit z → +∞ of ψ_{+}(x, z) does not exist as a finite number. In order to obtain a definite function of x in this limit, it is necessary to multiply ψ_{+}(x, z) by the z-dependent normalization factor e^{ikz} before letting z → +∞, as in (3.21). Let x_{0} be a fixed number. It can be shown [20] that τ(z, x_{0}) ∼ C_{1}e^{ikz} as z → +∞, where C_{1} is a z-independent factor. [Similarly, τ(x_{0}, z′) ∼ C_{2}e^{−ikz′} as z′ → −∞.] Therefore, we can use τ(z, x_{0}) as the normalization factor for ψ_{+}(x, z) in place of e^{ikz}. That is, instead of (3.21) we may define
The fixed number x_{0} in (3.23) is arbitrary. By changing the choice of x_{0}, the form of ϕ_{±} changes only by a constant factor. It is obvious that ϕ_{±} satisfy the boundary conditions
where C_{1} and C_{2} are constants that depend on the choice of x_{0}.
Now let us consider the general case where f(x) does not necessarily vanish as x → ±∞. Whereas (3.21) is meaningful only when f(±∞) = 0, definition (3.23) is valid even if f(±∞) ≠ 0. It is shown in Appendix B that the limits on the right-hand sides of (3.23) exist as functions of x, and that these functions satisfy the boundary conditions
For real k, we may regard ϕ_{±} as ϕ_{±}(x; k) = lim_{ϵ↓0}ϕ_{±}(x; k + iϵ). As a solution of the Schrödinger equation, ϕ_{+}(x; k) is uniquely determined (apart from a constant factor) by the condition ϕ_{+}(+∞; k + iϵ) = 0 with ϵ > 0. Similarly, ϕ_{−}(x; k) is determined by the condition ϕ_{−}(−∞; k + iϵ) = 0. Thus, (3.25) is sufficient for specifying the boundary conditions even for Im k = 0. In the case f(±∞) = 0 discussed above, (3.25) is equivalent to (3.24). If |f(±∞)| = ∞, it follows from (3.25) that ϕ_{±}(±∞) = 0 for Im k = 0 as well.
It can be seen from (3.19) that ψ(x; z, z′) ∝ ψ_{+}(x, z) if Q+†Φ=0, and from (3.20) that ψ(x; z, z′) ∝ ψ_{−}(x, z′) if Q_{−}Ψ = 0. We find
where N_{1} = τ(z, x_{0})/⟨Φ, Q_{−}U(z, z′)Ψ⟩, N_{2} = τ(z_{0}, z′)/⟨Φ, U(z, z′)Q_{+}Ψ⟩. In this way, the solutions of the Schrödinger equation satisfying the boundary conditions (3.25) can be obtained from ψ(x; z, z′) by imposing the condition Q+†Φ=0 or Q_{−}Ψ = 0, and then taking the limit z → +∞ or z′ → −∞ with an appropriate normalization factor depending on z and z′. [The conditions Q+†Φ=0 and Q_{−}Ψ = 0 in (3.26) are sufficient conditions. In many cases, (3.26a) and (3.26b) hold under less stringent conditions on Ψ and Φ. See Appendix D.]
IV. GREEN FUNCTION
We define the Green function G(x, y; k) of the Schrödinger equation as the function satisfying
with the boundary conditions G(x, y; k) → 0 as |x − y| → ∞ for Im k > 0. The Green function for real k is defined by G(x, y; k) ≡ lim_{ϵ↓0}G(x, y; k + iϵ).
Let Ψ_{0} and Φ_{0} be vectors satisfying Q_{−}Ψ_{0} = 0 and Q+†Φ_{0}=0, let Ψ and Φ be arbitrary vectors, and let a and a′ be fixed numbers. Equations (3.26) mean that
where A_{1}(z) and A_{2}(z′) are some functions which also depend on the choice of Ψ, Φ, a, and a′. Let x ≥ y, and consider
This g_{0} has the form of (4.2a) as a function of x and (4.2b) as a function of y. Therefore,
where N(z, z′) is some appropriate factor, and C is a finite constant. This N(z, z′) is to be determined later. With such a factor N(z, z′), we define
The Green function G(x, y; k) (hereafter we will omit the argument k) is then obtained as
which reads, with (4.4) and (4.5), as
This G(x, y) indeed satisfies (4.1) for x ≠ y and also satisfies the required boundary conditions at infinity [see (3.25)]. It only remains to determine the factor N(z, z′) so that the delta function on the right-hand side of (4.1) may be correctly produced. This requires that
Using (3.17), the partial derivative of g(x, y; z, z′) can be calculated as
where fg stands for f(x)g(x, y; z, z′). Hence,
It can be shown from (3.12), (3.13), and (2.2) that
Also using Q_{−}Ψ_{0}=Q+†Φ_{0}=0 and U(z, y)U(y, z′) = U(z, z′), we find
As can be seen from (4.10) and (4.12), condition (4.8) is satisfied if we choose N(z, z′) as
The denominator of (4.13) vanishes if Q_{+}Ψ_{0} = 0 or Q−†Φ_{0}=0 [see (4.12)], so it is necessary that Q_{+}Ψ_{0} ≠ 0 and Q−†Φ_{0}≠0. From (4.6), (4.5), (4.3), and (4.13), we obtain the result
where Ψ_{0} and Φ_{0} are vectors such that
In the expressions on the right-hand side of (4.14), the denominator and the numerator do not exist separately. The upper expression, for example, should be understood as shorthand for
For later use, let us slightly generalize (4.14). Suppose that there are two, not only one, pairs of operators Q_{±}. That is to say, suppose that there are two pairs of operators, Q±a and Q±b, each satisfying the commutation relations (3.7) in place of Q_{±}. We assume that the vectors Ψ_{0} and Φ_{0} satisfy Q−aΨ_{0}=0 and (Q+b){†}Φ_{0}=0. Then, we can replace (4.3) with
Equations (4.4)–(4.7) remain valid with this replacement. Equations (4.10)–(4.13) hold with Q_{−}Q_{+} and Q_{+}Q_{−} replaced by Q−bQ+a and Q+bQ−a, respectively. Thus, the Green function can be written as
and similarly for y ≥ x. The conditions on Ψ_{0} and Φ_{0} are
Expression (4.14) can be thought of as a special case of (4.18), with Q±b=Q±a.
V. Q_{+} AND Q_{−} AS ELEMENTS OF sl(3, C)
To incorporate Q_{±} in addition to J_{±} and J_{3}, we need to deal with a larger algebra which contains sl(2, C) as a subalgebra. One such algebra is the Lie algebra sl(3, C). [Another possibility is the orthosymplectic Lie superalgebra osp(1/2). See Appendix E.] The Lie algebra sl(3, C) is defined by the commutation relations
The consistency of (5.1) requires [21] that J_{3} + K_{3} + L_{3} = 0. The sl(3, C) Lie algebra is spanned by eight independent elements J_{+}, J_{−}, J_{3}, K_{+}, K_{−}, K_{3}, L_{+}, and L_{−} satisfying (5.1). The sl(2, C) Lie algebra spanned by J_{+}, J_{−}, and J_{3} is contained in sl(3, C) as a subalgebra.
We can see that the commutation relations of (3.7) are included in (5.1) if we identify
Unfortunately, we cannot use expression (4.14) with (5.2). Since [Q_{+}, Q_{−}] = 0 for either choice of (5.2), the denominator on the right-hand side of (4.13) becomes zero and so (4.14) does not make sense. This difficulty can be circumvented by adopting
where c_{1} and c_{2} are arbitrary nonzero numbers. However, since there are two possible choices for Q_{±}, it is more natural to use (4.18) rather than (4.14). We identify Q±a and Q±b as
Expression (4.18) then becomes
where
[Here and hereafter, we consider G(x, y) only for x ≥ y. The expressions for x < y can be obtained by interchanging x and y.] Although we do not discuss it here, it can be shown that expression (4.14) with (5.3) essentially reduces to (5.5) as well.
We are regarding J_{±}, J_{3}, K_{±}, K_{3}, L_{±}, and L_{3} as linear operators (or matrices) acting on some vector space. This means that we are actually dealing with a representation of the Lie algebra sl(3, C). Choosing an explicit form for these operators is equivalent to choosing a particular representation of sl(3, C). When a particular representation of the Lie algebra is chosen, the evolution operator U defined by (3.1) belongs to the corresponding representation of the Lie group SL(3, C). Equation (5.5) is a representation-independent expression of the Green function. By writing (5.5) in specific representations, we obtain diverse expressions for the Green function. We will see examples in Secs. VI and VII.
VI. FUNDAMENTAL REPRESENTATION
The fundamental representation of the Lie algebra sl(3, C) consists of 3 × 3 traceless matrices. We can choose the 3 × 3 traceless matrices satisfying (5.1) as
The representation space, i.e., the vector space on which these matrices act, is the space of three-dimensional vectors with complex components. The inner product in this space is
With this inner product, the adjoint is the conjugate transpose of the matrix, so K−†=K_{+} and L+†=L_{−}. The vectors satisfying (5.6) can be chosen as
Since the upper-left 2 × 2 parts of J_{3} and J_{1} = (J_{+} + J_{−})/2 coincide with the 2 × 2 matrices of (1.9), it is obvious that U defined by (3.1) is a matrix of the form
where α and β are the same functions as in (1.7). This U is a 3 × 3 matrix with unit determinant and so belongs to the fundamental representation of the SL(3, C) Lie group. Substituting (6.4), (6.1), and (6.3) in (5.5) yields
As noted before, the denominator and the numerator on the right-hand side of (6.5) do not exist separately. The numerator is ψ_{+}(x, ∞)ψ_{−}(y, −∞) [see (2.4) and (1.8)], which is meaningless by itself. We need to normalize ψ_{±} as in Eq. (3.23), which can be written as
From (6.6), (1.6), and (2.3), we have
Hence we can calculate the Wronskian W(ϕ_{+}, ϕ_{−}) ≡ ϕ_{+}(dϕ_{−}/dx) − (dϕ_{+}/dx)ϕ_{−} as
where we have used (2.1). From (6.5), (6.6) and (6.8), we retrieve the well-known expression
VII. INFINITE-DIMENSIONAL REPRESENTATION
It can be readily seen that the following differential operators, which act on functions of two variables ξ and μ, satisfy the sl(2, C) commutation relations (3.5):
This representation of sl(2, C) was thoroughly studied in Ref [22], where it was used for the analysis of reflection coefficients. [The meaning of (7.1) will be explained in Sec. X.]
We can extend (7.1) to sl(3, C) in the following way. Interchanging ξ and η in (7.1) and changing the overall sign, we define L_{−}, L_{+}, and L_{3} as
It is obvious that L_{±} and L_{3} defined by (7.2) also satisfy the sl(2, C) commutation relations. From (7.1) and (7.2), we define K_{+} ≡ [J_{−}, L_{−}] = μ∂/∂ξ, K_{−} ≡ [L_{+}, J_{+}] = ξ∂/∂μ, and K_{3}≡−J_{3}−L_{3}=12μ(∂/∂μ)−12ξ(∂/∂ξ). In sum, we have
It can be checked that all commutation relations of (5.1) are satisfied with (7.3). Thus, (7.3) gives a representation of sl(3, C). The meaning of these operators, as well as the meaning of the variables μ and ξ, will be discussed in Sec. X.
The representation space, on which these operators act, is a vector space consisting of functions of two complex variables ξ and μ. We assume that these functions are analytic in |ξ| < 1 and |μ| < 1. The basis of the representation space is given by
We define the inner product of the basis vectors as
where δ_{mn} is the Kronecker delta. [For p = q = 0, we interpret (7.5) to mean ⟨Ψ_{0,0}, Ψ_{0,0}⟩ = 0. This inner product is not positive definite.] Then it can be shown (see Appendix F) that
The vectors satisfying (5.6) can be chosen as
where q is arbitrary as long as q ≠ 0. The inner product of two arbitrary functions Ψ(ξ, μ) and Φ(ξ, μ) is determined from (7.5) by the linearity of the inner product in the right entry and the conjugate linearity in the left entry. We have (see Appendix F)
where ξ = ξ_{1} + iξ_{2} and μ = μ_{1} + iμ_{2}. The integrals in (7.8) are area integrals over the unit disk |ξ| < 1 in the complex ξ-plane and |μ| < 1 in the μ-plane.
It was shown in Ref [22] that the evolution operator U, which is given by (3.6) with (7.1), acts on an arbitrary function Ψ(ξ, μ) as
where L^ and T^ are defined by
Although Eq. (7.9) was derived in Ref [22] for SL(2, C), it can also be used for SL(3, C) without need of any modification. We can think of this U as an operator belonging to the infinite-dimensional representation of the Lie group SL(3, C) corresponding to (7.3).
Let us consider (5.5) in this representation. We use the abbreviation
and similarly for τ, R_{r}, R_{l}, and L^. With (7.7), expression (5.5) reads
where q is an arbitrary positive integer (the result will not depend on q). Now we calculate the numerator on the right-hand side of (7.12) using (7.9). First, (7.9) and (7.10) give
Next, we apply L_{−} + K_{+} to (7.13). Here we use the formula
which holds for any positive integer m and any complex number c. This formula can be checked by direct calculation with L_{−} + K_{+} = μ^{2}(∂/∂μ) + μ(1 + ξ)(∂/∂ξ). Hence,
Using (7.9), (7.10), and L_{+} − K_{−} = −(1 + ξ)(∂/∂μ), we can proceed as follows:
The right-hand side of (7.18) has the form of Φ(ξ,μ)=[T^(ξ,μ)]{q}A(L^(ξ))=μ^{q}B(ξ), where A is a function of L^ and B is a function of ξ. We find from (7.5) that
Since T^(ξ=0,μ)=μτ and L^(ξ=0)=R_{l}, we have qB(0) = qτ^{q}A(R_{l}). Therefore, the inner product of (7.18) with Ψ_{0,q} is obtained by replacing T^ and L^ with τ and R_{l}, respectively, and then multiplying by q. This yields
where we have used
the proof of which is given in Appendix G.
In the meantime, the denominator on the right-hand side of (7.12) can be easily calculated using (7.9) and (7.19) as
Substituting (7.20) and (7.23) into (7.12), we obtain
Unlike (6.5), both the denominator and the numerator of (7.24) exist as finite quantities.
Thus, in this representation, Eq. (5.5) gives an expression of the Green function in terms of transmission and reflection coefficients. Solutions of the Schrödinger equation can be interpreted as waves undergoing the process of multiple reflections and transmissions. The infinite-dimensional representation given by (7.3) provides a natural basis for understanding the Schrödinger equation from this viewpoint, as we will see in Sec. X.
VIII. MORE GENERAL FORMULAS
As shown in (5.2), the Lie algebra sl(3, C) includes two different pairs of Q_{±} satisfying (3.7). All equations derived in Sec. III hold for both choices of (5.2). Equations (3.11) read
Let Ψ_{0} and Φ_{0} be vectors satisfying K_{+}Ψ_{0} = 0 and K−†Φ_{0}=0. The two equations of (8.1a) give UL_{−}Ψ_{0} = τL_{−}UΨ_{0} and K_{+}UΨ_{0} = R_{r}L_{−}UΨ_{0}, and hence (L_{−} + K_{+})UΨ_{0} = (1/τ)(1 + R_{r})UL_{−}Ψ_{0}. Repeating this n times, and also using [K_{+}, L_{−}] = 0, we have
In the same way, by using (8.1b) and [K_{−}, L_{+}] = 0, we can derive
The second equation of (8.1b) also gives
From (8.2)–(8.4), we have
For this expression to be nonzero, it is necessary that L−nΨ_{0}≠0 and (L+†){n}Φ_{0}≠0. Setting n = 1 in (8.5), and comparing it with (5.5), we find
[This is the same equation as (6.5).] From (8.5) and (8.6), we obtain
for any positive integer n. The vectors Ψ_{0} and Φ_{0} in (8.7) are required to satisfy
In the fundamental representation studied in Sec. VI, vectors satisfying (8.8) with (6.1) do not exist for n ≥ 2. In the representation introduced in Sec. VII, on the other hand, the vector Ψ_{0,q} [defined by (7.4)] satisfies (8.8) with (7.3) for any n if q ≠ 0. Let us check Eq. (8.7) in this representation. The n-times repetition of (7.14) gives
From (7.13) and (8.9) we have, with the notation of (7.11),
Proceeding in the same way as in Eqs. (7.16)–(7.20), we arrive at
As a generalization of (7.23), we can easily derive
Hence,
This becomes (8.7) by letting z → ∞ and z′ → −∞ [see (7.24)].
Expression (8.7) can be generalized to the product of Green functions with different arguments. For instance, the product of two Green functions and the product of three Green functions can be expressed as
[Equations (8.14) are to be understood together with (8.15), as in (4.16). The quantities N_{2} and N_{3} do not have a meaning by themselves.] The vectors Ψ_{0} and Φ_{0} are required to satisfy (8.8) with n = 2 for (8.14a) and n = 3 for (8.14b). We can easily prove (8.14) in the same way as (8.7), by using repeatedly (8.2) and (8.3) with n = 1 and also using [K_{+}, L_{−}] = [K_{−}, L_{+}] = 0. In (8.14), we are assuming (without loss of generality) that x_{i} ≥ y_{i} for each i. The order between x_{i} and y_{j} with i ≠ j is arbitrary. [For example, (8.14a) is valid for either x_{1} ≥ y_{2} or y_{2} > x_{1}. Recall that U(x_{1}, y_{2}) with y_{2} > x_{1} is the inverse of U(y_{2}, x_{1}).] The product of four or more Green functions can be expressed in the same way. Products of Green functions frequently appear in perturbation expansions. Expressions like (8.14) can be useful for the perturbative treatment of the Schrödinger equation.
We can also extend (8.7) to negative powers of G. Let us assume that the operators L_{−} + K_{+}, L_{+} − K_{−}, and L_{±} have inverses denoted by (L−+K+){−1}, (L+−K−){−1}, and L±−1. (Although the matrices for L_{−} + K_{+}, L_{+} − K_{−}, and L_{±} in finite-dimensional representations are not invertible, it is possible to define the inverses of these operators in infinite-dimensional representations, as shown below.) We define A^{−n}≡(A−1){n} for any operator A. Then,
where Ψ_{0} and Φ_{0} are nonzero vectors such that L−−nΨ_{0} and (L+−n){†}Φ_{0} exist. As always, we also assume K_{+}Ψ_{0} = 0 and K−†Φ_{0}=0. The proof of (8.16) is given in Appendix H.
Let us check the validity of (8.16) in the representation given by (7.3). We are assuming that the operators defined by (7.3) act on functions Ψ(ξ, μ) which are analytic in |ξ| < 1 and |μ| < 1. We further restrict the domains of L_{−} + K_{+}, L_{+} − K_{−}, and L_{±} to functions Ψ(ξ, μ) satisfying Ψ(ξ, 0) = 0. Then, obviously, the inverses of L_{+} = −∂/∂μ and L_{+} − K_{−} = −(1 + ξ)∂/∂μ are
The inverses of L_{−} and L_{−} + K_{+} are more complicated. We consider their action on functions of the form μ^{m}g(ξ) instead of general Φ(ξ, μ). It can be shown (see Appendix I) that
where m > 1. We can choose Ψ_{0} and Φ_{0} in (8.16) as Ψ_{0} = Φ_{0} = Ψ_{0,q} [Eq. (7.4)] with arbitrary q > n. To calculate the numerator on the right-hand side of (8.16), we start with
As shown in Appendix I, the inverse operator (L−+K+){−1} given by (8.18b) satisfies
for any positive integer n smaller than m. Therefore, (8.19) becomes
which has the form of (8.10) with n replaced by −n. The rest of the calculation is the same as that for (8.10), and we find that (8.11) holds with the replacement n → −n. From (8.18a) and the first equation of (8.17), it follows that
Using (8.22) and (7.19), we can see that (8.12) remains valid with n replaced by −n. Therefore, (8.13) also holds with n replaced by −n, which verifies (8.16).
Although (8.7), (8.14), and (8.16) are representation-independent expressions, the vectors Ψ_{0} and Φ_{0} satisfying the required conditions may not necessarily exist in a finite-dimensional representation. These general formulas can be fully utilized only in infinite-dimensional representations like the one in Sec. VII.
IX. SIMPLIFIED EXPRESSIONS WITH q = 0
Each of the expressions in (5.5), (8.7), and (8.14) contains a denominator of the form ⟨Φ_{0},U(∞,−∞)L+nL−nΨ_{0}⟩ with some n. This denominator does not have a meaning by itself. As in (4.16), we need to let z′ → −∞ and z → +∞ after dividing the numerator by the denominator. It is much convenient if we can get rid of such a denominator. This can be achieved by using the representation introduced in Sec. VII.
In this section, we solely work with the infinite-dimensional representation given by (7.3). The expressions derived here are not representation independent.
In (7.12), the denominator on the right-hand side has the form of (7.23), which is proportional to [τ(z,z′)]^{q}. This denominator would become a harmless constant if we could choose q = 0. We cannot directly set q = 0, however, since L_{−}Ψ_{0,q} = 0 for q = 0 [and, accordingly, (7.23) has a factor which vanishes for q = 0]. We have to consider a limit in which q approaches zero. Since the index q in (7.4) was defined as an integer, it is necessary to extend q to real numbers in order to take the limit q → 0. Instead of (7.4), we may consider the representation space spanned by
where α is a fixed real number, 0 < α < 1. [We need to take both positive and negative integers for q − α in order to make the space closed under the operation of (7.3).] The inner product in this space can be defined by rewriting (7.5) in terms of the gamma function as
Relations (7.6) still hold (see Appendix F) with this inner product. The vectors satisfying conditions (5.6) can be chosen as Ψ_{0} = Φ_{0} = Ψ_{0,q} with any q such that q − α is an integer. Since we are going to take the limit q → 0, we shall use q = α.
Equations (7.23) and (7.15) are valid even if q is not an integer. With q = α, they read
In Eq. (7.12), we set q = α, substitute (9.3) into the denominator, and then take the limit α → 0 before z′ → −∞ and z → +∞. This yields
Since (L+−K−){†}=−(L_{−}+K_{+}) [see (7.6)], we can write the right-hand side of (9.5) as
where the adjoint of the evolution operator U is [see (3.6) and (7.6)]
We define
The right-hand side of (9.8a) is obtained from (9.4). By comparing (9.7) with (3.6), we find that Λ_{l}(x) is obtained from Λ_{r}(y) by replacing R_{r}(y, −∞) with Rl*(∞,x). Thus,
We can express Eq. (9.9) in terms of the basis vectors defined by (7.4) as
From (9.5), (9.6), and (9.8), we obtain the simple expression
In the same way, from (8.7) we can derive
It can be seen from (7.14) that both Λ_{r} and Λ_{l} have the remarkable property
Using (9.13), we can also write (9.12) as
where Λln(x)≡[Λl(x)]{n}, Λrn(y)≡[Λr(y)]{n}. Similarly, expressions (8.14) can be written as
As a simple example of calculation, let us consider G(x, y) for y = x. Substituting (9.10) into (9.11) with y = x, and using ⟨Ψ_{p′,1}, Ψ_{p,1}⟩ = δ_{pp′}, we have
This agrees with (7.24) for the case y = x [where τ(x, x) = 1 and R_{r}(x, x) = R_{l}(x, x) = 0].
It is also possible to write (9.11), (9.14), and (9.15) using only Λ_{r}, without Λ_{l}. Obviously, U(L_{+} − K_{−})U(L_{−} + K_{+})UΨ_{0,α} can be expressed as a linear combination of Ψ_{p,α} with various p. (Note that L_{−} + K_{+} raises and L_{+} − K_{−} lowers the power of μ by one, whereas U neither raises nor lowers it.) Since ⟨Ψ_{0,α}, Ψ_{0,α}⟩ = α, we can see that ⟨Ψ_{0,α},Φ⟩=αc_{0}=αμ^{−α}Φ{ξ=0} if Φ=∑p=0∞c_{p}Ψ_{p,α}. Thus,
Substituting (9.17) into (9.5), we obtain
where U(∞, x)…|_{ξ=0} is shorthand for lim_{z→∞}{U(z, x)…|_{ξ=0}}. Similarly, corresponding to (9.14) and (9.15), we have
Such asymmetric expressions are often more convenient in practice than the symmetric expressions that use both Λ_{r} and Λ_{l}.
X. MULTIPLE SCATTERING AND THE INFINITE-DIMENSIONAL REPRESENTATION OF SL(3, C)
The Green function G(x, y) can be interpreted as a superposition of waves propagating from point y to point x undergoing multiple scattering by the potential. In this section, let us explain how the infinite-dimensional representation of SL(3, C) introduced in Sec. VII gives a natural description of multiple scattering processes.
The multiple-scattering picture becomes simpler when scattering is expressed in terms of the function f rather than V_{S}. As shown in Appendix J, the Green function multiplied by 2ik can be written as a formal series in f,
[The terms of general order in this series are shown in (J5) and (J6) of Appendix J.] The first term on the right-hand side, e^{ik(x−y)}, describes a wave propagating rightwards [23] from y to x. The second and third terms can be interpreted as describing a wave that propagates from y to z_{1}, gets scattered at z_{1}, and then propagates to x. In the second term, the factor e^{−ik(z1−y)} should be understood as a wave propagating leftwards from y to z_{1}. The wave changes direction at z_{1} and then goes rightwards to x, as can be seen from the factor e^{ik(x−z1)}. In this manner, each term in (10.1) represents a multiple-scattering event. Each single scattering at position z gives a factor +f(z) if the wave comes to z from the right (as in the second term) and −f(z) if it comes from the left (as in the third term). It should be noted that the wave always changes direction when scattered. There is no “forward scattering” if scattering is described in terms of f. (This is an advantage of using f instead of V_{S}.) The first five terms in (10.1) can thus be expressed graphically as in Fig. 3. The connection between (10.1) and Fig. 3 is given by the rules summarized in Fig. 4.
A higher-order term in (10.1) can be expressed graphically as in Fig. 5, corresponding to a process in which a wave starting from y is successively scattered at z_{1}, z_{2}, z_{3}, … before arriving at x. Figure 5 can be regarded as a diagram representing a path in one-dimensional space. The diagram has a value given by the rules of Fig. 4, and (10.1) means that 2ikG(x, y) is the sum of all such diagrams. (Integrations over z_{1}, z_{2}, z_{3,} … are implied in the sum.) The sum of diagrams can also be thought of as the sum over all paths connecting y and x. (We use the word “path” to mean something like Fig. 5, which corresponds to each term in the multiple-scattering series. It is not a path in the sense of Feynman path integral.)
Let x_{1} < x_{2}, and suppose that f(x) = 0 for x ≤ x_{1} and x ≥ x_{2}. Setting x = x_{2}, y = x_{1} in (7.24) and substituting R_{r}(x_{1}, −∞) = R_{l}(∞, x_{2}) = 0 yields 2ikG(x_{2}, x_{1}) = τ(x_{2}, x_{1}). In other words, the transmission coefficient τ(x_{2}, x_{1}) is equal to 2ikG(x_{2}, x_{1}) assuming that scattering occurs only within the interval (x_{1}, x_{2}). Since ikG(x_{2}, x_{1}) is the sum over all paths connecting x_{1} and x_{2}, we can see that τ(x_{2}, x_{1}) is the sum over all paths that start from x_{1} and end at x_{2} without leaving the interval (x_{1}, x_{2}) [Fig. 6(a)]. Similarly, setting x = y = x_{2} in (7.24) and using R_{r}(x_{2}, −∞) = R_{r}(x_{2}, x_{1}) with R_{l}(∞, x_{2}) = 0 and τ(x_{2}, x_{2}) = 1, we find that 2ikG(x_{2}, x_{2}) = 1 + R_{r}(x_{2}, x_{1}) if scattering occurs only within the interval (x_{1}, x_{2}). Therefore, the right reflection coefficient R_{r}(x_{2}, x_{1}) is the sum over all paths that start from and return to x_{2} without leaving the interval (x_{1}, x_{2}) [Fig. 6(b)]. In the same way, the left-reflection coefficient R_{l}(x_{2}, x_{1}) is the sum over all paths starting from and returning to x_{1}, confined within the interval (x_{1}, x_{2}) [Fig. 6(c)].
Now let us see how the formalism presented in Sec. VII works as a method for taking the sum over such paths. Figure 7(a) shows a diagram representing a path that runs through the interval (z′, z). The sum of all such diagrams is the transmission coefficient τ(z, z′) [see Fig. 6(a)]. Let us take an arbitrary point x between z′ and z. We truncate this diagram at x, retaining only the part to the left of x. Each fragment of the path to the right of x [rectangular boxes in Fig. 7(b)] is contracted to a black circle if it starts from x and returns to x. It is contracted to a white circle if it connects the two points x and z. In this way, we obtain a reduced diagram with white and black circles as in Fig. 7(c). We assign a ξ to a black circle and a μ to a white circle. Then, such a diagram takes a value in the vector space spanned by the vectors Ψ_{p,q} of (7.4). For instance, the value of the diagram in Fig. 7(c) is CΨ_{1,2} = Cμξ^{2}, where the scalar factor C is the value of the path in the interval (z′, x) calculated according to the rules of Fig. 4.
The general equation satisfied by the evolution operator U is Eq. (3.1). In the square brackets on the right-hand side of this equation, the first term 2ik J_{3} describes free evolution and the second term −2f J_{1} describes scattering. In the representation given by (7.3), the scattering term reads −2f J_{1} = −f(∂/∂ξ) + fξ^{2}(∂/∂ξ) + fξμ(∂/∂μ). Hence, scattering is described by the three operators −f(∂/∂ξ), fξ^{2}(∂/∂ξ), and fξμ(∂/∂μ). The graphical meaning of these differential operators is shown in Fig. 8. Paths with turning points are created by the action of these three operators. For example, the path in Fig. 9(a) is generated as shown in Fig. 9(b). Meanwhile, the operator 2J_{3} = 2ξ(∂/∂ξ) + μ(∂/∂μ) counts the number of lines at each cross section of the diagram. In the example of Fig. 9(a), the operator 2J_{3} gives the value m = 1, 3, 5, 3, and 1 at x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, x_{4}, and x_{5}, respectively. Therefore, the free evolution term 2ik J_{3} gives rise to the factor exp[mik(b − a)] between two points a and b where there are m lines. This is the value of the line segments given by the rule of Fig. 4(a).
The operator U describes the evolution of the path from left to right. As in Fig. 9(b), the evolution of a single path begins with a white circle, which corresponds to Ψ_{0,1} = μ. The action of the operator U(z, z′) on Ψ_{0,1} generates diagrams like the one in Fig. 10(a), which may include an arbitrary number of black circles. (There is only one white circle.) The vector U(z, z′)Ψ_{0,1} is the sum of all such diagrams. We can write U(z,z^{′})Ψ_{0,1}=∑m=0∞C_{m}μξ^{m}, where C_{m}μ ξ^{m} denotes the sum of all diagrams with one white circle and m black circles. From the graphical interpretation of the transmission and reflection coefficients given by Figs. 6(a) and 6(b), we can see that C_{m}=τ(z,z^{′})[Rr(z,z′)]{m}. Therefore,
[The last equality is definition (7.10).] Thus, U(z,z^{′})μ=T^(z,z^{′}) [see (7.9)]. The geometric series in (10.2) can be expressed graphically as in Fig. 10(b).
Taking the inner product of U(z, z′)Ψ_{0,1} with Ψ_{0,1} picks out C_{1} from UΨ_{0,1}=∑m=0∞C_{m}μξ^{m}. That is, ⟨Ψ_{0,1}, U(z, z′)Ψ_{0,1}⟩ = C_{1} = τ(z, z′). Graphically, taking the inner product with Ψ_{0,1} means selecting the diagrams with no black circles. We retrieve Fig. 7(a) from Fig. 10(a) by picking out only the diagrams with no black circles (and then removing the white circle).
Let us assume that z′ < y ≤ x < z. (We will let z → +∞ and z′ → −∞ later.) In order to consider the Green function G(x, y), we need to deal with a path that has endpoints at y and x. The endpoints of a path are created by the operators K_{+} + L_{−} = μ^{2}(∂/∂μ) + μ(∂/∂ξ) + ξμ(∂/∂ξ) and K_{−} − L_{+} = (∂/∂μ) + ξ(∂/∂μ). The meaning of each term in these operators is illustrated in Fig. 11. Each of the three terms in K_{+} + L_{−} increases the number n of white circles by one, and each of the two terms in K_{−} − L_{+} decreases n by one. Figure 12(a) shows three examples of a path with endpoints at y and x. Diagrams including such paths can be generated by the action of the operators U, K_{+} + L_{−}, and K_{−} − L_{+} on the vector Ψ_{0,1} as shown in Fig. 12(b). More generally, the successive action of the operators U(y, z′), K_{+} + L_{−}, U(x, y), K_{−} − L_{+}, and U(z, x) on Ψ_{0,1} generates diagrams like Fig. 13(a), with an arbitrary number of black circles. The vector
is the sum of all such diagrams. Taking the inner product of this vector with Ψ_{0,1} singles out diagrams with no black circles. Hence, the quantity
is the sum of all diagrams such as the one in Fig. 13(b).
The diagram in Fig. 13(b) [as well as the ones in Figs. 13(a) and Fig. 12(b)] consists of two connected parts. Along with the path connecting the endpoints y and x, it includes another path running through the whole interval (z, z′). This auxiliary path is a diagram for the transmission coefficient as in Fig. 6(a), and the sum of all such diagrams amounts to τ(z, z′). Therefore, (10.4) divided by τ(z, z′) is the sum of the diagrams like the one in Fig. 13(c). Unlike Fig. 4, the diagram in Fig. 13(c) is restricted within the interval (z′, z). Removing this restriction by letting z′ → −∞ and z → +∞, we obtain 2ikG(x, y). Thus,
(The origin of the factor 2 in the denominator on the left-hand side is explained in Fig. 14.) This is the graphical meaning of Eq. (7.12) with q = 1.
The same interpretation is possible for any positive integer q = n. Each diagram contributing to ⟨Ψ_{0,n}, U(K_{−} − L_{+})U(K_{+} + L_{−})UΨ_{0,n}⟩ consists of n + 1 connected parts, namely, one path like Fig. 13(c) and n auxiliary paths penetrating the interval (z′, z). To obtain 2ikG(x, y), we need to divide out the contribution from the n auxiliary paths, which is equal to [τ(z, z′)]^{n} multiplied by an appropriate combinatorial factor. This is the meaning of the denominator in (7.12) with q = n.
It is also possible to study the evolution of the main path itself, without auxiliary paths. To do so, we consider the evolution starting from the point y. Let us truncate a diagram for 2ikG(x, y) (such as the one in Fig. 5) at y + ϵ with infinitesimal ϵ > 0. Contracting the parts to the right of y + ϵ as we did in Fig. 7, we obtain a diagram with one white circle and an arbitrary number of black circles. Such diagrams are classified into two types as shown in Fig. 15(a), according to the initial direction of the path at y (rightward in the upper diagram, leftward in the lower one). For each type of Fig. 15(a), the sum of diagrams can be expressed as a geometric series in terms of the reflection coefficient R_{r}, as illustrated in Fig. 15(b). Putting the two sums in Fig. 15(b) together yields
This is the vector Λ_{r}(y) defined in (9.9). The evolution of the single-line path connecting y and x can be studied by examining the action of U and K_{−} + L_{+} on Λ_{r}(y). This is what was done in Sec. IX.
So far, our discussion has been formal and we have not paid attention to the convergence of the various sums of diagrams. Actually, these sums are not necessarily convergent. To begin with, the expression of the Green function as a perturbation series [Eq. (10.1) or (J1)] is, in general, divergent. The sums of diagrams for the transmission and reflection coefficients in Fig. 6 are not necessarily convergent, either. However, such divergence does not cause any problem to our method. As can be seen from the calculation in Sec. VII, our results can always be expressed in terms of transmission and reflection coefficients. Even if the sums of diagrams in Fig. 6 are not convergent, the transmission and reflection coefficients defined by (2.7) are finite and well-defined quantities. A divergent series in terms of the bare scattering (denoted by a cross in Fig. 3) can be rearranged into a convergent series in terms of transmission and reflection coefficients. For example, the sum of diagrams in Fig. 15(a) may be divergent. In Fig. 15(b), this possibly divergent multiple scattering series is reinterpreted as a series of multiple reflections. This multiple-reflection series [Eq. (10.6)] is convergent for |ξ| < 1 since |R_{r}| ≤ 1. In (7.24), the Green function is expressed in terms of transmission and reflection coefficients. This expression can be interpreted as a superposition of waves undergoing multiple reflections and transmissions. In the calculation leading to (7.24), we are, in effect, adding up multiple reflections, in the same way as in Figs. 10(b) and 15(b). The multiple-scattering picture is thus useful even if the potential is not small enough to be treated as a perturbation. The methods developed in Secs. VII–IX can be applied even to potentials that diverge as x → ±∞. [In Appendix J, we assumed f(±∞) = 0, but this assumption is actually not necessary.]
The sum-over-paths view is essential for the understanding of the Schrödinger equation, and, as explained above, the representation of SL(3, C) given by (7.3) provides a faithful description of paths in one dimension. A cross section of a path corresponds to a vector in the space spanned by (7.4). The operator U creates a path in a larger interval by connecting fragments of paths in smaller intervals and thus dictates the evolution of the path from left to right. This description applies not only to a single path but also to a multiple of paths, with endpoints at various positions. Expressions like (8.7) or (8.14) involving products of Green functions can be understood from this perspective. We can study the evolution of paths and calculate sums over paths by simply considering the action of differential operators on polynomials in ξ and μ, without need of complicated combinatorial arguments. Thus, our method provides a simple way for dealing with paths, which can possibly be applied to a wide variety of one-dimensional problems.
XI. SUMMARY AND REMARKS
In this paper, we studied the structure of solutions of the Schrödinger equation described in terms of the Lie group SL(3, C) and its Lie algebra sl(3, C). The key to the algebraic construction of solutions is Eqs. (3.11), which can be interpreted as representing the wave transmission and reflection shown in Fig. 1. Equations (3.11) come from the commutation relations (3.7), and the Q_{+} and Q_{−} satisfying (3.7) correspond to the right-going wave and the left-going wave, respectively. In the Lie algebra sl(3, C) defined by (5.1), there are two pairs of such Q_{±}, namely, Q_{+} = L_{−}, Q_{−} = K_{+} and Q_{+} = −K_{−}, Q_{−} = L_{+}. Using these operators, the Green function G(x, y) can be expressed as in (5.5), with different pairs of Q_{±} assigned to the two endpoints x and y. We can also derive more general formulas for products of Green functions, as shown in Sec. VIII. The existence of two pairs of Q_{±} (each satisfying [Q_{+}, Q_{−}] = 0) is crucial for these general formulas. Expressions like (8.7), (8.14), and (8.16) cannot be constructed with only one pair of Q_{±}.
The expressions derived in Secs. V and VIII are representation independent, that is, they can be used with any representation of the Lie group SL(3, C) and the Lie algebra sl(3, C). However, the real merits of this formalism can be appreciated when it is used in combination with an infinite-dimensional representation. The representation introduced in Sec. VII is of particular importance. As explained in Sec. X, this representation faithfully describes the transmission and reflection of waves and provides a natural picture of solutions of the Schrödinger equation as waves undergoing multiple scattering processes. In this representation, we can deduce the simple formulas of Sec. IX.
The formulas obtained in Sec. IX can be extremely useful for the analysis of the Green function. In Ref [22], we used the infinite-dimensional representation of SL(2, C) given by (7.1) for deriving low- and high-energy expansions of reflection coefficients. The same method can be used for SL(3, C) with the representation given by (7.3). The function Λ_{r} defined in Sec. IX is closely related to the generalized reflection coefficient [24]R^≡μ^{2}R_{r}/(1−ξR_{r}), which was fully studied in Ref [22]. Using the method of Ref [22] together with the results of Sec. IX, we can systematically study the analytic properties of the Green function and other quantities involving Green functions. This will be discussed elsewhere.
APPENDIX A: PROOF OF (3.6)
From (1.6) and (2.7), we can derive the differential equations for τ, R_{r}, and R_{l},
Let us show that the U(x, y) given by (3.6) satisfies (3.1). Using (A1), we have
From the commutation relations (3.5), it easily follows that
(Note that [J+n,J_{−}]=2nJ_{3}J+n−1−n(n−1)J+n−1.) Therefore, (A2) becomes
Thus, expression (3.6) indeed satisfies (3.1). Since τ(y, y) = 1 and R_{r}(y, y) = R_{l}(y, y) = 0, it is obvious that (3.2) is also satisfied.
APPENDIX B: BEHAVIOR OF ϕ_{±}(x) AS x→±∞
Using (1.8) and (2.1), we can write τ(x_{0}, z′)ψ_{−}(x, z′) as
Similarly,
The reflection coefficients R_{l}(z, x) and R_{r}(x, z′) have definite limits [19]z → ∞ and z′ → −∞, respectively. We can let z → ∞ in (B1) and z′ → −∞ in (B2) to obtain
As shown in Appendix C, the reflection coefficients always satisfy
for any x_{1} and x_{2} (either finite or infinite) and Im k ≥ 0.
Let us study the behavior of ϕ_{−}(x) as x → −∞. It can be shown [25] that, as x → −∞,
From (B4) and (B5) we see that, in all cases,
As x → −∞, the transmission coefficient τ(x_{0}, x) has the asymptotic form [26]
where η_{i}(x) = o(|x|) as x → −∞ (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) and η_{4} is real valued if Im k = 0. The factors C_{i} are independent of x. In the third line of (B7), the branch of the square root is chosen as Rec^{2}−k^{2}>0 for Im k > 0. We can see from (B7) that τ(x_{0}, x) → 0 for Im k ≥ 0 if f(−∞) = ±∞ and τ(x_{0}, x) → 0 for Im k > 0 if f(−∞) = c or 0. From this and (B6), we find that ϕ_{−}(x) → 0 as x → −∞ for Im k > 0 in all cases. In particular, ϕ_{−}(x) → 0 even for real k if f(−∞) = ±∞.
In the same way, we can show that [1 + R_{l}(∞, x)]/[1 − R_{l}(∞, x)R_{r}(x, x_{0})] remains finite as x → ∞ and that τ(x, x_{0}) → 0 for Im k > 0. Hence, ϕ_{+}(x) → 0 as x → ∞ for Im k > 0. In particular, ϕ_{+}(x) → 0 for Im k ≥ 0 if f(∞) = ±∞.
APPENDIX C: PROOF OF (B4)
From the first equation of (A1) and its complex conjugate, we have
For Im k ≥ 0, we find from (C1) that (∂/∂x)|R_{r}|^{2} ≤ 0 if |R_{r}|^{2} = 1. Therefore, |R_{r}| cannot become larger than 1 by crossing |R_{r}| = 1. As |R_{r}(y, y)| = 0 for finite y, it follows that |R_{r}(x, y)| ≤ 1 for any finite y and x. Since R_{r}(x, −∞) is the limit y → −∞ of R_{r}(x, y), we also have |R_{r}(x, −∞)| ≤ 1. The inequality |R_{l}| ≤ 1 can be proved in the same way.
APPENDIX D: LESS RESTRICTIVE CONDITIONS ON Ψ AND Φ IN (3.26)
In this appendix, we prove the following statements: (i) If either Im k > 0 or f(+∞) = ±∞, the condition Q+†Φ=0 in (3.26a) can be replaced by Q+†Φ=CQ−†Φ, where C is a complex number such that |C| < 1. (ii) If either Im k > 0 or f(−∞) = ±∞, the condition Q_{−}Ψ = 0 in (3.26b) can be replaced by Q_{−}Ψ = CQ_{+}Ψ with |C| < 1.
From (3.11), we have
Substituting (D1) into the last term of (D2), substituting (D2) into the last term of (D1), and then adding together the resulting two equations, we obtain
Suppose that Q_{−}Ψ = CQ_{+}Ψ with |C| < 1. Then,
Substituting (D5) into (D3) gives
The first term of (D6) is identical to (B1) with x_{0} = z. Using (B5) and (B7) of Appendix B, we can see that the second term of (D6) vanishes in the limit z′ → −∞ if Im k > 0 or f(−∞) = ±∞. This means that (3.26b) holds with Q_{−}Ψ = CQ_{+}Ψ instead of Q_{−}Ψ = 0. Note that the condition |C| < 1 can be relaxed to |C| ≤ 1, C ≠ −1 if f(−∞) = +∞, and |C| ≤ 1, C ≠ 1 if f(−∞) = −∞. In the same way, it can be shown that (3.26a) holds with Q+†Φ=CQ−†Φ instead of Q+†=0 if Im k > 0 or f(+∞) = ±∞.
APPENDIX E: LIE SUPERALGEBRA osp(1/2)
The orthosymplectic superalgebra [27]osp(1/2) is defined by the commutation relations
which also involve the anticommutator defined by {A, B}≡ AB + BA. The operators J_{±}, J_{3}, and Q_{±} of (3.7) can be identified with the elements of osp(1/2). We can use (4.14) with various representations of osp(1/2). A particularly useful representation is given by
where a and a^{†} are boson annihilation-creation operators satisfying [a, a^{†}] = 1. Expressions of the Green function using the boson representation and other representations of osp(1/2) were studied in Ref [28].
The superalgebra osp(1/2) contains a minimal number of elements to fulfill the commutation relations (3.7). The structure of the Schrödinger equation described by osp(1/2) is, in some sense, a reduced form of the SL(3, C) structure studied in this paper. The general formulas derived in Sec. VII of this paper cannot be constructed with osp(1/2).
APPENDIX F: PROOF OF (7.6) AND (7.8)
Equations (7.3) and (7.4) give
From (F1) and (7.5), we can see that the nonzero matrix elements of J_{+}, K_{+}, and L_{+} are
It follows from (F2) that J±†=−J_{∓}, L±†=−L_{∓}, and K±†=K_{∓}. Since the Ψ_{i,j} are eigenvectors of J_{3}, K_{3}, and L_{3}, it is obvious that J3†=J_{3}, K3†=K_{3}, and L3†=L_{3}.
To prove (7.8), it is sufficient to show that ⟨Ψ_{p′,q′}, Ψ_{p,q}⟩ given by (7.8) is identical to (7.5). We set ξ ≡ re^{iθ} and μ ≡ se^{iϕ} and rewrite (7.8) using dξ_{1}dξ_{2} = rdrdθ and dμ_{2}dμ_{2} = sdsdϕ. When we substitute Ψ = Ψ_{p,q} and Φ = Ψ_{p′,q′} into this expression, the integrals over θ and ϕ produce ∫02πe^{i(p−p′)θ}dθ=2πδ_{pp^{′}} and ∫02πe^{i(q−q′)ϕ}dϕ=2πδ_{qq^{′}}, and so
Setting t ≡ r^{2} and using the formula ∫01t^{x−1}(1−t){y−1}dt=Γ(x)Γ(y)/Γ(x+y), we find that (F3) coincides with the right-hand side of (7.5).
APPENDIX G: PROOF OF (7.21)
Since T^(z,z^{′};ξ,μ)=U(z,z^{′})μ and U(z, z′) = U(3)U(2)U(1), we have
Setting ξ = 0 and μ = 1, we obtain (7.21).
APPENDIX H: PROOF OF (8.16)
Assume that Ψ_{0} is a nonzero vector such that L−−nΨ_{0} exists and K_{+}Ψ_{0} = 0. Let Ψ_{a}≡L−−nΨ_{0}. Then, K_{+}Ψ_{a}=K_{+}L−−nΨ_{0}=L−−nK_{+}Ψ_{0}=0 and L−nΨ_{a}=Ψ_{0}≠0. As Ψ_{a} satisfies both K_{+}Ψ_{a} = 0 and L−nΨ_{a}≠0, from (8.2) we have (L−+K+){n}UΨ_{a}=[(1+Rr)/τ]{n}UL−nΨ_{a}. Applying (L−+K+){−n} to both sides of this equation and substituting Ψ_{a}=L−−nΨ_{0} gives
In the same way, it can be shown that
where Φ_{0} is a nonzero vector such that (L+−n){†}Φ_{0} exists and K−†Φ_{0}=0. Let Φ_{a}≡(L+−n){†}Φ_{0}. Since K−†Φ_{a}=0, from (8.4) we have ⟨Φ_{a},L+nU⋯⟩=τ^{n}⟨Φ_{a},UL+n⋯⟩, and hence ⟨Φ_{a},L+nUL+−n⋯⟩=τ^{n}⟨Φ_{a},U⋯⟩. Substituting Φ_{a}=(L+−n){†}Φ_{0}, we obtain
Using (H1)–(H3), we have
From (8.6) with (H4), it can be seen that (8.16) holds.
APPENDIX I: DERIVATION OF (8.18) AND (8.20)
The operators L_{−} and L_{−} + K_{+} act on functions of the form μ^{m}h(ξ) (m > 0) as
The right-hand side of (I2) vanishes if h(ξ) = (1 + ξ)^{−m}, so L_{−} + K_{+} is not invertible if μ^{m}(1 + ξ)^{−m} is included in its domain. We can exclude such functions by restricting the domain of L_{−} + K_{+} to functions Ψ(ξ, μ) satisfying |Ψ(−1, μ)| < ∞, so we assume |h(−1)| < ∞ in (I2). Defining g(ξ) by (L_{−} + K_{+})μ^{m}h(ξ) = μ^{m+1}g(ξ), we can invert (I2) as
The lower limit of the integral in (I3) is −1 on account of the assumption |h(−1)| < ∞. By replacing m with m − 1, we obtain (8.18b). Equation (8.18a) can be derived in an analogous way from (I1). The lower limit of the integral in (8.18a) is zero because |h(0)| < ∞.
From (8.18b), we have
for any complex number c. The integral on the right-hand side of (I4) can be calculated by setting t = 1 + ξ and α = c/(1 + c) and using
As a result, we have
Equation (8.20) is obtained from (I6) by iteration.
APPENDIX J: EXPRESSION OF MULTIPLE SCATTERING IN TERMS OF f
We can formally express the Green function as a perturbative series in terms of V_{S},
where G_{0} denotes the unperturbed Green function (that is, the Green function for V_{S} = 0). The explicit form of G_{0} is
as can be checked by substituting into (4.1) with V_{S} = 0. Substituting (1.4) and (J2) into the second term on the right-hand side of (J1), and integrating by parts, we have
[Since we are treating V_{S} as a perturbation, we have assumed f(±∞) = 0.] Similarly, from the third term on the right-hand side of (J1),
where A_{2} denotes the region z_{1} ≤ y, x ≤ z_{2} and B_{2} denotes the region y ≤ z_{1}, z_{2} ≤ z_{1}, z_{2} ≤ x. [We are assuming y ≤ x, so z_{1} ≤ z_{2} in A_{2}. We can write ∫∫_{A2}dz_{1}dz_{2}=∫−∞ydz_{1}∫x∞dz_{2} and ∫∫_{B2}dz_{1}dz_{2}=∫y∞dz_{1}∫−∞min(x,z_{1})dz_{2}=∫−∞xdz_{2}∫max(y,z_{2})∞dz_{1}.] The first term on the right-hand side of (J4) cancels the first term on the right-hand side of (J3). This kind of cancellation happens at every order in f, and integrals involving [f(z)]^{2} do not remain in (J1). Substituting (J3), (J4), and so on into (J1) and writing
we obtain (10.1).
For general integer n, the terms of order 2n in (10.1) have the form
and the terms of order 2n + 1 are
where A_{2n}, B_{2n}, A_{2n+1}, and B_{2n+1} denote the following regions:
Each term of (J5) and (J4) corresponds to a path like the one in Fig. 5.
FIG. 1.

FIG. 2. 
Schematic illustration of Eqs. (3.11). (The left-right direction is reversed in the equations.)
FIG. 3. 
Graphical representation of the first five terms on the right-hand side of (10.1). The endpoints at y and x are marked by double circles. Crosses denote the points where scattering occurs. In the fifth term, z_{1} and z_{2} can move in the region y ≤ z_{1} and z_{2} ≤ x with the restriction z_{2} ≤ z_{1}.
FIG. 4. 
Rules for evaluating the diagram. (a) Each line segment connecting two points a and b (a < b) has the value exp[ik(b − a)]. (b) Scattering at point z gives a factor ±f(z).
FIG. 5. 
A diagram representing a path that connects two endpoints y and x in one-dimensional space. The horizontal direction of the diagram corresponds to the spatial coordinate. (The vertical direction does not have any particular meaning.) The Green function G(x, y) multiplied by 2ik is obtained as the sum of all diagrams like this one.
FIG. 6. 
Diagrams for (a) the transmission coefficient τ(x_{2}, x_{1}), (b) the right reflection coefficient R_{r}(x_{2}, x_{1}), and (c) the left reflection coefficient R_{l}(x_{2}, x_{1}).
FIG. 7. 
(a) A diagram representing a path in the interval (z′, z). (b) Parts of the path in the interval (x, z) (rectangular boxes) are contracted to black and white circles. (c) The diagram thus obtained from (b).
FIG. 8. 
The meaning of each term in −2f J_{1} = −f(∂/∂ξ) + fξ^{2}(∂/∂ξ) + fξμ(∂/∂μ). The operator ∂/∂ξ annihilates a black circle, ξ^{2}(∂/∂ξ) turns a black circle into two black circles, and ξμ(∂/∂μ) turns a white circle into a pair of white and black circles. The factor ±f corresponds to a scattering vertex as in Fig. 4(b).
FIG. 9. 
The path shown in (a) is generated as in (b), by a combination of the processes A–C of Fig. 8.
FIG. 10. 
(a) A diagram contributing to U(z, z′)Ψ_{0,1}. (b) Expression of U(z, z′)Ψ_{0,1} in terms of τ and R_{r}.
FIG. 11. 
The meaning of each term in K_{+} + L_{−} = μ^{2}(∂/∂μ) + μ(∂/∂ξ) + ξμ(∂/∂ξ) and K_{−} − L_{+} = (∂/∂μ) + ξ(∂/∂μ). As in Fig. 3, a double circle means an endpoint of a path.
FIG. 12. 
The three paths in (a) are generated through the processes shown in (b), by the action of the operators U (A–C of Fig. 8), K_{+} + L_{−} (D–F of Fig. 11), and K_{−} + L_{+} (G and H of Fig. 11) on the vector Ψ_{0,1}.
FIG. 13. 
(a) A typical diagram contributing to (10.3). (b) A typical diagram contributing to (10.4). (c) A diagram representing a single path restricted within the interval (z′, z). The sum of (b) is equal to the sum of (c) multiplied by τ(z, z′).
FIG. 14. 
Diagrams (a) and (b) have the same value, so we can replace (a) with (b). Thus, diagrams of type (a) (in which the two endpoints are disconnected) can be disregarded if diagrams of type (b) (with the endpoints connected) are counted twice. This gives the factor 2 in (10.5).
FIG. 15. 
(a) Two types of diagrams obtained by truncating a single-line path at y + ϵ. (b) For each type in (a), the sum of diagrams can be expressed in terms of R_{r}, in the same way as in Fig. 10(b).
