Stochastic mixed-mode oscillations in a three-species predator-prey model
The effect of demographic stochasticity, in the form of Gaussian white noise, in a predator-prey model with one fast and two slow variables is studied. We derive the stochastic differential equations (SDEs) from a discrete model. For suitable parameter values, the deterministic drift part of the model admits a folded node singularity and exhibits a singular Hopf bifurcation. We focus on the parameter regime near the Hopf bifurcation, where small amplitude oscillations exist as stable dynamics in the absence of noise. In this regime, the stochastic model admits noise-driven mixed-mode oscillations (MMOs), which capture the intermediate dynamics between two cycles of population outbreaks. We perform numerical simulations to calculate the distribution of the random number of small oscillations between successive spikes for varying noise intensities and distance to the Hopf bifurcation. We also study the effect of noise on a suitable Poincaré map. Finally, we prove that the stochastic model can be transformed into a normal form near the folded node, which can be linked to recent results on the interplay between deterministic and stochastic small amplitude oscillations. The normal form can also be used to study the parameter influence on the noise level near folded singularities.
I. INTRODUCTION
Stochasticity or variability plays an important role in understanding the dynamics of predator-prey populations. In many cases, it helps to explain observable population phenomena such as random fluctuations in population densities of small mammals and forest insects [4,27,36]. Higher per-capita growth rate of the prey than its predators can be modeled to naturally give rise to systems of singularly perturbed differential equations [17,24,39,43]. Noise in such models can lead to several interesting dynamical effects, which are not anticipated by their deterministic counterpart [44].
There are several ways to model variability in population ecology [16]. These include variations between individuals usually referred to as demographic stochasticity or variations caused by temporal changes in the environment, usually called environmental variations. In this paper, we will assume that variations in between individuals follow a certain probability distribution. In this form of modeling, all individuals in the same population are treated as identical in all aspects of phenotype, and the randomness enters as a within-individual process having the same probability distribution for every individual regardless of its phenotype. We build a stochastic model and derive when the population sizes are large, where the dynamics is approximated by a system of SDEs. A similar approach to modeling two or more interacting populations with demographic stochasticity naturally built-in has been considered in Refs [1–3].
We consider the stochastic dynamics between three interacting populations, two predators competing for their common prey, under two different timescales. The deterministic model, i.e., the drift terms in the SDEs, has been extensively studied in Refs [42],  [43], and  [45]. Of the many interesting dynamics that the deterministic model shows are MMOs, which are concatenations of small and large amplitude oscillations [14,18,32]. The MMO cycles are ecologically significant as they qualitatively represent natural fluctuations in the population densities of species as observed in the wild. Taking demographic stochasticity into account, we obtain the interactions in the framework of a fast-slow system of SDEs. We focus our study regarding noise effects in a parameter regime near the singular Hopf bifurcation, where noise-induced MMOs are observed. Though noise-induced MMOs have been studied in various physical systems [10,11,37], to the best of our knowledge, they have not been previously explored in three or more interacting populations. Our results show that the distance to the singular Hopf bifurcation and noise level are crucial parameters for the formation of different oscillation patterns. Large noise levels lead to stochastic extinction events, while very low noise levels preclude frequent noise-induced large amplitude oscillations (LAOs). Furthermore, parts of canard-type orbits near unstable manifolds are kicked away by small perturbations, thus “regularizing” the Poincaré map. Therefore, we conclude that optimal finite-size noise is beneficial in those predator-prey systems, where switching between alternating ecological regimes may be desirable. Hence, our model is a more complex example of the classical paradigms of stochastic/coherent resonance [6,21,34,38], which are frequently studied in neuroscience [35], and also provides a new direction to explore other noise-induced mechanisms [31].
In this paper, we make an attempt to understand the interplay between singularities in fast-slow systems and noise, which has gained considerable attention recently [7,9]. We therefore transform our system to a suitable normal form locally; this seems to be the first three-dimensional realistic SODE model with multiplicative noise, where such a transformation near folded nodes has been carried out. Finally, we compare our model results to theoretical predictions. In summary, we have provided a paradigmatic example from applications, where we combine modeling, stochastic fast-slow systems, numerical simulations, and algebra to gain insight into oscillatory patterns and multi-stability.
The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we introduce the deterministic model and review relevant theory of fast-slow systems. Existence of folded nodes and canards are also discussed in this section. In Sec. III, we build our main fast-slow stochastic model, and we perform numerical simulations and discuss the results. In Sec. IV, the stochastic model is transformed to its normal form and the implications are discussed. The derivation of the normal form is provided in the Appendix.
II. THE DETERMINISTIC MODEL
Before starting with the full stochastic model, we have to understand the deterministic aspects of the dynamics. This part forms the skeleton of our analysis as we are interested in small stochastic perturbations of deterministic dynamics. The deterministic model in its non-dimensional form with the derivation details provided in Ref [45] reads as
where x is the normalized population density of the prey and y and z are the normalized population densities of the predators. We consider a logistic growth of the prey and the interaction between the prey and its predators are governed by a Holling type II response. We always restrict our study to the first quadrant x≥0,y≥0,z≥0 due to the natural non-negativity assumption in population dynamics. The parameters ζ_{1}, ζ_{2}, β_{1}, β_{2}, c, d, and h represent the following:
• ζ_{1},ζ_{2} denote the ratios of the maximum per capita growth rates of the predators y and z, respectively, to the per-capita growth rate of the prey. As commonly observed in real ecosystems, we will assume that the growth rate of the prey is much larger than of its predators. This leads to 0<ζ_{1},ζ_{2}≪1. For simplicity, we consider ζ_{1}=ζ_{2}=:ζ.
• The parameters β_{1} and β_{2} are dimensionless semi-saturation constants measured against the prey's carrying capacity. We will assume that the predators will reach the half of their maximum predation rates before the prey population reaches its carrying capacity implying that 0<β_{1},β_{2}<1; see Ref [17].
• The parameters c and d denote the ratios of the maximum growth rates of the predators to their death rates. We will make the natural assumption that 0<c,d<1, otherwise the predators will die out faster than they can reproduce even at their maximum reproduction rates.
• The parameter h is associated with the intraspecific competition within z. In our context, h > 1 will indicate the presence of a strong intraspecific competition while 0<h<1 will indicate a weaker competition.
With the assumption ζ≪1, we obtain a singularly perturbed system in one fast and two slow variables which can be written on the fast time scale as
where u(x,y,z),v(x,y,z),w(x,y,z) represent the nontrivial x, y, and z nullclines. Hence, we may apply techniques from fast-slow systems [32]. The critical manifoldM is the set of equilibria of the fast subsystem, i.e.,
where T={(0,y,z):y,z≥0} and S={(x,y,z):u(x,y,z)=0}. The critical manifold consists of two normally attracting sheets S^{a} and T^{a}, and two repelling sheets S^{r} and T^{r}, separated by two curves of singularities F^{+} and F^{−} (see Refs [42] and  [45]). The normally hyperbolic parts perturb to slow manifolds by Fenichel's Theorem [20,32]. The curve F^{−} of transcritical points is the intersection of T with S. The curve F^{+}={(x,y,z):u(x,y,z)=0,u_{x}(x,y,z)=0} is a curve of fold points. On rescaling s:=ζt, (2) transforms to an equivalent system written on the slow time scale s. On letting ζ→0 on this scale, one obtains the slow subsystem (or reduced subsystem). The corresponding dynamics is referred to as the slow flow which is restricted to the plane {x=0} or to the surface S:={(x,y,z):u(x,y,z)=0}. Since u_{y}≠0 on S, the implicit function theorem implies that S can be locally written as a graph of y=ϕ(x,z). Differentiating u(x,y,z)=0 implicitly with respect to slow time yields
Consequently, the slow flow restricted to S reads as
Multiplying the vector field by a factor −u_{x}, and then using a suitable time re-scaling, transforms (3) to the desingularized system
The set of all points on F^{+} for which u_{y}yv+u_{z}zw≠0 corresponds to jump points and is said to satisfy the normal switching condition [5,32,46]. At these points, solutions jump from S^{a} to T^{a}. Similarly, one can treat jump points at the curves of transcritical singularities in T [28,33]. This gives rise to relaxation-oscillation dynamics as shown in Fig. 1(b). Points on F^{+} that violate the normal switching condition are known as folded singularities [5,32,46]. These are equilibria of the desingularized system (4). Folded singularities can be classified into their equilibrium type, e.g., one generically obtains folded nodes, folded foci, and folded saddles without parameter variation; further degeneracies occur, e.g., folded-saddle nodes [29,48] and/or singular Hopf bifurcation [12,23].
Under suitable parameter values, the desingularized system (4) admits a folded node singularity (x^{⋆},y^{⋆},z^{⋆}). Suppose that λ_{s},λ_{w} are the eigenvalues of the Jacobian corresponding to (4) at (x^{⋆},y^{⋆},z^{⋆}) such that λ_{s}<λ_{w}<0. The perturbation for 0<ζ≪1 of trajectories tangent to the eigendirections for ζ = 0 corresponding to eigenvalues λ_{s},λ_{w} gives rise to primary canards, known as the strong canard, and the weak canard is denoted by γsζ and γwζ, respectively [5,32,46,48]. The singular funnel refers to the region on S^{a} bounded by the strong singular canard, γs0, and the fold curve F^{+}. It contains trajectories flowing through the folded node. For 0<ζ≪1, these trajectories experience small rotations around the weak canard until they jump to the other attracting sheet of the manifold T^{a}. A global return mechanism can re-inject trajectories to the folded-node funnel to induce MMOs. The global return mechanism can be represented by a return map Π:Σ^{+}→Σ^{+}, where Σ^{+} is a cross-section orthogonal to the x-axis away from the fold F^{+} such that for small ζ, all trajectories that are projected into the slow manifold Sζa onto a neighborhood of the funnel intersect with Σ^{+}. As shown in Fig. 1(b), the map Π can be decomposed as Π=Π_{G}°Π_{L}, where Π_{L}:Σ^{+}→Σ^{−} defines the local map near the fold (shown in green) and Π_{G}:Σ^{−}→Σ^{+} the global return map (in black) [18,30]. We will study a stochastic variant of one part of this return map in Sec. III.
Suppose we are in a parameter regime such that (2) has a folded node singularity at (x^{⋆},y^{⋆},z^{⋆}). Consider the eigenvalue ratio
Then one may conclude [32,46,48], for sufficiently small ζ>0, the strong singular canard γs0 perturbs to a maximal canard γsζ and if μ^{−1}∉ℕ, the singular weak canard γw0 perturbs to a maximal canard γwζ. Moreover if k∈ℕ be such that
there exists k other additional canards referred to as secondary canards. In this case, the strong singular canard γs0 twists around the primary weak canard γwζ. The j-th secondary canard γjζ,1≤j≤k twists 2j+1 times around γwζ. The twisting occurs in an O(ζ)-neighborhood of the folded node (x^{⋆},y^{⋆},z^{⋆}). This mechanism induces small-amplitude oscillations (SAOs). A related mechanism of SAO generation is the case, when a folded saddle-node of type II occurs in system (4), or more commonly, a singular Hopf bifurcation occurs in system (2) [23,32,46]. In this case, SAOs are induced by dynamics near an equilibrium point of the full system with complex conjugate eigenvalues [18]. To illustrate this in our context, we fix the parameter values to
and view h as the main bifurcation parameter. As discussed in Ref [42], system (2) exhibits a Hopf bifurcation at the coexistence equilibrium state at
and the desingularized system (4) undergoes a folded saddle-node bifurcation of type II at
In the singular limit where FSN II occurs, the coexistence equilibrium point is still an attractor of the full system. It loses its stability at the Hopf bifurcation, where a stable periodic orbit is born.
Hence, the deterministic model shows many classical features, which have been studied in other fast-slow system models, mainly in chemical reactions and neuroscience [32,40,41].
III. THE STOCHASTIC MODEL
In this section, we will build and analyze a stochastic variant of (2). Our first step is to justify the structure of the noise terms from a microscopic description by modeling the changes in the populations due to births and deaths of species as discrete time Markov processes on a discrete state space. We will consider large population sizes so that we can apply the law of large numbers allowing us to use continuous variables and differential equations in a mean-field limit [22]. A similar approach has been taken in Refs [1],  [3], and  [15] for modeling the interactions between a predator and its prey. We will observe that though the covariance matrix of our system is diagonal, our derivation takes the random contributions of each species in determining the probabilities of a birth or a death, making the noise multiplicative, and thus correlating the noise for the three interacting populations. This form also agrees with the structure of the covariance matrix obtained in the formulation of stochastic predator-prey models in Chapter 5 of Ref [1] and Chapter 9 of Ref [3]. Although it is possible to derive other stochastic models with the same drift terms as in the current model, but with nonzero off-diagonal entries in the covariance matrix representing the effect of migration, etc., which we do not take into account, as our focus is to understand the interplay between SAOs caused by the deterministic process due to the Hopf bifurcation and the noise-induced SAOs in a basic ecological setting. Since the prey and its predators evolve at different time-scales (prey having a faster reproductive rate than its predators), it is important to model the changes in each population group separately. The derivation of our stochastic model is thus a natural extension of modeling multivariate Itô SDE processes in Refs [1] and  [3] while preserving the time scale separation. It is also worthwhile to mention that we interpret the growth rates of the species as arithmetic average growth rates and use Itô calculus in this paper. However, one could have used Stratonovich calculus and obtained the same results by interpreting the growth rates as geometric average growth rates [13]. Regardless of the interpretation we make about the average growth rates, the noise terms are considered to be significantly small in our model, and therefore any Itô-Stratonovich correction would appear only as a higher-order term in the deterministic drift part and would not have contributed much to the analysis.
To this end, let ω_{1}x(s) be an integer denoting the number of individuals of prey at time s. In other words, x units of prey corresponds to ω_{1}x individuals. Similarly, let ω_{2}y(s) and ω_{3}z(s) be integers denoting the number of individuals of two different predator species at time s. Let {Δ_{1}X,Δ_{2}X,…Δ_{Nx}X} be a set of random variables representing possible changes within the prey population corresponding to N_{x} observations done over a given interval of time [s,s+Δs]. Assuming that no simultaneous births or deaths or multiple births and deaths occur at any observation, we assign Δ_{i}X equals 1 if a birth occurs, –1 if a death occurs and 0 if no changes occur. We also assume that the random events of births and deaths are independent of each other. Consequently, the random variables {Δ_{i}X}i=1N_{x} are independent. Suppose the transitional probabilities of Δ_{i}X denoted by p_{i}=p_{i}(x,y,z,s) are defined by
for i=1,2,…N_{x}.
We note that the transitional probabilities depend on all the three interacting populations and on the current time. We will assume that Δs is sufficiently small and N_{x} is sufficiently large, so that Δ_{i}X are identically distributed, which only depends on the current state variables x(s),y(s), and z(s). Under such assumptions, it follows that the change in the prey population in the interval [s,s+Δs] will be given by ∑i=1N_{x}Δ_{i}X=ω_{1}x(s+Δs)−ω_{1}x(s). Taking the fast growth rate of the prey into account, suppose that the number of observations N_{x} made during [s,s+Δs] is proportional to the size of the population and the time-scale separation 1/ζ. To this end, we choose
Hence, the expectation and the variance of the random variables Δ_{i}X and ∑i=1N_{x}Δ_{i}X read as
where
Assuming that ω_{1} is sufficiently large, it follows from the Central Limit Theorem, ∑i=1N_{x}Δ_{i}X has an approximate normal distribution with mean ω_{1}f_{1}(x,y,z)Δs/ζ and variance ω_{1}F12(x,y,z)Δs/ζ, i.e.,
where F_{1}(x,y,z) is the positive square root of (9) and
The approximation improves for large N_{x} (for large population size). Since the variable x represents the number of individuals of prey divided by ω_{1}, the change in x during [s,s+Δs] will be thus given by
where η_{x}∼N(0,1) is the standard one-dimensional Wiener process. Assuming that the stochastic integral exists in the sense of Itô with Δsη_{x}→dWs(1) as Δs→0, where Ws(1) is a Wiener process, and interpreting the convergence in the mean square sense, we obtain that
Similarly, let {Δ_{i}Y}i=1N_{y} and {Δ_{i}Z}i=1N_{z} be the random variables representing changes in the populations of the predators over the time interval [s,s+Δs], taking values ±1 or 0 with transitional probabilities given in Table I.
Suppose that N_{y} and N_{z} are proportional to the size of the respective populations. Taking into account that the predators grow at a slower rate than their prey, we define N_{y} and N_{z} by
Then similar to the derivation of the equation for x, the stochastic differential equations for y and z are
respectively, where
Ws(2),Ws(3) are two independent Wiener processes and the stochastic integrals are interpreted in the sense of Itô. Denoting σ_{i}=1/ω_{i} for i = 1, 2, and 3 and X_{s}, Y_{s}, and Z_{s} as the random variables for the three interacting populations, combining Eqs. (3)–(13), we thus obtain a system of SDEs interpreted in Itô-sense
where f_{i} and F_{i} are given by Eqs. (9) and (10) and Eqs. (14)–(17) for i = 1, 2, and 3.
Rescaling s=ζt and using the scaling law of Brownian motion, the equivalent fast time scale system of SDEs reads as
Systems (18) and (19) are referred to as stochastic fast-slow systems with X being the fast and Y and Z being the slow variables, and σ_{i} for i = 1, 2, and 3 are the corresponding noise parameters.
Note that σi2 is inversely proportional to the size of the population. For larger population size, we can expect the deterministic part of the process to dominate on quite long time scales [7]. Consequently, on these time scales, extremely small values of σ_{i} (for instance, σ_{1}=10^{−7},σ_{2}=σ_{3}=10^{−4}) lead to only very small deviations from the deterministic model (2).
Relatively larger values of σ_{i} [such as σ_{1}=O(10^{−3}), σ_{2}=O(10^{−5}),σ_{3}=O(10^{−4})] can lead to extinction of species as shown in Fig. 3. This is easy to see from our derivation as the noise terms vanish when the population sizes are zero.
Interestingly, for intermediate values of σ_{i} (for instance, σ_{1}=10^{−6},σ_{2}=σ_{3}=3·10^{−4}), we observe different kinds of noise-induced MMOs as shown in the numerical simulations [25] in Fig. 2. The isolated/repeated spikes in the time series in Fig. 2 represent events of random population outbreaks or collapses as documented for small mammals and insects in the wild [4,27,36]. We also observe that the noise-driven dynamics can be significantly different depending on how close we are to the singular Hopf bifurcation [cf. (7) and (8)]. Indeed, if we are below it, we see rare excursions giving rise to LAOs (isolated spikes). On the other hand, in the near Hopf-regime, due to the small stable limit cycle generated at the (singular) Hopf bifurcation, which has a part near an unstable slow manifold [18], the noise can induce LAOs more frequently. This means we really see noise-generated MMOs with two different characteristics.
Figure 2 also suggests the presence of an intricate interplay between the noise-induced SAOs and the SAOs initiated by the drift terms. To investigate this effect further, we consider the number of SAOs between two spikes and denote it by N. The distribution of N for 200 different sample paths near the Hopf bifurcation are shown in Figs. 4 and 5; in our numerical study, we considered oscillations in the x-variable. Oscillations whose amplitudes exceeded 0.1 with their maximum value below 0.6 in the x-coordinate were considered as SAOs. We observe that for parameter values above and close to the singular Hopf bifurcation, the distributions are multimodal with wider range, while below and away from the Hopf value, the distributions are reverse J-shaped with shorter range. Similarly, lower noise levels lead to unimodal distributions with long tails, while higher noise yield distributions that are reverse J-shaped (see Fig. 5). We conjecture that the reverse J-shaped distributions asymptotically approach an exponential distribution with increasing noise levels or distance from the Hopf bifurcation. Similar results have been shown in a planar model with multiplicative noise in Ref [44] and in a modified Hodgkin-Huxley model in Ref [26]. In fact, the noise-induced SAO count depends on the number of oscillations a sample path makes around the deterministically stable small limit cycle. A large excursion occurs only if the sample path gets kicked by noise from a neighborhood of this limit cycle as shown in Fig. 6. We refer to Refs [10] and  [37] for the simpler case of additive noise in planar systems, which is already highly non-trivial mathematically. We also remark that the histograms in Fig. 4 are naturally related to ecological applications, such as the distribution of return times of outbreaks of larch budmoth in European Alps [19]. To make this connection more precise would be an interesting direction for the future work.
Next, we numerically study the effect of noise on the return map which was discussed in Sec. II. We fix h at 2.3 and the other parameter values as in (6). We then consider a line segment L on a plane Σ far from F^{+}, integrate a sample path starting on equally spaced points on L forward, and record its first intersection with Σ. Figure 7 shows the image of L, where we choose Σ to be x = 0.18 and L to be a line segment on Σ with its y-coordinate fixed at 0.22, and z varying between 0.05 and 0.18. We observe that different deterministically discernible regions [cf. Figs. 7(b) and 7(f)] tend to look similar if more noise is added, i.e., the plateau disappears. Furthermore, the return maps look very regular, in certain parts even almost linear, which relates to similar observations made in Ref [30] for a simpler model.
Remark III.1:Under suitable representative parameter values, we have observed that the original discrete Poisson model with finite size population exhibits MMOs. It is the future work to detail the precise interaction between the finite model and its SDE approximation and compare the distributions of noise-induced SAOs.
IV. ANALYSIS NEAR THE FOLDED SINGULARITY
The remaining step is to link our results to theoretical background, which describes whether the SAOs are purely due to noise or have been induced by deterministic mechanisms, e.g., by a folded node. Key theoretical steps to understand this effect were made in Ref [8]. In Ref [8], the authors study a slow-fast stochastic system in its normal form, where they quantify the effect of additive noise and obtain critical noise intensities beyond which the SAOs become hidden by fluctuations. Hence, we may ask whether we can transform our system near a folded node into a suitable normal form SDE.
We will focus our analysis near a folded singularity of the desingularized system (4) and follow ideas in Ref [47], now extended to the stochastic context. Let p^{⋆}=(x^{⋆},y^{⋆},z^{⋆})∈F^{+} be a fold point where the transversality condition fails, i.e., (x^{⋆},y^{⋆},z^{⋆}) satisfy the following:
with x^{⋆}>cβ_{1}/(1−c),y^{⋆},z^{⋆}>0. The fold curve F^{+} in its parametric form is given by
Let τ^{⋆}∈(a,b) be such that τ^{⋆}=x^{⋆}, ϕ(τ^{⋆})=y^{⋆}, and ψ(τ^{⋆})=z^{⋆}, i.e., τ^{⋆} gets mapped to p^{⋆}. Then for z near z^{⋆}, we can show that F^{+} can be linearly approximated by {(c_{11}z,c_{22}z,z)}, where
provided that β_{1}≠β_{2}. Note that near p^{⋆}, it is easy to see that F_{i} can be approximated by the functions G_{i} with Fi2(x,y,z)=Gi2(x,y,z)+O((x−x⋆){2},(y−y⋆){2},(z−z⋆){2}) for i = 1, 2, and 3, where
For the ease of calculations, we will consider system (19) with F_{i} replaced by G_{i}. Throughout our work for each positive integer k, O(k) represents multivariate terms of the form X^{α}Y^{β}Z^{γ} such that α+β+γ=k, where α, β, and γ are non-negative integers.
Proposition IV.1: Near the folded node singularity (x^{⋆},y^{⋆},z^{⋆}) there exists a smooth change of coordinates such that system (19) can be written in its normal form:
where the functions are given by
with G_{1}, G_{2}, and G_{3} being the positive square roots ofG12,G22, andG32. The constants are all explicitly computable and given in(A1)–(A19).
The proof is given in the Appendix. With this normal form, we have a very explicit tool to understand the parameter influence on the noise terms near the folded node. For instance, we consider the parameter
If the two predators are similar with respect to their semi-saturation constants, i.e., β_{1}≈β_{2}, then the multiplicative noise for X near the folded node depend to leading-order only very weakly on X and Y; similar ecological parameter studies can now be carried out for various parameters and SAO counts, but we leave this aspect for the future work.
In Ref [8], the noise level influence was carried out relative to the various canard orbits. Consider the k-th secondary canard. For each k∈ℕ, let
where μ is the eigenvalue ratio at the folded node defined in (5) and χ_{k} is the noise level for additive noise near a folded node in the normal form defined [8]. The curves χ_{k}(μ) define the boundary regions in (μ,χ)-parameter space [8,9]. To link this normal form result to our context, we plot μ=μ(h) as a function of the main bifurcation parameter h as shown in Fig. 8. Basically, upon decreasing the noise level, within each region, we can distinguish more and more deterministic SAOs from pure-noise SAOs near a folded node.
To actually link the results completely, we have to determine the noise level χ, which can be done by evaluating the products σ_{i}F_{i} from (18) at the folded node. We note that the noise terms of system (20) are of the same order as of system (19) since the coordinate transformations involved in obtaining the normal form (see Appendix) are non-singular near the fold. The results are shown in Fig. 9 for parameter values given by (6). Our noise is rather small relative to χ, so we may only expect occasional stochastic deviations from SAOs in the regime far from the singular Hopf bifurcation. However, the time series in Fig. 2 show more irregular behavior, in which the theory does not cover as the SAOs occur near a singular Hopf bifurcation. The discrepancy is particularly apparent in the case when a small deterministically stable limit cycle exists (see Fig. 6). Hence, we conclude that a singular Hopf bifurcation can still produce quite irregular MMOs, even for relatively small noise levels, where a folded node normal form theory would not give an indication for the influence of noise on MMOs. To investigate this effect mathematically remains a formidable challenge for the future work.
Population dynamics is subject to demographic stochasticity. Dynamical models are crucial to understand the effect of this noise. We illustrate in the context of a predator-prey model the entire multi-stage process, starting from the derivation of the model using probabilistic fundamentals to numerical simulations and concluding with links to abstract mathematical results on normal forms. We find interesting effects related to oscillation patterns, which can be constructed from a geometric phase space decomposition. Parts of the dynamics are slow, and essentially metastable, until sudden fast tipping events occur, either induced by noise or by deterministic slow drift. The resulting MMOs can be viewed as switching in a multi-stable system.
Stochasticity or variability plays an important role in understanding the dynamics of predator-prey populations. In many cases, it helps to explain observable population phenomena such as random fluctuations in population densities of small mammals and forest insects [4,27,36]. Higher per-capita growth rate of the prey than its predators can be modeled to naturally give rise to systems of singularly perturbed differential equations [17,24,39,43]. Noise in such models can lead to several interesting dynamical effects, which are not anticipated by their deterministic counterpart [44].
There are several ways to model variability in population ecology [16]. These include variations between individuals usually referred to as demographic stochasticity or variations caused by temporal changes in the environment, usually called environmental variations. In this paper, we will assume that variations in between individuals follow a certain probability distribution. In this form of modeling, all individuals in the same population are treated as identical in all aspects of phenotype, and the randomness enters as a within-individual process having the same probability distribution for every individual regardless of its phenotype. We build a stochastic model and derive when the population sizes are large, where the dynamics is approximated by a system of SDEs. A similar approach to modeling two or more interacting populations with demographic stochasticity naturally built-in has been considered in Refs [1–3].
We consider the stochastic dynamics between three interacting populations, two predators competing for their common prey, under two different timescales. The deterministic model, i.e., the drift terms in the SDEs, has been extensively studied in Refs [42],  [43], and  [45]. Of the many interesting dynamics that the deterministic model shows are MMOs, which are concatenations of small and large amplitude oscillations [14,18,32]. The MMO cycles are ecologically significant as they qualitatively represent natural fluctuations in the population densities of species as observed in the wild. Taking demographic stochasticity into account, we obtain the interactions in the framework of a fast-slow system of SDEs. We focus our study regarding noise effects in a parameter regime near the singular Hopf bifurcation, where noise-induced MMOs are observed. Though noise-induced MMOs have been studied in various physical systems [10,11,37], to the best of our knowledge, they have not been previously explored in three or more interacting populations. Our results show that the distance to the singular Hopf bifurcation and noise level are crucial parameters for the formation of different oscillation patterns. Large noise levels lead to stochastic extinction events, while very low noise levels preclude frequent noise-induced large amplitude oscillations (LAOs). Furthermore, parts of canard-type orbits near unstable manifolds are kicked away by small perturbations, thus “regularizing” the Poincaré map. Therefore, we conclude that optimal finite-size noise is beneficial in those predator-prey systems, where switching between alternating ecological regimes may be desirable. Hence, our model is a more complex example of the classical paradigms of stochastic/coherent resonance [6,21,34,38], which are frequently studied in neuroscience [35], and also provides a new direction to explore other noise-induced mechanisms [31].
In this paper, we make an attempt to understand the interplay between singularities in fast-slow systems and noise, which has gained considerable attention recently [7,9]. We therefore transform our system to a suitable normal form locally; this seems to be the first three-dimensional realistic SODE model with multiplicative noise, where such a transformation near folded nodes has been carried out. Finally, we compare our model results to theoretical predictions. In summary, we have provided a paradigmatic example from applications, where we combine modeling, stochastic fast-slow systems, numerical simulations, and algebra to gain insight into oscillatory patterns and multi-stability.
The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we introduce the deterministic model and review relevant theory of fast-slow systems. Existence of folded nodes and canards are also discussed in this section. In Sec. III, we build our main fast-slow stochastic model, and we perform numerical simulations and discuss the results. In Sec. IV, the stochastic model is transformed to its normal form and the implications are discussed. The derivation of the normal form is provided in the Appendix.
Before starting with the full stochastic model, we have to understand the deterministic aspects of the dynamics. This part forms the skeleton of our analysis as we are interested in small stochastic perturbations of deterministic dynamics. The deterministic model in its non-dimensional form with the derivation details provided in Ref [45] reads as
where x is the normalized population density of the prey and y and z are the normalized population densities of the predators. We consider a logistic growth of the prey and the interaction between the prey and its predators are governed by a Holling type II response. We always restrict our study to the first quadrant x≥0,y≥0,z≥0 due to the natural non-negativity assumption in population dynamics. The parameters ζ_{1}, ζ_{2}, β_{1}, β_{2}, c, d, and h represent the following:
• ζ_{1},ζ_{2} denote the ratios of the maximum per capita growth rates of the predators y and z, respectively, to the per-capita growth rate of the prey. As commonly observed in real ecosystems, we will assume that the growth rate of the prey is much larger than of its predators. This leads to 0<ζ_{1},ζ_{2}≪1. For simplicity, we consider ζ_{1}=ζ_{2}=:ζ.
• The parameters β_{1} and β_{2} are dimensionless semi-saturation constants measured against the prey's carrying capacity. We will assume that the predators will reach the half of their maximum predation rates before the prey population reaches its carrying capacity implying that 0<β_{1},β_{2}<1; see Ref [17].
• The parameters c and d denote the ratios of the maximum growth rates of the predators to their death rates. We will make the natural assumption that 0<c,d<1, otherwise the predators will die out faster than they can reproduce even at their maximum reproduction rates.
• The parameter h is associated with the intraspecific competition within z. In our context, h > 1 will indicate the presence of a strong intraspecific competition while 0<h<1 will indicate a weaker competition.

With the assumption ζ≪1, we obtain a singularly perturbed system in one fast and two slow variables which can be written on the fast time scale as
where u(x,y,z),v(x,y,z),w(x,y,z) represent the nontrivial x, y, and z nullclines. Hence, we may apply techniques from fast-slow systems [32]. The critical manifoldM is the set of equilibria of the fast subsystem, i.e.,
where T={(0,y,z):y,z≥0} and S={(x,y,z):u(x,y,z)=0}. The critical manifold consists of two normally attracting sheets S^{a} and T^{a}, and two repelling sheets S^{r} and T^{r}, separated by two curves of singularities F^{+} and F^{−} (see Refs [42] and  [45]). The normally hyperbolic parts perturb to slow manifolds by Fenichel's Theorem [20,32]. The curve F^{−} of transcritical points is the intersection of T with S. The curve F^{+}={(x,y,z):u(x,y,z)=0,u_{x}(x,y,z)=0} is a curve of fold points. On rescaling s:=ζt, (2) transforms to an equivalent system written on the slow time scale s. On letting ζ→0 on this scale, one obtains the slow subsystem (or reduced subsystem). The corresponding dynamics is referred to as the slow flow which is restricted to the plane {x=0} or to the surface S:={(x,y,z):u(x,y,z)=0}. Since u_{y}≠0 on S, the implicit function theorem implies that S can be locally written as a graph of y=ϕ(x,z). Differentiating u(x,y,z)=0 implicitly with respect to slow time yields
Consequently, the slow flow restricted to S reads as
Multiplying the vector field by a factor −u_{x}, and then using a suitable time re-scaling, transforms (3) to the desingularized system
The set of all points on F^{+} for which u_{y}yv+u_{z}zw≠0 corresponds to jump points and is said to satisfy the normal switching condition [5,32,46]. At these points, solutions jump from S^{a} to T^{a}. Similarly, one can treat jump points at the curves of transcritical singularities in T [28,33]. This gives rise to relaxation-oscillation dynamics as shown in Fig. 1(b). Points on F^{+} that violate the normal switching condition are known as folded singularities [5,32,46]. These are equilibria of the desingularized system (4). Folded singularities can be classified into their equilibrium type, e.g., one generically obtains folded nodes, folded foci, and folded saddles without parameter variation; further degeneracies occur, e.g., folded-saddle nodes [29,48] and/or singular Hopf bifurcation [12,23].
Under suitable parameter values, the desingularized system (4) admits a folded node singularity (x^{⋆},y^{⋆},z^{⋆}). Suppose that λ_{s},λ_{w} are the eigenvalues of the Jacobian corresponding to (4) at (x^{⋆},y^{⋆},z^{⋆}) such that λ_{s}<λ_{w}<0. The perturbation for 0<ζ≪1 of trajectories tangent to the eigendirections for ζ = 0 corresponding to eigenvalues λ_{s},λ_{w} gives rise to primary canards, known as the strong canard, and the weak canard is denoted by γsζ and γwζ, respectively [5,32,46,48]. The singular funnel refers to the region on S^{a} bounded by the strong singular canard, γs0, and the fold curve F^{+}. It contains trajectories flowing through the folded node. For 0<ζ≪1, these trajectories experience small rotations around the weak canard until they jump to the other attracting sheet of the manifold T^{a}. A global return mechanism can re-inject trajectories to the folded-node funnel to induce MMOs. The global return mechanism can be represented by a return map Π:Σ^{+}→Σ^{+}, where Σ^{+} is a cross-section orthogonal to the x-axis away from the fold F^{+} such that for small ζ, all trajectories that are projected into the slow manifold Sζa onto a neighborhood of the funnel intersect with Σ^{+}. As shown in Fig. 1(b), the map Π can be decomposed as Π=Π_{G}°Π_{L}, where Π_{L}:Σ^{+}→Σ^{−} defines the local map near the fold (shown in green) and Π_{G}:Σ^{−}→Σ^{+} the global return map (in black) [18,30]. We will study a stochastic variant of one part of this return map in Sec. III.
Suppose we are in a parameter regime such that (2) has a folded node singularity at (x^{⋆},y^{⋆},z^{⋆}). Consider the eigenvalue ratio
Then one may conclude [32,46,48], for sufficiently small ζ>0, the strong singular canard γs0 perturbs to a maximal canard γsζ and if μ^{−1}∉ℕ, the singular weak canard γw0 perturbs to a maximal canard γwζ. Moreover if k∈ℕ be such that
there exists k other additional canards referred to as secondary canards. In this case, the strong singular canard γs0 twists around the primary weak canard γwζ. The j-th secondary canard γjζ,1≤j≤k twists 2j+1 times around γwζ. The twisting occurs in an O(ζ)-neighborhood of the folded node (x^{⋆},y^{⋆},z^{⋆}). This mechanism induces small-amplitude oscillations (SAOs). A related mechanism of SAO generation is the case, when a folded saddle-node of type II occurs in system (4), or more commonly, a singular Hopf bifurcation occurs in system (2) [23,32,46]. In this case, SAOs are induced by dynamics near an equilibrium point of the full system with complex conjugate eigenvalues [18]. To illustrate this in our context, we fix the parameter values to
and view h as the main bifurcation parameter. As discussed in Ref [42], system (2) exhibits a Hopf bifurcation at the coexistence equilibrium state at
and the desingularized system (4) undergoes a folded saddle-node bifurcation of type II at
In the singular limit where FSN II occurs, the coexistence equilibrium point is still an attractor of the full system. It loses its stability at the Hopf bifurcation, where a stable periodic orbit is born.
Hence, the deterministic model shows many classical features, which have been studied in other fast-slow system models, mainly in chemical reactions and neuroscience [32,40,41].
In this section, we will build and analyze a stochastic variant of (2). Our first step is to justify the structure of the noise terms from a microscopic description by modeling the changes in the populations due to births and deaths of species as discrete time Markov processes on a discrete state space. We will consider large population sizes so that we can apply the law of large numbers allowing us to use continuous variables and differential equations in a mean-field limit [22]. A similar approach has been taken in Refs [1],  [3], and  [15] for modeling the interactions between a predator and its prey. We will observe that though the covariance matrix of our system is diagonal, our derivation takes the random contributions of each species in determining the probabilities of a birth or a death, making the noise multiplicative, and thus correlating the noise for the three interacting populations. This form also agrees with the structure of the covariance matrix obtained in the formulation of stochastic predator-prey models in Chapter 5 of Ref [1] and Chapter 9 of Ref [3]. Although it is possible to derive other stochastic models with the same drift terms as in the current model, but with nonzero off-diagonal entries in the covariance matrix representing the effect of migration, etc., which we do not take into account, as our focus is to understand the interplay between SAOs caused by the deterministic process due to the Hopf bifurcation and the noise-induced SAOs in a basic ecological setting. Since the prey and its predators evolve at different time-scales (prey having a faster reproductive rate than its predators), it is important to model the changes in each population group separately. The derivation of our stochastic model is thus a natural extension of modeling multivariate Itô SDE processes in Refs [1] and  [3] while preserving the time scale separation. It is also worthwhile to mention that we interpret the growth rates of the species as arithmetic average growth rates and use Itô calculus in this paper. However, one could have used Stratonovich calculus and obtained the same results by interpreting the growth rates as geometric average growth rates [13]. Regardless of the interpretation we make about the average growth rates, the noise terms are considered to be significantly small in our model, and therefore any Itô-Stratonovich correction would appear only as a higher-order term in the deterministic drift part and would not have contributed much to the analysis.
To this end, let ω_{1}x(s) be an integer denoting the number of individuals of prey at time s. In other words, x units of prey corresponds to ω_{1}x individuals. Similarly, let ω_{2}y(s) and ω_{3}z(s) be integers denoting the number of individuals of two different predator species at time s. Let {Δ_{1}X,Δ_{2}X,…Δ_{Nx}X} be a set of random variables representing possible changes within the prey population corresponding to N_{x} observations done over a given interval of time [s,s+Δs]. Assuming that no simultaneous births or deaths or multiple births and deaths occur at any observation, we assign Δ_{i}X equals 1 if a birth occurs, –1 if a death occurs and 0 if no changes occur. We also assume that the random events of births and deaths are independent of each other. Consequently, the random variables {Δ_{i}X}i=1N_{x} are independent. Suppose the transitional probabilities of Δ_{i}X denoted by p_{i}=p_{i}(x,y,z,s) are defined by
for i=1,2,…N_{x}.
We note that the transitional probabilities depend on all the three interacting populations and on the current time. We will assume that Δs is sufficiently small and N_{x} is sufficiently large, so that Δ_{i}X are identically distributed, which only depends on the current state variables x(s),y(s), and z(s). Under such assumptions, it follows that the change in the prey population in the interval [s,s+Δs] will be given by ∑i=1N_{x}Δ_{i}X=ω_{1}x(s+Δs)−ω_{1}x(s). Taking the fast growth rate of the prey into account, suppose that the number of observations N_{x} made during [s,s+Δs] is proportional to the size of the population and the time-scale separation 1/ζ. To this end, we choose
Hence, the expectation and the variance of the random variables Δ_{i}X and ∑i=1N_{x}Δ_{i}X read as
where
Assuming that ω_{1} is sufficiently large, it follows from the Central Limit Theorem, ∑i=1N_{x}Δ_{i}X has an approximate normal distribution with mean ω_{1}f_{1}(x,y,z)Δs/ζ and variance ω_{1}F12(x,y,z)Δs/ζ, i.e.,
where F_{1}(x,y,z) is the positive square root of (9) and
The approximation improves for large N_{x} (for large population size). Since the variable x represents the number of individuals of prey divided by ω_{1}, the change in x during [s,s+Δs] will be thus given by
where η_{x}∼N(0,1) is the standard one-dimensional Wiener process. Assuming that the stochastic integral exists in the sense of Itô with Δsη_{x}→dWs(1) as Δs→0, where Ws(1) is a Wiener process, and interpreting the convergence in the mean square sense, we obtain that
Similarly, let {Δ_{i}Y}i=1N_{y} and {Δ_{i}Z}i=1N_{z} be the random variables representing changes in the populations of the predators over the time interval [s,s+Δs], taking values ±1 or 0 with transitional probabilities given in Table I.
Suppose that N_{y} and N_{z} are proportional to the size of the respective populations. Taking into account that the predators grow at a slower rate than their prey, we define N_{y} and N_{z} by
Then similar to the derivation of the equation for x, the stochastic differential equations for y and z are
respectively, where
Ws(2),Ws(3) are two independent Wiener processes and the stochastic integrals are interpreted in the sense of Itô. Denoting σ_{i}=1/ω_{i} for i = 1, 2, and 3 and X_{s}, Y_{s}, and Z_{s} as the random variables for the three interacting populations, combining Eqs. (3)–(13), we thus obtain a system of SDEs interpreted in Itô-sense
where f_{i} and F_{i} are given by Eqs. (9) and (10) and Eqs. (14)–(17) for i = 1, 2, and 3.
Rescaling s=ζt and using the scaling law of Brownian motion, the equivalent fast time scale system of SDEs reads as
Systems (18) and (19) are referred to as stochastic fast-slow systems with X being the fast and Y and Z being the slow variables, and σ_{i} for i = 1, 2, and 3 are the corresponding noise parameters.
Note that σi2 is inversely proportional to the size of the population. For larger population size, we can expect the deterministic part of the process to dominate on quite long time scales [7]. Consequently, on these time scales, extremely small values of σ_{i} (for instance, σ_{1}=10^{−7},σ_{2}=σ_{3}=10^{−4}) lead to only very small deviations from the deterministic model (2).
Relatively larger values of σ_{i} [such as σ_{1}=O(10^{−3}), σ_{2}=O(10^{−5}),σ_{3}=O(10^{−4})] can lead to extinction of species as shown in Fig. 3. This is easy to see from our derivation as the noise terms vanish when the population sizes are zero.
Interestingly, for intermediate values of σ_{i} (for instance, σ_{1}=10^{−6},σ_{2}=σ_{3}=3·10^{−4}), we observe different kinds of noise-induced MMOs as shown in the numerical simulations [25] in Fig. 2. The isolated/repeated spikes in the time series in Fig. 2 represent events of random population outbreaks or collapses as documented for small mammals and insects in the wild [4,27,36]. We also observe that the noise-driven dynamics can be significantly different depending on how close we are to the singular Hopf bifurcation [cf. (7) and (8)]. Indeed, if we are below it, we see rare excursions giving rise to LAOs (isolated spikes). On the other hand, in the near Hopf-regime, due to the small stable limit cycle generated at the (singular) Hopf bifurcation, which has a part near an unstable slow manifold [18], the noise can induce LAOs more frequently. This means we really see noise-generated MMOs with two different characteristics.
Figure 2 also suggests the presence of an intricate interplay between the noise-induced SAOs and the SAOs initiated by the drift terms. To investigate this effect further, we consider the number of SAOs between two spikes and denote it by N. The distribution of N for 200 different sample paths near the Hopf bifurcation are shown in Figs. 4 and 5; in our numerical study, we considered oscillations in the x-variable. Oscillations whose amplitudes exceeded 0.1 with their maximum value below 0.6 in the x-coordinate were considered as SAOs. We observe that for parameter values above and close to the singular Hopf bifurcation, the distributions are multimodal with wider range, while below and away from the Hopf value, the distributions are reverse J-shaped with shorter range. Similarly, lower noise levels lead to unimodal distributions with long tails, while higher noise yield distributions that are reverse J-shaped (see Fig. 5). We conjecture that the reverse J-shaped distributions asymptotically approach an exponential distribution with increasing noise levels or distance from the Hopf bifurcation. Similar results have been shown in a planar model with multiplicative noise in Ref [44] and in a modified Hodgkin-Huxley model in Ref [26]. In fact, the noise-induced SAO count depends on the number of oscillations a sample path makes around the deterministically stable small limit cycle. A large excursion occurs only if the sample path gets kicked by noise from a neighborhood of this limit cycle as shown in Fig. 6. We refer to Refs [10] and  [37] for the simpler case of additive noise in planar systems, which is already highly non-trivial mathematically. We also remark that the histograms in Fig. 4 are naturally related to ecological applications, such as the distribution of return times of outbreaks of larch budmoth in European Alps [19]. To make this connection more precise would be an interesting direction for the future work.
Next, we numerically study the effect of noise on the return map which was discussed in Sec. II. We fix h at 2.3 and the other parameter values as in (6). We then consider a line segment L on a plane Σ far from F^{+}, integrate a sample path starting on equally spaced points on L forward, and record its first intersection with Σ. Figure 7 shows the image of L, where we choose Σ to be x = 0.18 and L to be a line segment on Σ with its y-coordinate fixed at 0.22, and z varying between 0.05 and 0.18. We observe that different deterministically discernible regions [cf. Figs. 7(b) and 7(f)] tend to look similar if more noise is added, i.e., the plateau disappears. Furthermore, the return maps look very regular, in certain parts even almost linear, which relates to similar observations made in Ref [30] for a simpler model.
Remark III.1:Under suitable representative parameter values, we have observed that the original discrete Poisson model with finite size population exhibits MMOs. It is the future work to detail the precise interaction between the finite model and its SDE approximation and compare the distributions of noise-induced SAOs.
The remaining step is to link our results to theoretical background, which describes whether the SAOs are purely due to noise or have been induced by deterministic mechanisms, e.g., by a folded node. Key theoretical steps to understand this effect were made in Ref [8]. In Ref [8], the authors study a slow-fast stochastic system in its normal form, where they quantify the effect of additive noise and obtain critical noise intensities beyond which the SAOs become hidden by fluctuations. Hence, we may ask whether we can transform our system near a folded node into a suitable normal form SDE.
We will focus our analysis near a folded singularity of the desingularized system (4) and follow ideas in Ref [47], now extended to the stochastic context. Let p^{⋆}=(x^{⋆},y^{⋆},z^{⋆})∈F^{+} be a fold point where the transversality condition fails, i.e., (x^{⋆},y^{⋆},z^{⋆}) satisfy the following:
with x^{⋆}>cβ_{1}/(1−c),y^{⋆},z^{⋆}>0. The fold curve F^{+} in its parametric form is given by
Let τ^{⋆}∈(a,b) be such that τ^{⋆}=x^{⋆}, ϕ(τ^{⋆})=y^{⋆}, and ψ(τ^{⋆})=z^{⋆}, i.e., τ^{⋆} gets mapped to p^{⋆}. Then for z near z^{⋆}, we can show that F^{+} can be linearly approximated by {(c_{11}z,c_{22}z,z)}, where
provided that β_{1}≠β_{2}. Note that near p^{⋆}, it is easy to see that F_{i} can be approximated by the functions G_{i} with Fi2(x,y,z)=Gi2(x,y,z)+O((x−x⋆){2},(y−y⋆){2},(z−z⋆){2}) for i = 1, 2, and 3, where
For the ease of calculations, we will consider system (19) with F_{i} replaced by G_{i}. Throughout our work for each positive integer k, O(k) represents multivariate terms of the form X^{α}Y^{β}Z^{γ} such that α+β+γ=k, where α, β, and γ are non-negative integers.
Proposition IV.1: Near the folded node singularity (x^{⋆},y^{⋆},z^{⋆}) there exists a smooth change of coordinates such that system (19) can be written in its normal form:
where the functions are given by
with G_{1}, G_{2}, and G_{3} being the positive square roots ofG12,G22, andG32. The constants are all explicitly computable and given in(A1)–(A19).
The proof is given in the Appendix. With this normal form, we have a very explicit tool to understand the parameter influence on the noise terms near the folded node. For instance, we consider the parameter
If the two predators are similar with respect to their semi-saturation constants, i.e., β_{1}≈β_{2}, then the multiplicative noise for X near the folded node depend to leading-order only very weakly on X and Y; similar ecological parameter studies can now be carried out for various parameters and SAO counts, but we leave this aspect for the future work.
In Ref [8], the noise level influence was carried out relative to the various canard orbits. Consider the k-th secondary canard. For each k∈ℕ, let
where μ is the eigenvalue ratio at the folded node defined in (5) and χ_{k} is the noise level for additive noise near a folded node in the normal form defined [8]. The curves χ_{k}(μ) define the boundary regions in (μ,χ)-parameter space [8,9]. To link this normal form result to our context, we plot μ=μ(h) as a function of the main bifurcation parameter h as shown in Fig. 8. Basically, upon decreasing the noise level, within each region, we can distinguish more and more deterministic SAOs from pure-noise SAOs near a folded node.
To actually link the results completely, we have to determine the noise level χ, which can be done by evaluating the products σ_{i}F_{i} from (18) at the folded node. We note that the noise terms of system (20) are of the same order as of system (19) since the coordinate transformations involved in obtaining the normal form (see Appendix) are non-singular near the fold. The results are shown in Fig. 9 for parameter values given by (6). Our noise is rather small relative to χ, so we may only expect occasional stochastic deviations from SAOs in the regime far from the singular Hopf bifurcation. However, the time series in Fig. 2 show more irregular behavior, in which the theory does not cover as the SAOs occur near a singular Hopf bifurcation. The discrepancy is particularly apparent in the case when a small deterministically stable limit cycle exists (see Fig. 6). Hence, we conclude that a singular Hopf bifurcation can still produce quite irregular MMOs, even for relatively small noise levels, where a folded node normal form theory would not give an indication for the influence of noise on MMOs. To investigate this effect mathematically remains a formidable challenge for the future work.
APPENDIX: PROOF OF PROPOSITION IV.1
We perform the following series of transformations to arrive at the normal form. We are going to need the following constants to simplify the notation:
The main procedure consists of four main steps.
(1) Translation to the origin: X↦X+x^{⋆},Y↦Y+y^{⋆},Z↦Z+z^{⋆}. The transformed system reads as
where the drift are specified further by the functions
and the diffusion terms are fully defined via the functions
(2) Rectification of the fold curve to the z-axis: X=X̃+c_{11}Z̃,Y=Ỹ+c_{22}Z̃,Z=Z̃, where c_{11} and c_{22} are defined by (A18) and (A19). The transformed system reads as
where
and we also have
with A_{1} defined by (A1), A_{3} by (A5), B_{i} for i = 0, 1, 2 by (A7)–(A9), D_{3} by (A14), and κ by (A17). The functions G_{i}̃ for i = 1, 2, and 3 are positive square roots of Gĩ{2}, where
with D_{0} and E_{0} defined by (A11) and (A16), respectively.
(3) Stretch and translation of the coordinates X̃ and Ỹ:
The transformed system reads as
where
with C defined by (A10), D_{i} by (A11)–(A14), and G_{i}̂ being the positive square root of Gî{2} for i=0,1,2,3.
(4) A final transformation of X̂ and Ŷ: X¯=X̂,Y¯=(1+c_{11}β_{1}x^{⋆}(β_{1}+x^{⋆})Ẑ)Ŷ,Z¯=Ẑ. Carrying out this transformation, dropping the overbars, and denoting the components by (X_{t},Y_{t},Z_{t}), we thus obtain the proposition.
