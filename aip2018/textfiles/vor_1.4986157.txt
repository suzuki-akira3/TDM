Surface acceptor states in MBE-grown CdTe layers
A deep-level hole trap associated with surface defect states has been revealed with deep-level transient spectroscopy investigations of metal-semiconductor junctions fabricated on nitrogen doped p-type CdTe layers grown by the molecular-beam epitaxy technique. The trap displayed the hole-emission activation energy of 0.33 eV and the logarithmic capture kinetics indicating its relation to extended defect states at the metal-semiconductor interface. Strong electric-field-induced enhancement of the thermal emission rate of holes from the trap has been attributed to the phonon-assisted tunneling effect from defect states involving very large lattice relaxation around the defect and metastability of its occupied state. Passivation with ammonium sulfide of the CdTe surface, prior to metallization, results in a significant decrease in the trap density. It also results in a distinct reduction in the width of the surface-acceptor-state-induced hysteresis loops in the capacitance vs. voltage characteristics of the metal-semiconductor junctions.
I. INTRODUCTION
The semiconductor surface plays an important role in the technology of semiconductor devices. The formation of metal-semiconductor contacts, of both the ohmic and Schottky-barrier types, crucially depends on the quality of the semiconductor surface. In particular, surface states, which are created by defects and native oxides, strongly affect the performance of the devices and decide their electrical characteristics.
Cadmium telluride, in view of its direct, well-matched to the solar spectrum, band-gap, high average atomic number, high absorption coefficient, and high intrinsic resistivity, became an attractive material for the fabrication of x- and gamma-ray detectors, high-efficiency solar cells, and nonlinear optical devices [1]. However, the high density of surface states and the large surface recombination velocity of CdTe have been inherent problems in the fabrication of high-efficiency devices [1,2]. In the present paper, we focus our attention on the analysis of surface defect states in p-type CdTe epitaxial layers and the effect of various surface treatments on the electrical properties of metal-semiconductor junctions. The surface states have been investigated by the deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) technique and capacitance vs. voltage (C-V) measurements. Partial results have already been published in conference papers [3,4].
II. SAMPLES AND EXPERIMENTAL METHODS
The investigated nitrogen-doped p-type CdTe layers of 5 μm thickness were grown by the molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) technique, under stoichiometric conditions, on (001)-oriented p^{+}-type, Zn-doped GaAs substrates. Prior to the deposition of CdTe layers, the GaAs substrate was covered with a thin, 3-monolayer-thick, undoped ZnTe layer to reduce the strong lattice mismatch of 14.6% between CdTe and GaAs and to stabilize the growth along the [001] crystallographic direction [5]. Very similar results have been obtained for two investigated CdTe layers, which differed in the nitrogen doping level. The room-temperature hole concentrations in the layers were 9 × 10^{15} cm^{−3} and 2.4 × 10^{16} cm^{−3}, as determined from C-V measurements performed with the use of a 1 MHz Boonton 7200 capacitance meter. DLTS measurements were carried out by means of a lock-in based DLS-82E system (SEMITRAP, Hungary) working at the capacitance testing frequency of 1 MHz.
Both the DLTS and C-V measurements have been performed employing Schottky-barrier diodes obtained by aluminum evaporation onto the p-CdTe surface. Before the metallization, the layer surface was subjected to various treatments: etching in bromine in methanol solutions of different concentrations, from 0.25% to 2%, and passivation by immersing the sample in ammonium sulfide (NH_{4})_{2}S for 2 min. The aluminum layer was covered with gold in order to prevent oxidizing. The diodes exhibited the barrier heights in the range from 0.6 to 0.7 V, as measured from both their C-V and forward-bias current vs. voltage (I-V) characteristics. DLTS measurements have been carried out under the conditions of leakage current density well below 1 × 10^{−4 }A/cm^{2}, i.e., at the diode reverse bias up to –3 V, in order to exclude the impact-ionization-induced enhancement of charge-carrier emission from deep levels [6].
DLTS is a widely used, powerful and well-established method for investigating deep band-gap states in semiconductor materials and structures. It is based on the registration of the capacitance changes of the space-charge layer in a reverse-biased Schottky or p-n junction caused by charge-carriers trapped at band-gap states during the filling voltage pulse [7]. This method provides important information about deep-level defects, such as the activation energy of thermal emission of charge carriers from the defect levels, their capture cross-sections, defect concentrations, and the depth profile of the concentrations. Carrying out our DLTS measurements at various reverse bias voltages V_{R} and filling pulse voltages V_{P} applied to the junction, we were able to determine the region of the space-charge layer of the junction where the revealed defects were located. In addition, measurements of the kinetics for capture of charge carriers into the defect states, as the dependence of the DLTS-signal amplitude on the filling pulse time, enabled us to distinguish isolated point defects from extended defects, such as dislocations and surface or interface states. Moreover, we have taken advantage of the control of electric field existing in the space-charge layer of the reverse-biased junction used for DLTS measurements to examine the field dependence of thermal emission rate of charge carriers from deep-level defects, which provided further characterization of the defects.
III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. DLTS results
DLTS spectra, representative for the two layers, measured under two filling pulse voltages with Schottky diodes prepared on surfaces freshly etched in bromine-methanol, are presented in Fig. 1. Our measurements, performed in the temperature range from 90 K to 400 K, under various bias conditions, have revealed a total of five deep-level hole traps, labeled H1 to H5, as shown in Fig. 1. The thermal emission rates of holes from the traps, e_{p}, as a function of reciprocal temperature (the Arrhenius plots), obtained from temperature dependence of the DLTS spectra measured for various rate windows, are shown in Fig. 2. One of the traps, labeled H5, has been revealed only under the forward-bias filling pulse, i.e., when the investigated space-charge region of the Schottky diode includes the metal-semiconductor interface. This indicates that the H5 trap is associated with electronic states at the CdTe surface. The amplitude of its DLTS peak has been about two orders of magnitude larger than the amplitudes of the other peaks observed in the DLTS spectra, as shown in Fig. 1. The emission activation energy of the H5 trap and its capture cross-section, evaluated from the Arrhenius plot shown in Fig. 2, are 0.33 eV and 3.5 × 10^{−17} cm^{2}, respectively. The origin of other traps present in the CdTe layers below the metal-semiconductor interface has been discussed in our previous papers taking into account both the DLTS and cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results [3,5]. Two of the traps, H2 and H3, have been ascribed to native point defects: the Cd vacancy and a complex formed of Cd vacancy and Te antisite, respectively. Two other traps, H1 and H4, have been assigned to the electronic states of threading dislocations generated at the mismatched interface with the GaAs substrate and propagated through the CdTe layer.
The ascription of the H5 trap to surface defect states has also been confirmed by the fact that we have not observed this trap in the DLTS spectra of MBE-grown, CdTe-based p-n junctions, where the measured space charge region was far from the surface [8]. On the other hand, the presence of a large density of acceptor states at the surface of MBE-grown CdTe layers was previously reported by Maslana et_al [9] Moreover, the hole traps associated with surface states revealed in the DLTS spectra measured for MBE-grown n-type CdTe layers, reported in Ref [10], are probably of the same origin as the H5 trap. Finally, the dependence of DLTS-peak amplitude on the filling pulse time, measured for the H5 trap over four orders of magnitude of that time, was logarithmic, as shown in the inset in Fig. 2, evidencing that the trap is related to electronic states of extended defect. Such logarithmic capture kinetics, caused by the electrostatic interaction between a charge carrier just being captured and other charges already captured at the defect states, is characteristic of extended defects. This interaction results in the formation of a Coulombic barrier around the charged extended defect, whose height increases with the number of charge carriers captured at the defect [11]. In DLTS measurements, it manifests itself as a linear dependence of the signal amplitude on the logarithm of the filling pulse time [12,13], similar to that shown in the inset in Fig. 2. Such dependence was previously observed for both interface defect states and dislocations in various lattice-mismatched semiconductor heterostructures, as, e.g., in Refs [14] and  [15]. In contrast, deep levels associated with non-interacting point defects or impurities exhibit exponential capture kinetics [7].
Spatially extended defects are generally associated with distribution of electronic states, which may form narrow energy bands rather than localized electron states within the band gap. This distribution of electronic states may affect the shape of DLTS peak associated with the extended defects and its dependence on the filling pulse time [16,17]. Moreover, the Arrhenius plots obtained from DLTS results for those defects may depend on the filling pulse time resulting in various emission activation energies revealed from the plots [18]. The Arrhenius plot for the H5 trap shown in Fig. 2 has been obtained from DLTS measurements performed at the filling pulse time of 0.2 ms. Consequently, the emission activation energy of the trap and its capture cross-section, listed above, correspond to this value of the filling pulse time.
B. Effect of electric field
The strong electric field in the space-charge layer of a Schottky or p-n junction may cause an enhancement of thermal emission rate of charge carriers from deep-level defects in the direction of the field. In DLTS measurements, this phenomenon results in a shift of the DLTS peak position towards lower temperatures and a decrease of the apparent activation energy of the corresponding deep level while increasing the electric field. The magnitude of the influence of electric field on the emission rate strongly depends on the shape of the defect potential and on a mechanism responsible for the phenomenon. One can distinguish three mechanisms, which have been proposed to account for it: the classical Poole-Frenkel effect, the phonon-assisted tunneling, and the direct tunneling [19]. However, the latter mechanism, which becomes efficient only at very high electric fields of the order of 10^{7} V cm^{−1}, is rather unlikely to occur under the conditions of conventional DLTS experiments.
An impact of electric field on the DLTS-peak position of the H5 trap has been revealed in the DLTS measurements performed at a fixed emission rate window and different reverse bias voltages, as shown in Fig. 3. A distinct shift of the H5 peak towards lower temperature with increasing electric field intensity at the metal-semiconductor interface, whose values calculated from the reverse bias voltages are written in the figure, evidences the field-induced enhancement of thermal emission rate of holes from the H5 trap. The electric-field dependences of hole-emission rates from the trap have been obtained for various temperatures from the DLTS spectra recorded at three emission rate windows for each of the chosen electric-field intensity. The revealed emission rates from the traps e_{p}(F), plotted as a function of square of the electric-field intensity F, are presented in Fig. 4. The results follow the relation ln[e_{p}(F)] ∝ F^{2} over the whole range of available electric-field intensity, showing a strong enhancement of the hole emission rate by over two orders of magnitude for the twofold increase in the electric-field intensity.
The Poole-Frenkel effect describes the increase in the ionization probability of charged traps in an external electric field as a result of the lowering of the barrier associated with their Coulomb potential. According to the one-dimensional Poole-Frenkel mechanism, the charge-carrier thermal emission rate from a singly ionized trap with the attractive Coulomb potential increases exponentially with the square root of the electric-field intensity [20]. Thus, the Poole-Frenkel mechanism is rather insufficient to account for much stronger electric-field dependence revealed for the H5 trap and shown in Fig. 4.
The second proposed mechanism, the phonon-assisted tunneling, which consists in charge-carrier tunneling through a potential barrier of deep-level defect while exploiting the lattice vibrational energy with the use of a multiphonon process [21], involves the efficient interaction of the bound charge carrier with a local phonon mode. Theoretically, that mechanism was examined in the strictly quantum-mechanical approach by Makram-Ebeid and Lannoo [22], which was further developed by Schenk [23] who made several simplifying approximations in order to facilitate computations. Fleming et_al [24] adapted the latter theory for calculating the field-dependent emission rates from deep-level defects in GaAs. On the other hand, Karpus and Perel [25] proposed the semi-classical theory of the phonon-assisted tunneling mechanism resulting in a simple analytical expression for the field-dependent emission rate, which can be written as [26]
where e(0) is the emission rate at the zero electric field, Fc2=3m^{*}ℏ/τ23q^{2} is the square of characteristic field intensity, m* is the effective mass of charge carriers, ℏ is the Planck constant divided by 2π, q is the elementary charge, and τ_{2} is the tunneling time. Equation (1) provides for the exponential increase in the charge-carrier thermal emission rate from a deep-level defect with the square of the electric-field intensity, similar to those shown in Fig. 4 for the H5 trap.
In the adiabatic approximation of the semi-classical theory by Karpus and Perel, developed by Ganichev et_al [27,28], the tunneling time assumes the following form:
where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and τ_{1} is the time constant, which is on the order of the inverse local defect vibration frequency and determines the strength of coupling of the defect to the lattice vibronic modes in the sense that the stronger coupling results in the smaller τ_{1} value [28]. The plus and minus signs in Eq. (2) correspond to the adiabatic potential structure of the defect of the on-site type (moderate lattice relaxation caused by a charge carrier capture) and autolocalized type (very large lattice relaxation resulting in a metastable behavior of the occupied defect), respectively.
Fitting Eq. (1) to the experimental results for various temperatures, shown with the dashed lines in Fig. 4, testifies to the phonon-assisted tunneling as the mechanism responsible for the field-induced enhancement of hole emission rate from the H5 trap. The tunneling times τ_{2}, determined from the fitting, are plotted as a function of inverse temperature in the inset in Fig. 4. Fitting Eq. (2) to the τ_{2} values needs an additional fitting parameter α (of the order of one) [29] and the minus sign in Eq. (2), which can be written as follows:
implying an autolocalized type of the adiabatic potential structure of the defect responsible for the H5 trap, with very large lattice relaxation around the defect and a metastable behavior of the occupied defect state. Best fitting Eq. (3) to the temperature dependence of the tunneling times τ_{2}, shown with the dashed line in the inset in Fig. 4, gives the τ_{1} value of 1.0 × 10^{−14 }s. This, rather small value of τ_{1} time constant, which indicates a strong coupling of the defect to the lattice vibronic modes, is of the same order of magnitude as the one obtained for the DX defect, displaying metastable behavior, in Te-doped n-type AlGaAs ternary compound [26]. On the other hand, three to eight times larger τ_{1} values were obtained for deep-level traps associated with defects displaying the on-site type adiabatic potential structure, such as the double donor level of the EL2 defect in p-type GaAs [30], vacancy-oxygen complex in n-type Ge [31], and substitutional Au and Hg impurities in p-type Ge [32].
C. C-V characterization and effect of surface passivation
Charge carriers trapped at the metal-semiconductor interface strongly affect the C-V characteristics of metal-semiconductor junctions. In particular, minority carriers trapped at slow surface states may result in the appearance of hysteresis loops during the measurements of C-V characteristics [33]. This type of C-V curves, characteristic of the presence of slow surface states, is shown in Fig. 5 (left panel) where arrows indicate the direction of hysteresis loop measurement. When the measurement is carried out starting from the reverse-bias voltage, the capacitance value is larger than that obtained while measured in the opposite direction. Under reverse-bias voltage, surface defect states are located below the Fermi level and become filled with electrons, as shown schematically in Fig. 5 (right panel). Trapping the minority charge carriers (electrons in our case) at those states increases the electric charge of the space charge region and enhances junction capacitance. The shape of the hysteresis loop shown in Fig. 5 suggests that trapping the minority charge carriers is faster than their emission from the surface states. This interpretation of the measured C-V hysteresis loops indicates that the surface states are of acceptor type, which is consistent with the results obtained by Maslana et_al [9]
The bromine-methanol solution is most widely used for etching the CdTe surface to remove the oxides prior to metallization. However, during the etching, the Cd^{2+} ions partially dissolve into the solution forming CdBr_{2}. The remaining Te^{2–} ions are reduced producing the dangling Te^{0} bonds at the surface [34,35], which give rise to the surface electron states [35]. Passivation of the CdTe surface with ammonium sulfide dissociates effectively the remaining oxides from the surface and saturates the dangling bonds at the surface resulting in the formation of CdS and CdTe_{1-x}S_{x}, which protect the surface from re-oxidation [36]. Kang et_al [36] determined that for passivation of the p-CdTe surface, the optimal duration of ammonium sulfide treatment was 2 min.
Figure 6 shows the C-V characteristics of p-CdTe with Al contacts deposited on the surface freshly etched in the 0.25% bromine-methanol solution for 5 s [Fig. 6(a)] and on the similarly etched surface and passivated in ammonium sulfide for 2 min [Fig. 6(b)]. The width of hysteresis loop, caused by slow surface acceptor states, decreased as a result of the surface passivation in ammonium sulfide, suggesting a significant decrease in the density of surface states.
A similar effect was observed in the DLTS measurements shown in Fig. 7. As a result of the passivation, the H5 DLTS peak associated with surface defect sates significantly decreased its amplitude and slightly shifted towards lower temperature (labeled H5′ in the spectrum (b) in Fig. 7). The trap concentration per area unit of the surface, estimated from the DLTS peak amplitudes measured at the longest filling pulse time of 20 ms, dropped from about 5.1 × 10^{13} cm^{−2} to 7.7 × 10^{12} cm^{−2}, confirming that the same trap is likely responsible for hysteresis loops revealed in the C-V characteristics of the investigated Schottky junctions. The peak at about 250 K in Fig. 7 is likely related to the H3 trap, which is more pronounced in the spectrum (a) in Fig. 1, measured under different bias conditions. The shift of the H5′ peak position in the DLTS spectrum, and the corresponding decrease in its emission activation energy to 0.25 eV, obtained from the Arrhenius plot shown in the inset in Fig. 7, is tentatively interpreted as a result of changes in surroundings of the surface defects induced by the passivation. Nevertheless, the H5′ trap still exhibits the logarithmic capture kinetics, confirming its association with extended defect states at the surface. Very large lattice relaxation, resulting in a metastable behavior of the occupied H5 trap, additionally testifies for the H5 trap activity as slow surface states.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
A deep-level trap, labeled H5, associated with surface defect states in nitrogen doped p-type CdTe layers grown by the MBE technique has been revealed in DLTS investigations of Schottky junctions fabricated on the layer surfaces. The trap, with a large density of above 10^{13} cm^{−2}, displayed the logarithmic capture kinetics indicating its association with extended defect states at the surface. Moreover, the trap displayed strong dependence of its DLTS-peak position in the spectra, and the apparent emission activation energy, on the electric field. The measurements of the electric-field dependence of hole emission rate from the trap, performed at various temperatures, allowed for determination of the mechanism responsible for the field-induced enhancement of hole emission rate from the trap as the phonon-assisted tunneling effect. Fitting the experimental results to the adiabatic approximation of semi-classical theory of that mechanism suggests an autolocalized type of the potential structure of the defect responsible for the trap. The low value of the tunneling time constant τ_{1} (1.0 × 10^{−14 }s) indicates a strong coupling of the defect to the lattice vibronic modes.
The presence of surface defect states in p-type CdTe layers has also been confirmed by capacitance-voltage measurements, revealing hysteresis effects in the C-V characteristics of the Schottky junctions. The direction of the C-V hysteresis loops indicates acceptor behavior of the states. The slow surface states causing the formation of hysteresis loops in the C-V characteristics are most likely the same as the H5 trap exhibiting very large lattice relaxation and metastability of the occupied defect state. Passivation of the p-CdTe surface with ammonium sulfide, prior to metallization, results in a distinct decrease in the width of the hysteresis loops in C-V characteristics, testifying for the reduction of the density of the slow surface defect states. On the other hand, the same passivation leads also to a significant decrease in the amplitude of the H5 DLTS peak as a result of a decrease in the H5 trap density by almost one order of magnitude.
