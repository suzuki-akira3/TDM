Electrochemical reactor based on a polymer electrolyte fuel cell for the reduction reaction of CO_{2}
The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency is now developing life support systems for closed environments in space. The reduction reaction of carbon dioxide is an important technique for the sustainable manned operation in space. Recently, Umeda et al. [J. Appl. Phys. 114, 174908 (2013)] from the Nagaoka University of Technology reported that the reduction reaction of carbon dioxide (CO_{2}) proceeded using a fuel cell under the existence of CO_{2} and H_{2} by supplying those gases to the cathode and the anode, respectively. We observed stable reaction when Pt/Ru-C was used as a catalyst for the cathode and Pt-C for the anode. Different organic materials were obtained depending on the alternated potential and temperature. Furthermore, a fuel cell stack with 8 cells connected in series was tested to demonstrate the stable energy generation by feeding CO_{2} to the cathode and H_{2} to the anode.
I. INTRODUCTION
The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has been developing technology for life support systems accompanied by energy and environmental management devices for closed environments like the space station.
For manned missions in space, the management of the resources for the life support is very important. All consumption articles like cloth, food, and water are always carried from Earth by Space Shuttles and other cargo missions like HTV (H-II Transfer Vehicle of JAXA) and ATV [Automated Transfer Vehicle of European Space Agency (ESA)]. The waste from the human activity was stored and then burned out during the Earth reentry phase of the cargo missions. Carbon dioxide (CO_{2}) was conventionally absorbed using Li-OH pellets and also burned out like other wastes. Recently, zeolites started to be used to absorb CO_{2}. Multiple cabinets of zeolite are used to absorb CO_{2}, and CO_{2} is released from the cabinets sequentially to the space using heat when needed. Oxygen (O_{2}) is not only carried by the cargo but also generated using electrolyzers. Human urine is purified and fresh water is prepared in space, today.
As it is mentioned, revitalization of the material becomes more important in order to stay for longer periods in space. The reduction of CO_{2} by hydrogen (H_{2}) to generate water is focused as the revitalization of water and oxygen. The Sabatier reaction is used for the reduction reaction of CO_{2} [1–5]. In the case of terrestrial applications, methane (CH_{4}) is useful as an energy carrier and has received a lot of attention for the practical application in the generation of renewable energy. In the case of space applications, the water generated from the reaction can be used as drinking water and is also available for water electrolysis to generate O_{2} [6,7].
Space agencies like NASA and JAXA are making a lot of efforts to enhance the performance of the Sabatier reaction [8–11]. One of the major efforts focus on decreasing the temperature for the reaction. The Sabatier reaction is an exothermic reaction which usually reaches the equilibrium above 350 °C. Furthermore, the efficiency of the reduction of CO_{2} is degraded above 300 °C, and the degradation of the catalyst proceeds at higher temperature. Thus, the decrease in the temperature for the reaction is always needed. Recently, the University of Toyama and JAXA developed a catalyst attached on the surface of TiO_{2} [9–11]. This catalyst enables the Sabatier reaction to proceed at around 250 °C. The University of Toyama and JAXA are making further efforts to develop a catalyst for the Sabatier reaction at even lower temperatures.
The Sabatier reaction is an exothermic reaction which has potential to generate energy. Very recently, Umeda et_al from the Nagaoka University of Technology (NUT) found that a reactor composed of a fuel cell, where CO_{2} and H_{2} are supplied, generated electricity [12–14]. They also detected methane (CH_{4}) and other organic compounds inside the outlet gases from the cathode [12–14]. Based on the reaction, NUT and JAXA started a collaboration for the electrochemical reduction reaction between CO_{2} and H_{2}.
In this paper, the electrochemical reaction between CO_{2} and H_{2} using a polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) as a reactor is reported accompanied by the stable operability of the reactor.
II. EXPERIMENTAL
A. Experimental procedure to ensure the electrochemical reaction
The baseline condition to prepare the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) is as follows: Pt-Ru/C is used for the cathode catalyst, and Pt-C is used for the anode. Two Pt-Ru/C catalysts with the same composition of Pt:Ru-1:1 but with different alloy formation were used. The catalysts are named as alloy 1 and alloy 2. Two MEA were prepared using 1 mg/cm^{2} of alloy 1 and 3 mg/cm^{2} of alloy 2, respectively, while 1 mg/cm^{2} Pt-C was always used for the anode side. These catalysts were sprayed on a carbon paper which was used as the gas diffusion layer. The surface area of the carbon paper attached to the membrane was 2.5 cm × 2.5 cm. NAFION 117^{®} was used as a proton conducting membrane. The gas diffusion layer with the catalyst and the membrane was pressed at 148 °C under 2 kN for 15 min, and the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) was prepared.
For the precise detection of the products, a single-cell-reactor based on the polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) was prepared. A schematic illustration of the reactor is shown in Fig. 1. Like PEFC, a carbon separator with a single gas flow channel was used in which the gasses like CO_{2} and H_{2} were fully humidified at the operation temperature and then supplied with the gas-flow-rate of 50 ml/min. In order to eliminate any contamination, CO_{2} with the purity of 99.995% and H_{2} with the purity of 99.999% were supplied for the demonstration of the reactor operability. The operation temperature of the reactor was alternated between 40 and 80 °C. Different types of Pt-Ru/C were tested to clarify the electrochemical reaction between CO_{2} and H_{2}.
The out-let gas line from the reactor was sealed and connected to a GC/mass spectrometer, “GCMS-QP2010 Ultra of SHIMAZU co. ltd.” A column, “CP Pora PLOT,” was used to detect the products. Helium (He) with a purity of 99.9999% was used as the carrier gas with the flow rate of 3.62 × 10^{−3} m^{3}/min.
B. Demonstration for the continuous operation of the CO_{2}/H_{2} reactor
An eight-cell-stack reactor was prepared in order to demonstrate the stability of the reaction. The reaction between CO_{2} and H_{2} seemed to be similar to the direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC), and thus, the stack originally designed for the DMFC by Chemix co. ltd. was used for the demonstration as the energy generator based CO_{2} and H_{2}. As originally designed for the DMFC, 1.0 mg/cm^{2} Pt-Ru black and 6.0 mg/cm^{2} Pt black were used for the cathode and anode catalyst, respectively. The surface area of the catalyst that came into contact with the membrane was 30 cm^{2}. The flow rate of the supplied gas was 5.0 × 10^{−4} m^{3}/min, and the temperature was controlled at 80 °C during the operation. CO_{2} with a purity of 99.995% and H_{2} with a purity of 99.999% were supplied for the demonstration of the operability of the reactor.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Selectivity of the products
Figure 2 shows a typical spectrum obtained from the GC-MS observation of the electrochemical reactor using the alloy 1 catalyst. The out-let gas line from the reactor was connected and sealed to the GC-mass spectrometer. CO_{2} with a purity of 99.995% and H_{2} with a purity of 99.999% were supplied to the reactor so that the contamination inside the reactant gassed should be negligible. The temperature of the stack was maintained at 80 °C during the experiment. As it is shown in the figure, methane (CH_{4}) was the only hydrocarbon detected; methanol (CH_{3}OH) and ethanol (C_{2}H_{5}OH) were the only detected alcohol products from the reaction. Since humidified CO_{2} and H_{2} were supplied to the reactor, H_{2}O could be detected, and the GC/mass spectrometer was to set to avoid the H_{2}O retention time due to the fact that its intensity can affect the detection of the products during the electrochemical reaction.
Figure 3 shows the amount of products detected from the out-let gas on the cathode side. The reactor was operated at 80 °C, and the amount of catalyst for the cathode was 1 mg/cm^{2}. At higher potential, alcohols such as methanol and ethanol were detected, while methane was observed at lower potential. A clear dependency of the products on the potential was observed, which suggested that the reaction should be dominated by the electrochemical process. The amount of methane decreases by increasing the cell potential, while the amount of methanol and ethanol increases with the potential. This is because the reduction reaction takes place at low potentials. On the other hand, the oxidation process occurs at high potentials, which decreases the methane generation and produces intermediates that favor the generation of alcohols. This suggests that the controlled selection of the products might be possible depending on the potential.
During these operations, a noisy current was always observed as shown in Fig. 4, which shows a chronoamperogram measured at 60 mV. This noisy behavior seems to be related to adsorption and desorption of the CO_{2} reduction products. When the current decreases, the catalyst is being poisoned by the adsorption of the products, and when the products are desorbed, the active sites of the catalyst are recovered, which results in the increase in the current. Therefore, this noisy behavior of the current could be the reason for the fluctuation in the product yield, which is observed in the low potential range shown in Fig. 3.
Figure 5 shows the products produced by the reaction using a different catalyst, Pt-Ru/C alloy 2, where the only difference between the two catalysts was the condition of alloy formation. The ratio between Pt and Ru was the same as that in the case of Fig. 3. A larger amount of methane was also detected at lower potential, while a larger amount of alcohol was detected at higher potential. The typical feature of the reaction was the amount of ethanol. As shown in Fig. 5, a trace amount of ethanol was detected in all regions of potential. This figure suggests that the selection of a proper catalyst has an effect on the selectivity of the products.
From the results shown in Figs. 3 and 5, it is observed that the electrochemical reduction of CO_{2} takes place at more positive potential than the standard electrode potential [15]. This is due to the fact that the intermediates generated during the reduction of CO_{2} are adsorbed on the electrode surface, and this results in an increase in the reduction potential.
B. Demonstration of the continuous operation of the CO_{2}/H_{2} reactor
A fuel cell stack was applied to demonstrate the stability of the reaction. The stack was originally designed to generate 150 W-class-electricity by H_{2} and O_{2}. The catalyst area for the cell was 30 cm^{2}, and 8 cells were stacked in series. The catalyst for the cathode was Pt-Ru black, while Pt black was used for the anode. Nominally, the operation temperature of the stack was 80 °C.
Figure 6 shows the I-V curves during the generation of electricity. CO_{2} and H_{2} supplied to the stack had a purity of 99.995% and 99.999%, respectively. The open circuit voltage (OCV) appeared around 100 mV/cell (vs. CE), and each cell showed identical performance for energy generation.
Figure 7 shows the continuous operation of the stack. Initially, 1.0 A was drawn from the stack, and the cells maintained the output voltage at 50 mV. After the operation for four hours, the current was increased up to 2.0 A. The cell voltage dropped down to 25 mV but still maintained the stability for energy generation.
After the operation, we measured the basic characteristics of the stack. Figure 8 shows the relationships between the current density and the generated power. The potential and power generated from the same current density degraded after the continuous operation of the stack. The reduction reaction of CO_{2} might produce toxic materials to the catalysts like CO as intermediates on the surface of the catalyst. The degraded performance of the stack should be due to the existence of those materials covering the catalysts during the durability test of the stack.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
An electrochemical reactor for the reduction of CO_{2} by H_{2} based on the PEFC was prepared. CH_{4}, CH_{3}OH, and C_{2}H_{5}OH were produced by the reaction. The amount of CH_{4} was larger in a low potential region, while the amount of alcohols increased at high potential. The dependency suggested that the selection of the products should be possible using the reactor.
Continuous operability was also demonstrated. An eight-cell-stack PEFC was prepared, and the generation of electricity was continuously demonstrated for 5 h. We observed almost constant potential throughout the measurement. After the 5-h-operation, the relationship between the power and the current density was measured. It showed slight degradation of the power generation, but the stack maintained an appropriate performance.
Therefore, the future applicability of the electrochemical reduction reaction of CO_{2} by H_{2} could be demonstrated.
