In situ imaging of the soldering reactions in nanoscale Cu/Sn/Cu and Sn/Cu/Sn diffusion couples
The soldering reactions of three-segmented Sn/Cu/Sn and Cu/Sn/Cu diffusion couples are monitored by in-situ transmission electron microscopy to reveal the metallurgical reaction mechanism and the associated phase transformation pathway. For Sn/Cu/Sn diffusion couples, there is no ε-Cu_{3}Sn formation due to the relatively insufficient Cu as compared to Sn. Kirkendall voids form initially in the Cu segment and then disappear due to the volume expansion associated with the continued intermetallic compound (IMC) formation as the reaction progresses. The incoming Sn atoms react with Cu to form η-Cu_{6}Sn_{5}, and the continuous reaction then transforms the entire nanowire to η-Cu_{6}Sn_{5} grains with remaining Sn. With continued heating slightly above the melting point of Sn, an Sn-rich liquid phase forms between η-Cu_{6}Sn_{5} grains. By contrast, the reaction in the Cu/Sn/Cu diffusion couples results in the intermetallic phases of both Cu_{3}Sn and Cu_{6}Sn_{5} and the development of Cu_{6}Sn_{5} bulges on Cu_{3}Sn grains. Kirkendall voids form in the two Cu segments, which grow and eventually break the nanowire into multiple segments.
I. INTRODUCTION
In the trend towards greater integration, higher performance, and further miniaturization of electronic devices, there is an increasing need to develop and investigate interconnection materials on the sub-micrometer or nanometer scale [1]. Solders are extensively used in a wide range of electronic systems to form reliable joints between electronic components [2]. Extending the use of conventional solders to the nanoscale is promising. Nanowires are one of the most studied one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures, as they can function as basic electronic circuit elements [3–5] or be assembled and integrated into 1D, 2D, or 3D functional structures. As a result, they have a great potential in applications such as electronics, sensors, and biomedical devices [2,5–9]. The efficient and robust creation of nanowires with functional nanocomponents and nanosolder segments could serve as a basic building block for nanoelectronic integration [10–12]. Nanoscale solders can be electrodeposited on metallic nanowires grown in nanoporous membranes [13–16]. Upton heating, the metallurgical reaction between the solder wire segment and the metallic wire segment results in the formation of intermetallic compounds (IMCs) that serve as the mechanical bonding between the solder segment and the functional element (i.e., metal base segment) [2].
Soldering is a well-recognized metallurgical joining method for bonding a solder to a base metal. Interfacial reactions at the solder joints are key reliability factors in the fabrication of electronic products. Typically, a thin and uniform IMC layer is required for good bonding. A thick IMC layer between the solder and base metal may degrade the reliability of the solder joints because of the inherent brittle nature and the tendency to generate structural defects and stresses caused by the structure and property (e.g., elastic modulus, thermal expansion) mismatches between the IMC and base metal [17,18]. Therefore, a deep fundamental understanding of the interfacial reactions at the solder joints and phase evolution in the solder interconnections is essential to developing reliable solder interconnections [19–22].
The Cu–Sn system is one of the widely used metallurgical systems for system integration and electronic packaging because of its easy formation of Cu–Sn IMCs that serve as the mechanical bonding between the Sn-based solder and the copper pad of a printed circuit board. The solid-state growth of Cu-Sn IMCs in the form of bulk materials has been studied extensively. The miniaturization of electronic devices into the nanometer scale requires efficient and effective methods for joining and interconnecting individual nanostructured units [6,23]. A fundamental understanding of the interfacial reactions including wetting, dissolution, and reactive phase formation between the nanosolder and functional nano-components is still very limited.
Recently, the interfacial reaction and associated phase evolution in two-segment Cu-Sn nanowires has been studied [24,25]. However, in real application it is more often that the solder element is sandwiched between two base metals (Cu/Sn/Cu) or the substrate being placed between two solder particles (Sn/Cu/Sn) [3,26–28]. For the case of the Cu/Sn/Cu configuration, Sn diffuses toward the two Cu segments at each side and Cu diffuses into the Sn segment in between. For the case of the Sn/Cu/Sn configuration, Cu diffuses out towards to the two Sn segments at each side and reacts with incoming diffusing Sn from both sides during the soldering reaction. Thus, the difference in symmetry as compared to the two-segmented Cu/Sn system raises fundamental interests of understanding the soldering reaction such as the interdiffusion void growth and IMC formation in the three-segmented Cu/Sn/Cn and Sn/Cu/Sn nanowires. In this study, the soldering reaction of a segment of pure Sn sandwiched between two segments of the Cu base metal as well as a segment of Cu base metal sandwiched between two segments of Sn is comparatively investigated by in-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Our results demonstrate that the interface reaction at the solder joints depends on the configuration of the sandwiched structures and differs significantly in the key features of the soldering reactions in the Sn/Cu/Sn and Cu/Sn/Cu nanowires including IMC formation, microstructure evolution, and growth of Kirkendall voids.
II. EXPERIMENTAL
The Cu-Sn-Cu and Sn-Cu-Sn three-segmented nanowires were fabricated by room-temperature sequential electrodeposition assisted with polycarbonate nanoporous membrane templates (Whatman). Cu was deposited using a commercial Cu plating electrolyte (Cu U-bath RTU, Technic, Inc.) with the current controlled at 2 mA/cm^{2}. The Sn layer was electroplated by a commercial Sn plating electrolyte (Sn concentrate with make-up solutions, Technic, Inc.) with the current controlled at 18 mA/cm^{2}. After the electroplating, the polycarbonate membrane was dissolved in dichloromethane to release the nanowires into the solvent. Details of the synthesis of the nanosolders can be found from previous work [13,14,25]. The as-prepared segmented nanowires were kept as a suspension in ethanol. TEM samples were prepared by the powder sample preparation method with ultrasonic dispersion followed with drop casting onto a lacey carbon film supported by a Mo grid, which was then mounted onto a Gatan heating holder with rapid heating capability using a Gatan hot-stage temperature controller. In-situ TEM and scanning TEM (STEM) observations of the metallurgical reaction in the three-segment nanowires were performed using a JEOL JEM2100F operated at 200 kV equipped with an x-ray energy dispersive spectrometer (XEDS) (Oxford Energy TEM 250).
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Cu and Sn segments are sequentially electrodeposited in the form of nanowires for studying the metallurgical reaction with Sn as the soldering material between two Cu segments or one Cu segment between two sections of the soldering element. Figure 1(a) shows a backscattered scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the as-synthesized Sn-Cu-Sn nanowires and the inset is a magnified SEM image of a single nanowire. Because Sn has a larger atomic number than Cu, the bright segment at the right end corresponds to the Sn segment, the slightly darker region in the middle is the Cu segment, and the brighter segment on the left corresponds to the Sn segment. These nanowires were fabricated by electroplating with the commercially available nanoporous templates. These templates are not electrical conductive materials. To enable the electroplating reaction, an electrically conductive silver layer was evaporated to cover the surface of the nanopores and the bottom side of the template also has to be sealed by an electrically conductive layer. This led to the formation of a smaller size of nanopores at the bottom side than at the top side of the template. The inhomogeneous template pore size resulted in fabricated nanowires with one end coarser than the other. The coarse and fine ends of the nanowires cause a difference in the SEM image contrast. The contrast of backscattered scanning electron images comes from the ability of the atoms to reflect and scatter the incident electrons. The coarse ends have more electrons that are backscattered into the SEM detector as compared to the fine ends of the nanowire. Therefore, the coarse end appears brighter than the fine end in the SEM image. Figure 1(b) shows a STEM dark field image of an as-synthesized Sn-Cu-Sn three-segmented nanowire. The corresponding EDS Cu and Sn elemental maps of the nanowire are shown in Figs. 1(c) and 1(d), from which the Cu and Sn segments can be easily identified. Figure 1(e) shows a backscattered SEM image of the as-synthesized Cu-Sn-Cu three-segmented nanowires; the inset is a magnified SEM image of the nanowires, which shows a strong contrast for the Sn segment in the middle while a slightly weaker contrast for the two Cu segments at each side. Figure 1(f) shows a STEM bright field image of an as-synthesized Cu-Sn-Cu three-segmented nanowire. The corresponding EDS elemental mapping is shown in Figs. 1(g) and 1(h), from which it is easy to identify the two Cu segments and the Sn segment in between. Our TEM examination shows that the three-segment Cu-Sn-Cu and Sn-Cu-Sn nanowires fabricated by electrodeposition do not have any specific crystal orientation preference. From the elemental mapping of the as-prepared nanowires shown in Figs. 1(c), 1(d), and 1(g) and 1(h), we can see the Cu/Sn interfaces for both Cu-Sn-Cu and Sn-Cu-Sn nanowires are all inclined. The tilt angle of the interfaces can be different for different nanowires.
To investigate the IMC formation along with the Kirkendall void growth during the soldering reaction, a single nanowire is used for in-situ heating TEM observations. Figure 2 shows the morphological evolution of a Sn-Cu-Sn nanowire while it is being heated from room temperature (RT) to 236.5 °C. The dashed lines in Fig. 2 denote the original interface regions between the Cu segment and the two Sn segments at each side, as known from the STEM EDS Cu and Sn maps of this nanowire shown in Figs. 1(c) and 1(d), with the Cu segment in the middle of the nanowire between the two segments of Sn on the left and right side. The Sn segment on the left has a larger diameter as compared to the one on the right. The nanowire has no obvious changes until it is being heated to ∼174.4 °C, at which a void appears in the Cu segment. This void grows as the temperature increases, as shown in the TEM images at 198.1 °C, 204.4 °C, and 205.7 °C, respectively. The Cu_{6}Cu_{5} formation during the heating process transforms the two original Cu/Sn interfaces to two Cu_{6}Sn_{5}/Cu interfaces that propagate toward the Cu segment in the middle and the two Cu_{6}Sn_{5}/Sn interfaces that move to the two Sn segments with the continued IMC growth. The void shown in Fig. 2 is actually close to the Cu_{6}Sn_{5}/Cu interface on the right. The close proximity of the Kirkendall voids with the IMC/Cu interface is confirmed by both the composition measurement with EDS and structure analysis with electron diffraction. The Kirkendall void formation in the Cu segment is due to the mass loss because the diffusion of Cu atoms out of the segment is faster than the diffusion of Sn atoms into the Cu region. With continued heating and increase of temperature, the void shrinks and shifts to the left, as indicated in the TEM images at 206.3 °C. The intermetallic reaction and IMC formation in the Cu segment leads to substantial volume expansion due to the molar volume difference between the reaction product and the parent metal (ΔV = V(Cu_{6}Sn_{5}) – 6 V(Cu) = 75.4 cm^{3}/mol). In Sn-Cu-Sn three-segmented nanowires, Cu diffuses out of the segment towards the two neighboring Sn segments. The faster outward diffusion of Cu than the inwards diffusion of Sn favors the void formation in the Cu segment away from the IMC/Cu interface. As shown in the TEM image of the nanowire at 206.6 °C in Fig. 2, the local area around the void appears brighter as compared to other areas, suggesting that Cu is gradually depleted from this region. In addition, the in-situ TEM images in Fig. 2 show that the voids in the Cu segment migrate away from the IMC/Cu interface, which is in the opposite direction from the diffusion of Cu atoms to the IMC/Cu interface for the IMC growth, further supporting the diffusion induced mass loss for voiding in the Cu segment.
The incoming Sn atoms from the two Sn segments allow for continued Cu_{6}Sn_{5} growth by reacting with the remaining Cu in this region, and the resulting volume expansion associated with the IMC formation gradually refills the void. As shown in the time-sequence TEM images obtained from the nanowire at 206.6 °C for 108 s, 150 s, 181 s, and 289 s in Fig. 2, the continued IMC growth leads to void shrinkage and eventual disappearance. With further heating and increased temperature above 206.6 °C, there are no noticeable changes for the nanowire. The temperature is then further increased above the melting point of Sn to investigate how Cu_{6}Sn_{5} may interact with remnant Sn at an elevated temperature. At 236.5 °C and above, Sn melts as known from the electron diffraction taken from the Sn segment. It should be noted that there is no solid Cu/liquid Sn contact involved because the temperature is increased gradually and slowly and the temperatures and the isothermal holding time intervals at each temperature are given in Fig. 2. Therefore, the intermetallic reaction occurs way before reaching the melting point of Sn. All the soldering reaction and the associated bulging and Kirkendall voiding shown in Fig. 2 occur in the solid state until the temperature reaches 236 °C.
Figures 3(a)–3(d) show the TEM image and the corresponding EDS Cu and Sn elemental maps of the reacted nanowire shown in Fig. 2 with the temperature held at 236.5 °C. It can be seen that Sn distributes along the whole nanowire while Cu diffuses and reaches to the left end of the nanowire. There is remnant Sn left at the right end of the nanowire. To gain more quantitative information about the chemical composition, the EDS linescan along the length direction of the reacted nanowire is acquired from the nanowire with its temperature held at 236.5 °C. The plotted Cu and Sn concentration profiles obtained from the EDS linescan are shown in Fig. 3(d). The EDS elemental mapping and line scan shown in Fig. 3 were taken from the molten Sn at the elevated temperature. Figures 3(b)–3(d) correspond to the state when Sn just reached the molten state. As known from the concentration profile along the length direction of the wire at 236.5 °C [Fig. 3(d)], the segment from x_{2} to the right end of the nanowire still remains as pure Sn after reaching the liquid state. With the prolonged heating and temperature ramping to 299 °C, the length of the remnant Sn segment increased slightly, as indicated by the slight left shift of position x_{6} in Fig. 3(e) relative to x_{2} in Fig. 3(d), indicating that some IMC adjacent to the molten Sn was dissolved into the molten Sn at the IMC/Sn interface during the heating process. Near the left end, there is a segment rich in Sn which ranges from the most left end (x = 0) to the position as indicated by the dashed line x_{1}. This Sn rich region is probably the Sn rich liquid phase at the temperature of 236.5 °C [29,30]. Following the Sn rich segment, the composition features a plateau with Cu slightly over 50 at. %. It corresponds to the η-Cu_{6}Sn_{5} intermetallic phase as identified by the electron diffraction shown later in Fig. 4. The concentration line scan profile acquired at 236.5 °C as indicated in Fig. 3(d) shows that the intermetallic phase formed is Cu_{6}Sn_{5}, which leads to the volume expansion and bulging. Therefore, the void formation in the Cu segment rather than in the Cu_{6}Sn_{5} segment (Fig. 2) must be due to the fast outward-diffusion of Cu, which results in the mass depletion in the local region of the Cu segment. In other words, the void formation in the Cu segment is induced by the faster outward diffusion of Cu than the inward-diffusion of Sn. Such Kirkendall voiding in the Cu segment has been repeatedly observed from in-situ TEM experiments [24,25,31]. The resulting η-Cu_{6}Sn_{5} segment ranges from position x_{1} to x_{2} as marked by the dashed lines in Fig. 3(d). From x_{2} to the right end of the nanowire (x = 3.88 μm), it is mostly Sn with approximately 10 at. % Cu. At this temperature, Sn is in a molten state as identified by the electron diffraction shown later in Fig. 4. Liquid Sn can dissolve slightly Cu in the IMC at the molten Sn/Cu_{6}Sn_{5} interface, as evidenced by the slight shift of the Sn/Cu_{6}Sn_{5} interface toward the right end by comparing Figs. 3(d) and 3(e). This is also consistent with the Cu-Sn phase diagram [32]. Figure 3 also shows that there are no further intermetallic reactions at the temperatures (236.5 °C and 299 °C) above the melting point of Sn because Cu was completely consumed at the lower temperature shown in Fig. 2.
Cu diffuses towards both the coarse and thin ends of the nanowires for the reacted Sn-Cu-Sn couples although it indeed appears (Fig. 3) that Cu diffuses to reach the coarse end of the nanowire while the thin end remains nearly pure Sn. It should be noted that the Sn segment on the right is a lot longer than the Sn segment on the left before heating (shown in Fig. 2). Due to the one-dimensional confined geometry of the nanowire, the diffusion direction of Cu and Sn atoms is largely confined along the length direction of the nanowire and we have to take account of the diffusion distance in order to reach to the two ends of the nanowire. We can take the initial Sn/Cu interface as the diffusion front of Cu to begin with, the diffusion distance for Cu to reach the coarse end of the nanowire is the length of the Sn segment on the left and the diffusion distance for Cu to reach the fine end of the nanowire equals the length of the Sn segment on the right side (see Fig. 2, RT). A larger distance requires longer time for atoms to diffuse through with the same diffusion rate (at a constant temperature). In our symmetrical diffusion, couples with Cu diffuse towards both the left and right ends of the nanowire, and the diffusion distance of Cu should be equal for both sides. Under the reaction stage shown in Fig. 3, Cu has reached the coarse end of the Sn segment on the left while it still has not yet reached the fine end of the Sn segment on the right because of its larger length. As a result, the right end of the nanowire appears as pure Sn in the EDS mapping shown in Fig. 3.
The solder reflow temperatures in industry application often go slightly above the melting point of Sn to ensure good bonding [33,34]; hence, it is therefore necessary to check any structural and compositional changes in the IMCs above the melting point of Sn. We therefore examine the structure and composition of the nanowires at the elevated temperature up to 299 °C, which may be of relevance for the potential application in high temperature soldering. The Cu and Sn concentration profiles obtained from the STEM EDS linescan acquired at 299 °C are shown in Fig. 3(e). From x = 0 to x_{3}, the segment is Sn rich. The composition corresponds to η-Cu_{6}Sn_{5} ranging from x_{3} to x_{4} and from x_{5} to x_{6}. There is a narrow segment rich in Sn positioned from x_{4} to x_{5} as indicated by the dashed lines in Fig. 3(e). This is a “spike” with the concentration of Sn ranging from x_{4} to x_{5}. From x_{6} to the right end of the nanowire (x = 3.88 μm), it is molten Sn with a minor amount of Cu. By comparing the concentration profiles taken at 236.5 °C and 299 °C, the temperature induced growth or shrinkage of the phases along the nanowire can be revealed. The position of x_{3} shifts to the left side of the wire as compared to x_{1}, which indicates that the Sn rich segment shortens because Sn diffuses towards the right end of the nanowire. The position of x_{6} shifts toward the left side as compared to the position of x_{2}, which indicates that the length of the molten Sn region increases. Sn atoms from the Sn-rich region (from x = 0 to x_{1}) on the left side diffuse through the solid-state η-Cu_{6}Sn_{5} to support the growth of molten liquid Sn. The “spike” region has a higher concentration of Sn as compared to the surrounding η-Cu_{6}Sn_{5} phase; hence, it is highly possible that incoming Sn reacts with η-Cu_{6}Sn_{5} and forms an Sn-rich molten liquid according to the Cu-Sn phase diagram [32,35]. This eutectic reaction occurs at 227 °C, slightly below the melting point of pure Sn. Especially when the temperature rises beyond the melting point, the diffusivity of Sn atoms in the η-Cu_{6}Sn_{5} solid phase also increases. We can think of the mass flow of both Cu and Sn along one dimension with concentration fluctuation, when there is sufficient amount of Sn, the eutectic reaction occurs and the Sn rich liquid nucleates at the local region [i.e., as pointed by the black arrow in Fig. 3(d)]. Once a stabilized liquid nucleus forms, it will grow and dissolve more Sn [i.e., the concentration “spike” as denoted by the dashed line x_{4} and x_{5} in Fig. 4(e)], and meanwhile Cu will be segregated from the liquid and diffuses into the adjacent solid η-Cu_{6}Sn_{5} gains. The supply of Sn atoms is from the most left side of the Sn-rich region (i.e., from the most left to x_{1}) for the eutectic liquid phase to grow.
The crystal structure and phases of the reacted nanowire with its temperature held at 299 °C are examined by electron diffraction as shown in Fig. 4. Figures 4(b)–4(d) are selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns obtained from areas “1,” “2,” and “3” as encircled by dashed red circles in Fig. 4(a). Areas “1” and “2” are the η-Cu_{6}Sn_{5} phase with different orientations of [111¯] and [241¯], indicating that the soldering reaction has the strong tendency to form polycrystalline η-Cu_{6}Sn_{5} although the parent nanowire has the single-crystalline segments of Cu and Sn. The formation of the polycrystalline η-Cu_{6}Sn_{5} segment can be related to the multiple sites of nucleating the η-Cu_{6}Sn_{5} grains in the parent Cu segment. The diffraction pattern from area “3” has diffuse rings, which confirm the molten state of the Sn-rich segment at the elevated temperature of 299 °C.
As compared to the Cu segment sandwiched by two segments of the soldering material of Sn shown above, one segment of Sn connecting two metallic base parts is more common in real application. Therefore, Cu-Sn-Cu three-segmented nanowires are also studied by in-situ TEM to observe the IMC formation and void growth during the soldering reaction. As known from Fig. 2, the metallurgical reaction, especially the IMC growth, becomes completed mostly before reaching the melting point of Sn. Therefore, the temperature of the nanowires is held at the constant temperature of 200 °C for in-situ TEM observation of the morphological evolution and associated phase evolution. As shown in Fig. 5, the interfaces between the Cu and Sn segments before heating are marked by the red dashed lines in the TEM image at 0 s according to the Cu and Sn elemental maps as shown in Figs. 1(g) and 1(h). At 123 s of heating at 200 °C, a Kirkendall void appears in the Cu segment on the right hand side. The Kirkendall void forms in the Cu segment due to the faster outward diffusion of Cu than the incoming diffusion of Sn. The void grows with time until it breaks the nanowire at 506 s. Meanwhile, there is another void appearing in the Cu segment on the left hand side at 380 s. This void grows larger over time until at 628 s. The void is then observed to shift to the left due to the net mass flow toward right, as shown in the TEM images of 628 s and 751 s. The void continues to grow with time until it completely breaks the wire at 969 s. With continued heating at 200 °C, there is no noticeable change along the nanowire. The large void on the right does not shift because the complete breakage of the Cu segment by the void growth shuts off the supply of Cu and thus terminates the IMC growth. For the void on the right, the void shifts to the left, which is in the same direction as the IMC/Cu interface propagates toward the Cu segment. After the void growth completely breaks up the Cu segment, the void stays stationary over time, similar as the void on the right. Both of the voids shown in Fig. 5 are close to the Cu/IMC interfaces, as confirmed from the EDS and electron diffraction analysis [Figs. 6(d) and 6(e)]. The in-situ TEM observation also shows that a particle (i.e., a bulge with slightly dark image contrast) nucleates and grows near the Cu/Sn interface region. To confirm it is a bulge rather than an embedded precipitate, the sample is tilted with the rotation axis along the length direction of the nanowire. As shown in the last TEM image in Fig. 5, the bulge is clearly visible near the interface of the Cu/Sn segment by tilting the sample. Because TEM imaging is a projection view of a 3D object, the 3D bulge is “invisible” from the planar-view in the time-sequence TEM images in Fig. 5. After the tilting around the axis along the length direction of the nanowire, the bulge becomes visible from the side view of the TEM imaging. As seen in Fig. 2, the areas showing locally darker contrast, as marked by the dashed red circles in Fig. 2 might come from the bulge formation in the Cu segment and near the Cu/Sn interface for the Sn-Cu-Sn couple. Similarly, the bulge formation also occurs for the Sn-Cu-Sn couple in the Cu segment, as shown in Fig. 5. It can be noted that the bulges seen in Fig. 2 are imaged in the plane view, for which the TEM image contrast for the bulges is not as conspicuous as that shown in Fig. 5, where the bulge grows toward the side surface of the nanowire thereby allowing for a cross-sectional view. The comparative in-situ TEM observations indicate that the Sn-Cu-Sn couples tend to form more individual Cu_{6}Sn_{5} bulges than the Cu-Sn-Cu couples because the Sn-Cu-Sn configuration provides more Sn to the Cu segment for the metallurgical reaction to form the Cu_{6}Sn_{5} phase (Figs. 2–4). By contrast, Sn tends to spread into the two Cu segments for the Cu-Sn-Cu configuration, for which the metallurgical reaction results in the formation of the Cu-rich Cu_{3}Sn phase in addition to the Cu_{6}Sn_{5} bulge (see Figs. 5–7).
To uncover the phase and structure of the reacted nanowire including the bulge, electron diffraction combined with chemical composition analysis is performed on the reacted nanowire with its temperature held at 200 °C. Figures 6(b)–6(d) are the SAED patterns obtained, respectively, from areas “1,” “2,” and “3,” as marked in Fig. 6(a). Areas “1,” “2,” and “3” are encircled by the red dashed lines in Fig. 6(a). These diffraction patterns match well with the η-Cu_{6}Sn_{5} structure with the different grain orientations, indicating the tendency to form polycrystalline η-Cu_{6}Sn_{5}. Figure 6(e) is a magnified TEM image corresponding to the area indicated by the red dashed rectangle in Fig. 6(a). Figure 6(f) is an SAED pattern obtained from the area encircled by the large red dashed circle shown in Fig. 6(e). The diffraction spots indicated by the red arrows are exclusively attributed to ε-Cu_{3}Sn [32,35,36], which demonstrate the existence of ε-Cu_{3}Sn in addition to the η-Cu_{6}Sn_{5} phase in the selected area. EDS spectra acquired in the STEM mode from the locations marked by the white crosses and labeled with numbers 1–8 as shown in Fig. 6(e) are plotted in Fig. 6(g). The spectra from bottom to top in Fig. 6(g) correspond to areas “1” to “8,” respectively. The quantitative chemical composition of the different areas marked in Fig. 6(e) can be determined from the EDS spectra shown in Fig. 6(g). As shown in Fig. 6(e), spectra “1” and “2” are acquired from the left side of the Kirkendall void. Spectrum “1” has over 99 at. % Cu and spectrum “2” indicates over 92 at. % Cu. The nearly pure Cu confirms that the Kirkendall void forms preferentially in the Cu segment because of the faster outward diffusion of Cu than the inward diffusion of Sn. The continued growth of the void results in the breakage of the Cu segment with remnant Cu in the nanowire. Spectra from area “3,” “4,” “5,” and “7” have the Cu content close to 75 at. %, which matches well with the composition in the ε-Cu_{3}Sn structure. The spectrum acquired from the bulge gives 62.8 at. % Cu, which is close to the composition of η-Cu_{6}Sn_{5} and it confirms with the electron diffraction structural analysis from the bulge as shown in Fig. 6(b). The chemical composition from area “8” has 61.2 at. % Cu, which matches with the composition of the η-Cu_{6}Sn_{5} phase. Figure 6(d) shows the electron diffraction analysis to reveal that the void on the right is adjacent to the Cu_{6}Sn5 phase and Fig. 6(e) illustrate the EDS measurements that confirm the void on the left is between the Cu and Cu_{3}Sn phase, which show the presence of pure Cu and 77 at. % Cu (i.e., Cu_{3}Sn) surrounding the void on the left.
To further confirm the chemical composition, an EDS linescan along the length direction of the reacted nanowire with its temperature held at 200 °C is taken and the measured concentration profile is shown in Fig. 7. Five different compositions can be identified from the composition profile across the length direction of the nanowire. As shown in Fig. 7, remnant Cu with more than 95 at. % Cu in the two parent Cu segments (i.e., the solid solution of Sn in Cu) is indicated by the red arrows. Kirkendall voids with the concentration of both Cu and Sn drop to zero, and are located between the Cu segment and IMC phases. The ε-Cu_{3}Sn region with approximately 75 at. % Cu is indicated by the black arrow in Fig. 7. The η-Cu_{6}Sn_{5} segment with 60 at. % Cu is indicated by the purple arrow in Fig. 7. There is a “spike” of high concentration of Sn in the η-Cu_{6}Sn_{5} region. This is due to the remnant Sn from the parent Sn segment.
Figure 8 shows the schematic illustrations that summarize the key difference in the metallurgical reactions of the sandwiched structures of the three-segmented Cu/Sn/Cu and Sn/Cu/Sn nanowires. For the three-segment Sn/Cu/Sn nanowires [Figs. 8(a)–8(c)], our in-situ TEM analyses (Figs. 2–4) demonstrate that there is no ε-Cu_{3}Sn formation from the metallurgical reaction. The absence of the ε-Cu_{3}Sn phase can be attributed to the relative shortage of the supply of Cu as compared to Sn. Kirkendall void formation occurs initially in the parent Cu segment. The incoming diffusing Sn atoms from the two Sn segments to the sandwiched Cu segment can subsequently refill the void in the Cu segment. These incoming Sn atoms react with Cu and form multiple grains of η-Cu_{6}Sn_{5} and the whole wire only has one single intermetallic phase of η-Cu_{6}Sn_{5} from the metallurgical reaction. With continued heating at a temperature slightly above the melting point of Sn, there is Sn-rich liquid phase formed between the η-Cu_{6}Sn_{5} grains. The presence of the Sn-rich liquid phase can pose a significant threat to the mechanical properties of the joints. Our further TEM analyses show that this Sn-rich liquid phase does not transform to any IMC phases after the sample is cooled to room temperature because of the lack of Cu for the IMC formation.
For the three-segmented Cu/Sn/Cu nanowires [Figs. 8(d)–8(f)], our in-situ TEM analyses shown in Figs. 5–7 demonstrate that the metallurgical reaction results in the intermetallic phases of multiple grains of both Cu_{3}Sn and Cu_{6}Sn_{5} with a bulge of the single-crystal Cu_{6}Sn_{5} grain formed on the Cu_{3}Sn segment. Kirkendall void formation occurs in each parent Cu segment. The growth of the voids in the two Cu segments leads to the breakage of the nanowire, which may pose a threat to the integrity and mechanical strength and reliability of the joints. For the Cu/Sn/Cu configuration, adding a barrier layer between the Cu/Sn to reduce the diffusion rate of Cu into Sn may be necessary for reducing the growth of the Kirkendall voids in the Cu segment. Optimizing the relative lengths of the segments of Cu and Sn along with the temperature and time above or near the melting point of Sn might be essential to avoid the formation of the liquid phase in the intermetallic phase and overgrowth of the Kirkendall voids in the segments of the base metal. The in-situ TEM results shown above provide dynamic information of the Cu/Sn metallurgical reaction including Kirkendall voiding, IMC formation, and bulging. The in-situ TEM observations show that the IMC growth can lead to the shrinkage and disappearance of Kirkendall voids (Fig. 2). On the other hand, the complete breakage of the nanowire with the void growth can shut off the supply of Cu atoms and thus terminate the IMC growth (Fig. 5). This differs from the bulk Cu/Sn system, in which the Kirkendall void formation may not significantly slow down the IMC growth because inter-diffusion can still occur through the surrounding area of the void. Our in-situ TEM observations also reveal the temporal and spatial dependence of the IMC phases on the geometrical configuration of the solder and base metal. The Sn/Cu/Cu configuration forms the Cu_{6}Sn_{5} phase, while the Cu/Sn/Cu configuration results in the intermetallic phases of both Cu_{6}Sn_{5} and Cu_{3}Sn because the latter configuration provides more Cu to form the Cu-rich Cu_{3}Sn phase. From the in-situ TEM observations, we find that bulging occurs mainly in the region close to the Cu/Cu_{6}Sn_{5} interface. The temporal and spatial movement of the Cu/IMC interface may result in the formation of multiple bulges over time (Fig. 2). Such dynamic information cannot be readily obtained from post-mortem TEM observations, even with ex-situ experiments performed under the same reaction condition.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
In-situ TEM has been employed to study the soldering reaction of three-segmented Sn/Cu/Sn and Cu/Sn/Cu diffusion couples to mimic the real life application of these sandwiched nanowire structures. For the Sn/Cu/Sn diffusion couple, there is no ε-Cu_{3}Sn formation from the intermetallic reactions due to the relatively short supply of Cu as compared to Sn. The initially formed Kirkendall voids in the Cu segment can be subsequently refilled by the volume expansion associated with the IMC growth. The incoming Sn atoms react with the Cu segment to form η-Cu_{6}Sn_{5} and the entire nanowire has only one single intermetallic phase of η-Cu_{6}Sn_{5}. With continued heating at a temperature slightly above the melting point of Sn, there is a Sn rich liquid phase formed between the η-Cu_{6}Sn_{5} grains. For the metallurgical reaction in the Cu/Sn/Cu diffusion couple, the resulting intermetallic phases consist of both Cu_{3}Sn and Cu_{6}Sn_{5}, and a bulge with the single-crystalline Cu_{6}Sn_{5} grain formed on the Cu_{3}Sn segment. Kirkendall void formation occurs in each of the parent Cu segments and the continued void growth results in the breakage of the reacted nanowire and thus the termination of the IMC growth.
