A comprehensive alpha-heating model for inertial confinement fusion
A comprehensive model is developed to study alpha-heating in inertially confined plasmas. It describes the time evolution of a central low-density hot spot confined by a compressible shell, heated by fusion alphas, and cooled by radiation and thermal losses. The model includes the deceleration, stagnation, and burn phases of inertial confinement fusion implosions, and is valid for sub-ignited targets with ≤10× amplification of the fusion yield from alpha-heating. The results of radiation-hydrodynamic simulations are used to derive realistic initial conditions and dimensionless parameters for the model. It is found that most of the alpha energy (∼90%) produced before bang time is deposited within the hot spot mass, while a small fraction (∼10%) drives mass ablation off the inner shell surface and its energy is recycled back into the hot spot. Of the bremsstrahlung radiation emission, ∼40% is deposited in the hot spot, ∼40% is recycled back in the hot spot by ablation off the shell, and ∼20% leaves the hot spot. We show here that the hot spot, shocked shell, and outer shell trajectories from this analytical model are in good agreement with simulations. A detailed discussion of the effect of alpha-heating on the hydrodynamics is also presented.
I. INTRODUCTION
In inertial confinement fusion (ICF), a cryogenic shell of deuterium (D) and tritium (T) is accelerated inward via direct irradiation by a laser (direct-drive) or x-rays (indirect drive) [1,2]. As the shell converges, it delivers PdV work to the inner low-density central region—denoted as the “hot spot.” Upon stagnation, the hot-spot plasma reaches temperatures of 4 to 7 keV and pressures of 100 to 500 Gbar, thereby triggering copious amounts of fusion reactions. Alpha particles from the D—T fusion reactions deposit their energy primarily to the plasma electrons, increasing the plasma temperature and the fusion reaction rate (which in turn enhances the alpha energy deposition rate). This process is called “alpha-heating,” and ignition is a direct consequence of this positive feedback cycle. The end goal is to create large energy gains from a burn wave that propagates through the dense shell.
In the United States, two laser experimental facilities routinely implode cryogenic DT targets. The National Ignition Facility delivers (NIF) ∼1.6 to1.8 MJ of 0.35–μm light via a temporally shaped pulse into a high-Z hohlraum, which converts the laser energy into an x-ray bath that ablatively accelerates the target inward [3]. The OMEGA laser facility is a direct-drive facility in which the 60-beam OMEGA laser focuses 25 to 30 kJ of 0.35-μm laser energy directly onto the capsule [4]. In recent years, the high-foot implosion campaign on the NIF has achieved conditions under which alpha-particle deposition is expected to have a significant impact on hot spot dynamics [5–10]. Theoretical models have predicted that the neutron yield in these implosions doubled as a result of this alpha-heating [10–12]. Similar alpha-heating levels have also been inferred from hydrodynamic extrapolations of OMEGA implosions to 1.9 MJ [13,14]. It is for this reason that it is important to understand how alpha-heating impacts the hot spot and shell dynamics in ICF implosions.
In this work, the physics of alpha-heating in sub-ignited implosions when alpha-heating begins to impact the hot-spot physics is studied through a time-dependent semi-analytical model of the hot-spot and compressible imploding shell. Alpha-heating primarily occurs during the deceleration phase of ICF implosions which occurs when the hot-spot pressure exceeds the shell pressure and a strong stagnation shock is launched into the shell. The physics of hot-spot formation in the deceleration phase has been comprehensively analyzed in Refs [15–18]. These models solve the fluid equations in the hot-spot and the stagnated shell to obtain the final hot-spot pressure, temperature, radius, and shocked-shell trajectory. In this work, we derive a compressible-shell model similar to Refs [11] and  [15–17] for the purpose of studying the physics of alpha-heating in the deceleration phase. In this model, we show a detailed derivation of the hot-spot and shell properties based on the Mach^{2} expansion parameter in the hot-spot. We also use a comprehensive ensemble of radiation–hydrodynamic simulations from the code LILAC [25] to derive realistic initial conditions for the onset of the deceleration phase, as well as to determine the fraction of deposited alpha energy and the reabsorbed bremsstrahlung radiation. It will be shown later that the hot-spot, stagnation shock, and outer shell trajectories calculated from the compressible-shell model are in good agreement with radiation–hydrodynamic simulations. This model will then be used to understand and develop alpha-heating metrics in a subsequent publication. In particular, it will be shown that the model is in good agreement with alpha-heating curves that connect experimental observables to alpha-heating metrics.
This paper is organized as follows: Sec. II describes a simple model of alpha-heating to highlight the essential physics; Sec. III describes the implosion simulation database used to derive the initial conditions for the onset of the deceleration phase; and Sec. IV describes the compressible-shell alpha-heating model for ICF implosions in the deceleration phase, as well as the effect of alpha-heating on the hot-spot and shell dynamics.
II. BASIC PHYSICS OF ALPHA-HEATING: SIMPLIFIED MODEL
A simplified model describing the alpha-heating process of an ICF plasma is introduced in this section to highlight the origin of the relevant metrics and basic physics. In particular, we will use this model to introduce the burning plasma parameter Q_{α} and to show that it is correlated with the yield enhancement due to alpha-heating [11].
We first consider the plasma of the central hot-spot heated and compressed by the surrounding imploding shell. Although radiation losses are an important part of the energy balance, we neglect them in this simple model since the intention here is to illustrate, in the simplest possible way, the relation between different alpha-heating metrics. Radiation losses are included in the comprehensive alpha-heating model in Sec. IV. For simplicity, we also separate the compression phase up to stagnation from the alpha-heating phase and make the simplifying assumption that alpha-heating is only relevant starting from the stagnation conditions that are achieved from pure hydrodynamic compression. For this reason, the initial stagnation hot-spot pressure is denoted with P_{noα} to indicate that such a pressure was produced by the spherical compression without the contribution from alpha-heating. This simplification is used here only to provide an overview of the alpha-heating metrics. In a real implosion, alpha-heating and PdV work are simultaneously supplied to the hot-spot plasma until stagnation, after which the hot-spot loses energy because of volume expansion. The compressible-shell model used in Sec. IV includes the effects of alpha-heating and radiation losses throughout the different implosion phases and does not separate the compression and alpha-heating phases. With this in mind, a simple version of the hot-spot energy conservation equation describing the alpha-heating process occurring soon after stagnation can be written as
where V_{hs} is the hot-spot volume, P_{hs} is the hot-spot pressure, 〈σv〉 is the fusion reactivity, n=P_{hs}/2T is the total (D + T) ion density, T is the hot-spot temperature, and ε_{α}=3.5 MeV is the alpha-particle birth energy. This equation simply balances the change in hot-spot energy with the alpha-heating (first term on the right-hand side) and the expansion losses (second term on the right-hand side). As done in Refs [15–18], the subsonic approximation is used where the hot-spot's kinetic energy is neglected with respect to the internal energy. It is also assumed here that the thermal conduction heat losses are recycled back into the hot-spot, as was argued in Ref [18]. Therefore, the main source of energy loss is the expansion of the shell under the hot-spot pressure that occurs over an inertial confinement time τ_{E}. For a thin shell (where shell thickness ≪ hot-spot radius), τ_{E} is determined by balancing the hot-spot force with the shell deceleration
where M_{shell} is the stagnated shell mass and P_{hs} and R_{hs} are the hot-spot pressure and radius (the latter equal to the shell radius for a thin shell). As described in Ref [22], the confinement time can therefore be estimated from the shell inertia as follows:
For an adiabatic expansion in the absence of alpha-heating, the radius is a weak function of the pressure (R_{hs}∼Phs1/5 for an ideal gas with three degrees of freedom). In the presence of alpha-heating, the pressure changes even more rapidly with respect to the radius than in the adiabatic case. Therefore, to avoid introducing a new equation for the radius, we neglect the dependence of τ_{E} on R_{hs} and assume that the hot-spot volume increases over a characteristic time scale τ_{E} such that
The factor of 3/5 is used to normalize the equation in such a way that in the absence of alpha-heating, the hot-spot pressure decays over a time scale τ_{E} (dp_{hs}/dt=−p_{hs}/τ_{E}). It follows that the hot-spot pressure is the only time-varying quantity in the simplified hot-spot energy equation
where τ_{E}∼1/P_{hs}. In this simple model, the fusion reactivity is taken to follow a quadratic dependence on temperature (〈σv〉∼T^{2}) typical of fusion plasmas above 6 keV and up to 20 keV. Those temperatures are higher than the typical temperatures of 4 to 7 keV achieved from hydrodynamic compression in current ICF ignition designs. We use this assumption only in this simple model so that a separate equation is not needed to compute the temperature. Therefore, the hot-spot energy equation depends only on the pressure and can be written in the following dimensionless form:
where the dimensionless variables are defined as P̂=P_{hs}/P_{noα},t̂=t/τ_{noα}, and the dimensionless parameter χ_{noα} is
where S_{α}=24T^{2}/〈σv〉ε_{α} is a constant for 〈σv〉∼T^{2}. Note that χ_{noα} is a normalized form of the well-known Lawson parameter nTτ∼Pτ and that the confinement times from Eq. (3) with and without alphas are related by the simple relation τ_{E}=τ_{α}=τ_{noα}/P̂ [19–23].
For the initial condition P̂(0)=1, the solution of Eq. (6) is P̂(t̂)=1 if χ_{noα}=1. If χ_{noα}<1, then dP̂/dt̂<0 and the pressure decays. If χ_{noα}>1, then dP̂/dt̂>0 and the pressure increases in time without bound. It is for this reason that χ_{noα}=1 is called the “ignition condition.”
Using the initial condition P̂(0)=1, the solution of Eq. (6) can be written in the following implicit form:
By setting P̂=∞, Eq. (8) exhibits an explosive singularity at t̂=t̂{sing} given by
The volume expansion V̂=V_{hs}/V_{noα} is determined by integrating Eq. (4) after substituting dt̂=dP̂/(χ_{noα}P̂{2}−P̂{3/2}) from Eq. (6). This leads to
The solution of the model is plotted in Fig. 1, where the blue region denotes the sub-ignited alpha-heating state and the red region denotes the state of an ignited plasma. The condition χ_{noα}=1 can be used to define the ignition condition for the thermal runaway process. For χ_{noα}<1 (sub-ignited hot-spot), the alpha-heating is not intense enough to lead to the ignition of the hot-spot but it can significantly contribute to the energetics of the hot-spot, leading to an amplification of the fusion output. This sub-ignited state is typically called the alpha-heating regime. The level of alpha-heating is evaluated by determining the amplification of the fusion yield caused by the alpha energy deposition Y_{α} with respect to the pure compression yield without alpha deposition Y_{noα}.
In the absence of alpha deposition, the solution of Eq. (6) leads to the pressure decay P̂=(1+t̂/2){−2}. This corresponds to a volume expansion of V̂=(1+t̂/2){6/5}. The fusion yield can be easily calculated by integrating the fusion rate in time leading to
Calculating the yield with alphas is a bit more complicated because the solution with alpha-heating cannot be expressed as an analytical function of time. One way is to use the expression for dt from Eq. (6) to evaluate the integral in Eq. (11) as follows:
This integral is evaluated numerically as a function of χ_{noα}. A good approximation to this function is I(χ_{noα})≈109(1−χnoα){−1.1}.
Retaining the alpha-heating contribution, Eq. (6) for the pressure can be used to compute the neutron yield that can be written in the following form:
By taking the ratio of Eqs. (13) and (11), the yield amplification caused by alpha-heating (Ŷ{amp}≡Y_{α}/Y_{noα}) depends exclusively on the no-alpha Lawson parameter
and becomes infinite as χ_{noα} approaches unity. This is the reason χ_{noα} is a useful ignition metric. In an experiment where alpha-heating is prominent, it is necessary to compute χ_{noα} to assess progress toward ignition. It is straightforward to realize that the Lawson parameter as defined in Eq. (7) can be easily related to measurable parameters, including the areal density ρΔ, the neutron yield Y_{noα}, the hot-spot radius R_{noα}, and the shell mass M_{shell}. In the case of a compressible-shell ICF implosion, the stagnated shell mass at peak neutron production should be used since this is the mass that provides inertial confinement to the hot-spot. This requires elimination of the variables P_{hs},τ_{E}, and R_{noα}. We start by substituting the confinement time from Eq. (3) into Eq. (7) to obtain
Substituting the confinement time from Eq. (3) into Eq. (11) for the neutron yield Y_{noα} results in the following expression for the no-alpha pressure:
The Lawson parameter χ_{noα} can then be rewritten in terms of M_{shell}, Y_{noα}, and R_{noα}
In the thin shell limit, the shell mass can be written as M_{shell}≈4πRnoα2(ρΔ){sh} where (ρΔ){sh} is the areal density of the shell. This relation can then be used to eliminate R_{noα} from χ_{noα} as follows:
If one can neglect the hot-spot contribution to the total areal density with respect to the shell's contribution, then (ρΔ){sh}≃(ρR){tot} and Eq. (18) indicates that
where the experimental ignition threshold factor ITFx [23] is generalized to arbitrary DT mass in Refs [12] and  [24]. The new expression of χ_{noα} in Eq. (18) requires noα parameters and can be measured only from experiments where alpha-heating is having a negligible impact on the hydrodynamics. This parameter cannot be directly measured in experiments where alpha-heating is significant. However, since the areal density is much less sensitive than the neutron yield to the effects of alpha-heating (at least for low-yield amplifications <10), one can assume (ρR){α}≃(ρR){noα} and use the measured yield (with alphas) in Eq. (18). This defines a new Lawson parameter χ_{α} that includes the alpha contribution to the yield and can be measured in experiments
Note that χ_{α} and χ_{noα} are related through the yield amplification
A convenient feature of Eq. (20) allows one to substitute Eq. (20) into Eq. (14), leading to an equation relating the measureable parameter χ_{α} to both the yield amplification from alpha-heating and the no-alpha Lawson parameter χ_{noα}. This implies that measuring the neutron yield and the areal density for a given DT stagnating mass (assuming M_{shell}≃M_{DT} and M_{hs}≪M_{shell}) is sufficient to determine χ_{α}, the yield amplification caused by alpha-heating, and χ_{noα}. The Lawson parameter χ_{α} is related to χ_{noα} via the fitting relation Ŷ{amp}≈e^{1.2χα} from solving Eqs. (14) and (20). As χ_{α} approaches infinity, the yield amplification approaches infinity and χ_{noα} approaches unity.
It is important to note that, in this simple model, the hot-spot energy at stagnation (here t = 0) comes from the PdV or compression work of the shell; therefore, 3/2P_{noα}V_{hs}=W_{PdV}. Using Eq. (13) to infer the alpha-particle energy deposition in the hot-spot (E_{α}=Y_{α}ε_{α}), the ratio of half the alpha energy to the input work Q_{α}≡0.5E_{α}/W_{PdV} is a unique function of χ_{noα}
The use of only half of the alpha energy in the definition of Q_{α} is because of the transient character of ICF since the alpha particles deposited in the hot-spot before bang time are of the most interest [11]. The yield amplification is an approximately unique function of Q_{α} and can be best approximated as Ŷ{amp}≈1+1.9Q_{α}.
The relation between yield amplification and Q_{α} is not something which is unique to ICF plasmas. The alpha-heating process in magnetically confined plasmas can also be described from the yield amplification — Q_{α} relation. This system is better described by considering a steady-state energy balance where the alpha-heating rate is balanced by the external heating power—the thermal loss rate
where V_{p} is the plasma volume and Ẇ{input} is the external power input to the plasma balanced by the alpha-heating (Ẇ{α}, the second term) and the thermal losses (the third term). For simplicity, 〈σv〉∼T^{2}, radiation losses are neglected, and the energy confinement time is assumed to be a decreasing function of pressure (τ_{E}∼1/P^{μ} with μ<1) to approximate the enhancement of thermal losses as the temperature gradient increases. Equation (22) can be solved with and without alpha-particle energy deposition to find P_{α} and P_{noα} and the yield amplification caused by alpha-heating is simply Ŷampsteady=(Pα/Pnoα){2}. A straightforward manipulation leads to the following form of the yield amplification:
Note that for μ≈0.4, the Ŷ{amp} versus Q_{α} curves for inertial and magnetic fusion approximately overlap for 0<Q_{α}<2.5. In Fig. 2, the burning-plasma parameter Q_{α} is plotted as a function of the yield amplification for both the simple model described above and the steady-state model. These curves indicate that the yield amplification is a useful metric for identifying the onset of the burning-plasma regime (Q_{α}=1) in both inertial and magnetic confinement fusion. The burning-plasma regime Q_{α}=1 requires yield amplifications ≈ 3. As shown later, the conclusions of the simple model qualitatively agree with the results of a more-comprehensive shell model including radiation losses and the compressible-shell dynamics. Radiation losses are a main factor which contributes to this discrepancy, as well as differences in the shell motion which are captured by the compressible-shell model but not by the simple model.
III. IMPLOSION SIMULATION DATABASE
In a typical laser fusion target, a shell of cryogenic DT is accelerated inward by direct illumination (direct drive) or by laser-induced xrays (indirect drive). Once the driver turns off, the acceleration phase ends, and the shell coasts inward at the implosion velocity. Meanwhile, the initial shocks induced by the driver heat up the central gas. The shocks converge in the center, travel outward, and are reflected at the inner shell surface. The central gas pressure also increases due to PdV compression from the shell. Both the compression and the shock reflection processes occur until the gas pressure exceeds the inner shell pressure, at which point a strong shock is launched into the shell. This marks the beginning of the deceleration phase where the shocked shell is decelerated by the high pressure of the central low-density region (denoted by the hot-spot). The remainder of the shell does not contribute to the hot-spot stagnation physics because it is free-falling inward. It is during this phase that the shell delivers most of the PdV work to the hot-spot. The physics of the acceleration phase determines the shell's kinetic energy, aspect ratio, and shell mass at the beginning of the deceleration phase. Apart from these initial conditions, the physics of hot-spot formation and alpha-heating is independent of how the target is driven. The physics of alpha-heating is therefore the same for direct-drive and indirect-drive implosions.
The results from the analytical model of the deceleration phase will be compared to a 1-D direct-drive simulation ensemble of 13 targets using the hydrocode LILAC [25], which include 3D ray tracing, flux-limited thermal transport, multigroup alpha transport, multigroup radiation transport, astrophysical opacity tables, and SESAME [26] equation-of-state tables. These are purely hydrodynamic simulations and do not include modifications to the distribution functions which can be fusion reactivities for large values of the Knudsen number [27,28]. All of the implosions are driven with a laser driver of wavelength λ_{L}=0.35μm. The maximum shell kinetic energy in the 1-D LILAC simulation ensemble varies from 1 kJ to 80 kJ, so a wide variety of target sizes are incorporated into the ensemble. The DT shell adiabat varies between 0.5 and 5, where the adiabat for a fully ionized plasma is defined as α=2.2p/ρ^{5/3} for p being the shell pressure in Mbar and ρ being the shell density in g/cm{3} [29]. Its value is quoted as the minimum adiabat at the inner shell surface at the shock breakout time. It can be less than unity when the DT is not fully ionized, which happens for weak shocks. Some of the targets are designed using the adiabat-shaping technique, which shapes the entropy profile to be minimum on the inner shell surface and maximum on the outer shell surface [30]. Other designs in the ensemble do not use adiabat shaping and have a flat adiabat profile. The implosion velocity in the ensemble varies between 200 km/s and 600 km/s. The in-flight quantities can affect the alpha-heating curves by changing the initial conditions for the deceleration phase, such as the shell's aspect ratio, kinetic energy, temperature, and radius.
The relevant parameter for measuring the impact of alpha-heating in these simulations is the yield amplification. It is calculated by running two simulations: one with alpha deposition on and the other with alpha deposition off. The solution without alpha deposition does not include the effect of alpha-heating on the implosion. The simulated neutron yield, from the no-alpha and with-alpha simulations, is denoted as Y_{noα} and Y_{α}, respectively. The database is obtained by designing targets with a yield amplification of approximately 10. These implosions are then degraded by a variety of mechanisms including implosion velocity reduction, entropy degradation, and convergence ratio reduction (via increasing initial inner gas density).
IV. DYNAMIC HOT-SPOT AND SHELL MODEL
The compressible-shell model described here is similar to the models from Refs [15–17], which consider only the deceleration phase of the implosion. The shell is initially free-falling inward at the implosion velocity V_{i} with an inner radius R_{0}. The hot-spot's central pressure and temperature are very small relative to their stagnation values. At time t = t_{0}, a strong shock is launched into the shell. For t>t_{0}, the shell is divided into two parts: the shocked shell and the free-falling shell. Figure 3 describes the system near the time of peak neutron production when approximately half of the shell has been stagnated. The shocked portion of the shell has been decelerated by the large hot-spot pressure and transfers its kinetic energy into PdV work of the hot-spot. The free-falling shell is not affected by the hot-spot pressure force. In this work, we do not consider multidimensional effects, which can significantly complicate the picture.
The governing equations for the hot-spot, shocked shell, and free-fall shell consist of the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy. These equations are given by
Here, ρ,U, and p denote the fluid density, velocity, and pressure, respectively, and ε=3p/2+ρU^{2}/2 is the plasma internal energy. The terms W_{rad} and W_{α}, respectively, represent the radiation losses and the alpha-heating rate. The parameter κ denotes the plasma thermal conductivity. The radiation, alpha-heating, and thermal conduction terms all depend on temperature T, which is governed by the ideal equation of state
where m_{i} is the ion mass and it has been assumed that the plasma (1) contains only hydrogen (Z = 1), (2) is fully ionized, and (3) is in thermodynamic equilibrium such that the electron and ion temperatures are equal. Equations (24) and (25) can be combined to yield a simpler form of the momentum equation
Across some interface η(t), the terms within the gradients must be continuous to avoid singularities in the solutions. Letting w≡U−η̇, it follows that the jump conditions are:
Here, F_{rad} and F_{α} refer to the energy flux across a boundary from radiation and alphas, respectively. The strategy in this model is to integrate each fluid equation over the regional boundaries under the assumption of certain pressure, temperature, velocity, and density profiles within each region. Jump conditions at each boundary are used to connect the solutions. The free-fall conditions are well known so the Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions are sufficient to determine the post-shock density, pressure, and shock velocity. The shocked shell's fluid velocity is determined by assuming a linear velocity profile in the shell and determining the inner shell velocity gradient from entropy conservation in the shocked shell. The integrated mass and momentum equations within the shell are then used to determine the shocked-shell mass M_{ss} and the mass-averaged shocked shell velocity 〈U_{ss}〉. Jump conditions connect the shocked-shell solution to the hot-spot variables, which are also then solved from the fluid equations.
The normalizing factors in the solution are determined from the stagnation values of the simplest model for hot-spot dynamics, where the thin shell is incompressible and the hot-spot is compressed adiabatically (no radiation losses nor alpha-heating). For an adiabatic index of 5/3, it follows that
where P_{hs} denotes the hot-spot central pressure and R(t) denotes the hot-spot radius. In the limit of an infinite aspect ratio (shell thickness ≪ shell radius), all of the shell's kinetic energy is transferred to internal energy at stagnation. It follows that
where M_{sh} is the unablated shell mass, V_{i} is the implosion velocity, P_{s} is the stagnation pressure, and R_{s} is the stagnation hot-spot radius. Letting
denote the ratio of shell's kinetic energy to the initial hot-spot's internal energy, it can be easily shown that the initial conditions are R(0)/R_{s}=ϵ01/2 and P_{hs}(0)/P_{s}=ϵ0−5/2. Since ϵ_{0}≫1, this means that the hot-spot pressure is much smaller than its stagnation value and the hot-spot radius is much larger than its stagnation value, as expected. The thin-shell adiabatic model from Ref [20] is summarized by the energy conservation equation P̂R̂{5}=1 and shell Newton's law P̂R̂{2}=d^{2}R̂/dτ^{2}, where the hot-spot central pressure P_{hs} and radius R are normalized to the adiabatic stagnation values P_{s} and R_{s}, respectively, such that P̂≡P_{hs}/P_{s} and R̂≡R/R_{s}. The normalized time τ=V_{i}t/R_{s}. A simple example of this solution is shown in Fig. 4 where the radius and pressure are plotted as a function of time for ϵ_{0}=100. In that figure, τ̂=τ/τ_{bang} is the time normalized to the bang time τ_{bang}=R(0)/R_{s}=ϵ_{0}.
Typical values of ϵ_{0} at the beginning of the deceleration phase range between 20 and 100, as indicated by the 1-D LILAC simulation ensemble in Fig. 5. In the simulations, the hot-spot boundary is defined as the radius at which the density is equal to the average of the maximum shell density and the central hot-spot density. The deceleration phase time here is defined as the time at which the system has achieved its peak kinetic energy. Since inward kinetic energy is what matters in this system, the outer shell surface is defined as where the velocity is zero. Therefore, all of the inward kinetic energy is accounted for in the calculation of ϵ_{0}, which is estimated by taking the ratio of the shell's kinetic energy to the hot-spot internal energy at the deceleration phase time.
The hot-spot temperature can also be determined from the hot-spot mass conservation equation from Ref [20]
Equation (35) balances the change in hot-spot mass with the mass flow into the hot-spot from thermal conduction–driven ablation off the inner shell surface. The heat flux is calculated from the energy conservation jump condition at the hot-spot - cold shell interface using the Spitzer model κ=κ_{0}T^{5/2} [35] for thermal conductivity, where κ_{0}≈3.7×10^{69}m^{−1}s^{−1}J^{−5/2} for ln Λ≈5 and T is in Joules. The hot-spot central temperature T_{0} is normalized to T_{*}, which is chosen to make the hot-spot mass conservation equation dimensionless such that T̂=T_{0}/T_{*}. In particular, the normalizing factor is given by
where μ_{1}=∫01T̃(r̂){−1}r̂{2}dr̂≈0.51 represents the dependence of the hot-spot mass on the integrand ∫ρdV for a temperature profile of the form T̃(r̂)=(1−r̂2){2/7}. This calculation will be described later in the derivation of the hot-spot mass-conservation equation. An initial hot-spot central temperature of T̂(0)=ϵ0−1/2 is chosen because it guarantees that the stagnation temperature will be independent of the initial temperature for ϵ_{0}→∞, as argued in Ref [20].
The compressible model will be solved using dimensionless variables normalized to the stagnation pressure P_{s}, radius R_{s}, and temperature T_{*} from this simple adiabatic model. The shocked-shell mass M_{ss} and velocity U_{ss} are, respectively, normalized to the shell mass M_{sh} and the implosion velocity V_{i}. The shock position R_{k} is normalized to the stagnation radius R_{s} of the simple adiabatic model.
A. Hot-spot pressure
The hot-spot velocity profile is assumed to vary linearly with radius. The velocity must vanish at the center and approach the hot-spot convergence rate at the hot-spot boundary. A reasonable estimate for the spatial profile is therefore
To solve for pressure, we use the ideal-gas equation of state ρ=pm_{i}/(2T) and T_{hs}(r,t)=T_{0}(t)T̃(r̂), where r̂=r/R and T̃ is the temperature profile within the hot-spot given by
where r̂≡r/R,T(r,t)=T_{0}(t)T̃(r̂), and T_{0}(t) is the hot-spot central temperature. This temperature profile is a good fit to the self-similar solution from Betti et_al in Ref [17] and it gives rise to a finite heat flux at the hot-spot boundary when the thermal conductivity κ∼T^{5/2}. Using the hot-spot velocity profile from Eq. (37) in the momentum conservation equation [Eq. (25)] gives the following result:
Using the ideal equation of state P_{hs}=2ρ_{hs}T_{hs}/m_{i}, Eq. (39) can be rewritten in terms of dimensionless parameters as follows:
where r̂=r/R,T̃ denotes the spatial temperature profile, and T̂=T_{0}/T_{*} denotes the normalized central hot-spot temperature. It is clear that the right-hand side scales like Mach^{2} and is therefore small. By definition, the hot-spot's Mach number is equal to the implosion velocity over the sound speed
where T_{s}≈0.8T_{*} is calculated by solving the adiabatic thin-shell model with ϵ_{0}→∞. It follows that Eq. (40) can be rewritten as
where C(τ)≡R̂T̂^{−1}d^{2}R̂/dτ^{2}. Because ϵ_{0} is calculated for these implosions, P_{s},R_{s}, and T_{*} can also be estimated from the adiabatic thin-shell model. These variables are then used to determine the Mach^{2} term for each target. In Fig. 6, it is evident that Mach^{2} lies between 0.03 and 0.1 and can be neglected. In this limit, the pressure is isobaric and p̃≈1 for P_{hs}=P_{0}(t)p̃(r̂).
The Mach^{2} values from the simulations are calculated exactly from Eq. (41). If ϵ_{0} is known, then the stagnation quantities such as P_{s} and R_{s} can be estimated from the initial P_{hs}(0) and R(0). The normalization temperature is calculated from Eq. (36), where the implosion velocity is calculated at the beginning of the deceleration phase when the return shock begins to propagate in the shell. The total inward kinetic energy in the shell, KE_{0}, and the mass encompassed by this region M_{sh} are computed and the implosion velocity is then defined as V_{i}=2KE_{0}/M_{sh}. This is the definition of the implosion velocity that gives the correct shell kinetic energy, when Vi2 is multiplied by M_{sh}/2.
B. Shocked-shell velocity
In the thin-shell model, the hot-spot and shell radius overlap and the shock trajectory is given exactly by the hot-spot radius. In the thick shell model, the hot-spot trajectory depends on the motion of the shock through the shell. The velocity is not constant in the shell as the stagnation shock propagates through. In this model, the shock trajectory is determined by specifying the fluid velocity at the shock front. This is accomplished by Taylor expanding the shocked-shell velocity U_{ss} about the hot-spot radius
where U_{ss}(R,t)=dR/dt−V_{a}≈dR/dt. As done in Refs [15–17], the velocity derivative is determined from the entropy conservation equation in the shell
Here, the energy-conservation equation has simply been rewritten under the assumption that alpha-particle deposition and radiation heating from the hot-spot are negligible in the shell. For sub-ignited implosions, this is a good approximation since most of the alpha energy and radiated energy are deposited within the hot-spot (as will be shown later in this paper). The parameter γ_{s} is the adiabatic exponent in the shell. To compute the velocity derivative, the entropy conservation equation can be more conveniently rewritten as
The velocity derivative is therefore
This derivative can be evaluated by setting P_{ss}(R,t)≈P_{hs}(R,t). This follows by considering the subsonic momentum jump condition about the hot-spot boundary: [p]R^{−}R^{+}=[ρ(U−dR/dt){2}]R^{−}R^{+}≈0 in the subsonic approximation. Evaluating about the hot-spot boundary, the velocity derivative becomes
C. Shock position in the shell
In their most general form, the Rankine–Hugoniot conditions calculate the postshock velocity U_{2}, density ρ_{2}, and sound speed C_{s2}=(p2γs/ρ2){1/2} in terms of the unshocked velocity U_{1}, density ρ_{1}, sound speed C_{s1}, and shock strength z=(p_{2}−p_{1})/p_{1}. The Rankine–Hugoniot relations can be written as
Here, γ_{s} is the adiabatic index of the shell and R_{k} is the return shock trajectory. Note that for the inertially confined system described here, region 2 denotes the shocked shell, while region 1 denotes the free-falling shell. In the limit of a strong shock, the shock pressure is much larger than the unshocked pressure z≫1. Combining Eqs. (48) and (49) in this limit yields the relation between the shock position, free-fall velocity, and shocked-shell velocity
where R_{k} is the shock position and U_{ff} denotes the velocity in the free falling (unshocked) shell. The strong shock limit of Eq. (50) yields
where ρ_{ff} denotes the free-falling velocity and P_{ss} denotes the shocked-shell pressure. Finally, Eq. (48) gives a relation for the shocked shell pressure in terms of R_{k}, ρ_{ff}, and U_{ff}
D. Hot-spot energy
The energy conservation in the hot-spot is given by
where ρ,T,U,andp, respectively, denote the hot-spot density, temperature, velocity, and pressure. Here, γ=5/3 is the adiabatic index of an ideal gas. The first term on the right-hand side represents heat transport caused by thermal conduction with κ=κ_{0}T^{5/2} as the Spitzer thermal conductivity. The second term represents heating from alpha-particle deposition in the plasma, where the fraction of alpha-particles absorbed in the hot-spot is denoted by θαtot, n_{d} and n_{t} denote the number density of deuterons and tritons, respectively, 〈σv〉 is the fusion reactivity, and ε_{α} = 3.5 MeV is the energy of each alpha particle. Here, 〈σv〉≡C_{α}T^{3.7}, where C_{α}≈3.3×10^{−26}m^{3}s^{−1}keV^{−3.7} between 2<T<9 keV with 20% accuracy [22,31].
In this model, we assume that the alphas do not leave the global energy balance (θαtot=1). This assumption was first argued by Atzeni and Caruso in Ref [32]. The alphas that are not directly absorbed by the neutron-producing regions of the hot-spot are recycled in via mass ablation of the inner shell surface since alphas have a short range in the dense shell. This was checked by calculating the absorbed fraction of alpha particles directly from a 1-D LILAC simulation ensemble. In simulations, the hot-spot mass at bang time (time of peak neutron production) and the alpha energy deposited into this Lagrangian mass up to bang time are computed. The position of this Lagrangian mass R_{L}(t) is defined such that for all time
At bang time, R_{L} is defined as the trajectory where the density is one half of the sum of the peak density and the central hot-spot density {ρ(R_{L})≡0.5[ρ_{max}+ρ(0)]}. The fraction of alpha particles absorbed in the hot spot energy balance is then calculated by dividing the energy deposited into the hot-spot mass by the total number of alphas deposited in the entire simulation. The total alpha energy deposited into the hot-spot by bang time is considered in this calculation as follows:
where jαabsorbed is the alpha energy absorbed per unit volume per unit time and jαemitted is the alpha energy emitted per unit volume per unit time. Slight differences between jαemitted and ε_{α}n_{d}n_{t}〈σv〉 will occur due to the fact that it takes the alphas a finite amount of time to be stopped after they are born. In Fig. 7, the θαtot calculations are presented as a function of the yield amplification. It is evident in this figure that between 95% and 100% of the alpha particles are deposited into the hot-spot mass; therefore, we take θαtot=1.
Assuming that there is an even mixture of deuterons and tritons, we can write n_{d}n_{t}=ni2/4 where n_{i} is the ion number density. This can be related to both pressure and temperature from the ideal-gas equation of state n_{i}=p/2T. Notice that in the equation of state, we assumed n_{e}≈n_{i} and T_{e}≈T_{i} where n_{e} is the electron number density, T_{e} is the electron temperature, and T_{i} is the ion temperature. At typical hot-spot temperatures and densities, it is safe to assume that the plasma is fully ionized and that the electron and ion temperatures are equilibrated. The last term represents radiation losses from the hot-spot, where 1−θradtot is the fraction that escapes and F is the total radiation flux. The radiation flux is evaluated using the classical formula for bremsstrahlung emissivity j∼ni2T and F(r)=r^{−2}∫0rj(r)r^{2}dr, where j=C_{br}Phs2T^{−3/2} and C_{br}≈1.3×10^{−29}mJ^{5/2}s^{−1}N^{−2}, where the gaunt factor from Ref [33] is used and the pressure is in N, T is in joules, and j is in W/m{3} [34,35]. The parameter θradtot is the fraction of radiation reabsorbed in the hot-spot at bang time. Similar to the way θαtot was calculated, θradtot is computed by calculating the total amount of radiation absorbed by the fixed hot-spot mass boundary up to bang time and dividing by the total amount of radiation that has been emitted by the hot-spot as follows:
where jradabsorbed is the total radiation energy absorbed per unit volume per unit time and jrademitted is the radiation energy emitted per unit volume per unit time. In Fig. 8, it is evident that θradtot lies between 0.6 and 1. It is important to note that θradtot includes the radiation escaping through the hot-spot boundary and absorbed within a thin layer of the dense shell. Such a thin shell is subsequently ablated, thus recycling the absorbed radiation energy into the hot-spot. In Appendix A, radiation deposition within the hot-spot is analyzed by obtaining an analytical solution to the radiation transport equation in local thermodynamic equilibrium. The intention of this calculation is to show that the hot-spot is optically thin near the center of the hot spot, but it becomes increasingly opaque near the boundary.
Integrating Eq. (54) in radial coordinates over the entire hot-spot volume, we arrive at
where C_{0}≡C_{α}∫01T̃{1.7}x^{2}dx≈6.56×10^{−27}m^{3}keV^{−3.7}s^{−1} and μ_{0}≡∫01T̃{−3/2}x^{2}dx≈0.67. Here, we have neglected the hot-spot kinetic energy since the flow is subsonic in the limit of small Mach^{2}. Following the analysis from Refs [15–18], the leakage of energy caused by thermal conduction outside the hot-spot boundary was also neglected since the temperature and therefore the thermal conductivity in the cold shell are negligible. The term P_{ss}(R,t)≈P_{hs}(R,t), as previously shown from the velocity derivative derivation. The second term on the left-hand side will also be neglected since dR/dt−U_{ss}(R,t)=V_{a}∼Mach^{2}V_{i}.
Now by dividing the energy equation by 2πP_{s}V_{i}Rs2, we arrive at the final equation for the hot-spot energy
Here, γ_{α}=C_{0}ε_{α}P_{s}R_{s}T*1.7/(8V_{i}) and β=2C_{br}μ_{0}P_{s}R_{s}/(V_{i}T*3/2) are proportional to the ratio of alpha energy and radiation energy to the hot-spot internal energy (from the thin-shell adiabatic model). In Eq. (59), the left-hand side represents the total hot-spot internal energy. The first term on the right-hand side is the PdV work delivered to the hot-spot resulting from compression. The second term is the energy gain from alphas, and the third term on the right-hand side represents the radiation losses. Typical values of (1−θradtot)β range between 0.1 and 0.4, as seen in Fig. 9. Similar to how Mach^{2} is calculated, β is calculated by computing ϵ_{0} from the simulation ensemble at the beginning of the deceleration phase and estimating P_{s}, R_{s}, V_{i}, and T_{*} needed to calculate β.
E. Hot-spot mass
The hot-spot temperature is governed by the ablation process at the hot-spot - shell interface. Thermal conduction, radiation, and alpha particles can heat up the shell's inner surface and ablate material back in, thereby reducing the hot-spot temperature. This process is described by the mass conservation in the hot-spot
where ṁ=ρ_{ss}(R,t)V_{a} is the hot-spot mass ablation rate. This quantity is determined by heating of the shell boundary caused thermal conduction, alpha particle heating, and radiation heating [36]. The simplest way to calculate the mass ablation rate is to adopt a zeroth-order model for the hot-spot where the temperature, pressure, and density are constant in space. Then, a sharp boundary model can be applied to determine the mass ablation rate. The subsonic jump condition at the hot-spot interface is given by
where w=dR/dt−U(R,t), F_{rad} and F_{α} denote the radiation and alpha-particle fluxes leaving the hot-spot, and r_{rad} and r_{α} denote the remaining fraction of the radiation that exists at the boundaries. Here
where θradtot is the amount of radiation absorbed in the hot-spot mass and θradabl is the fraction of reabsorbed radiation energy, which contributes to mass ablation of the hot-spot. For r > R, some fraction 1−θradtot of the radiation escapes the global energy balance of the hot-spot. For r < R, a fraction θradabl of the reabsorbed radiation has been recycled back into the hot-spot caused by mass ablation. The flux at r=R^{−} is the sum of the flux leaving the hot-spot, 1−θradtot, and the flux that is reabsorbed due to ablation, θradablθradtot. The parameter θradabl is computed exactly in the LILAC simulations by considering how much radiation is deposited in the mass that is ablated into the hot-spot between the onset of the deceleration phase and bang time. The hot-spot radius R_{hs}(t) is defined at each time as the trajectory [7] where the density is one half of the sum of the maximum density and the central hot-spot density. The radiation absorbed between the hot-spot radius and the final bang time mass is then computed at each time step. The parameter θradabl is then calculated as the radiated energy deposited into this ablated mass divided by the total amount of radiation that has been absorbed by the hot-spot mass at bang time
In Fig. 10, the parameter θradabl as computed from the 1-D simulation ensemble is plotted as a function of the yield amplification. Approximately 10% to 50% of the reabsorbed radiation is recycled back into the hot-spot from ablation. This is consistent with the results from Ref [36].
For alpha particles
where θαabl denotes the fraction of absorbed alpha particles that are recycled back into the hot-spot due to mass ablation. For r > R, there are no alpha particles leaving the global energy balance, as was shown in Fig. 7. In Fig. 11, the fraction of alpha particles which contribute to hot-spot mass ablation θαabl is plotted as a function of the yield amplification. The fraction of absorbed alphas is computed in the same fashion as θradabl, where the number of alphas deposited into the unablated mass is divided by the total number of alpha particles absorbed into the hot-spot mass at bang time
This number is less than 0.1 for most of the targets, which suggests that the hot-spot has absorbed most of the alphas before they arrive at the inner shell boundary.
The alpha-particle flux can be written by integrating the alpha power over volume and dividing by surface area
The integral C_{0}≡C_{α}∫01x^{2}T̃{1.7}dx is used to simplify the expression. Likewise, the radiation particle flux is written as
where μ_{0}≡∫01T̃{−3/2}x^{2}dx. The jump in alpha-particle flux is simply [r_{α}F_{α}]R^{−}R^{+}=−θαablF_{α}(R,τ) and the jump in radiation flux is [r_{α}F_{rad}]R^{−}R^{+}=−θradablθ_{rad}F_{rad}(R,τ). The jump in heat flux is approximately [κ_{0}T^{5/2}∂T/∂r]R^{−}R^{+}≈−κ_{0}T07/24/7 since the temperature in the shell is much smaller than the temperature in the hot-spot and T̃{5/2}∂T̃/∂r̂|{r̂=1}=4/7.
Using the ideal gas equation of state, the term [5pw/2]R^{−}R^{+}=−5ṁ[T]R^{−}R^{+}/m_{i}, where m_{i} is the ion mass, ṁ=ρ_{ss}(R,t)V_{a}=ρ_{hs}(R,t)V_{blowoff} is the hot-spot mass ablation rate, V_{a} is the ablation velocity (velocity at which ablaton front penetrates the shell), and V_{blowoff} is the blowoff velocity (velocity at which ablated material is ejected into the hot-spot). The jump in temperature in this term is a Mach^{2} correction that will not be included in this model. Therefore
where a zeroth-order model is being adopted for this term to avoid the singularity in temperature. This is the limit of infinite thermal conduction, where the temperature profile in the hot-spot is flat and the ablation-front thickness goes to zero. It follows that the mass ablation rate from the energy equation jump condition becomes
The hot-spot mass is calculated by integrating the density over the volume M_{hs}=∫0R4πρr^{2}dr, where ρ=m_{i}p/2T. Defining μ_{1}≡∫01x^{2}T̃{−1}dx≈0.51, the dimensionless hot-spot mass conservation equation is
where T_{*}=[35μ1ViPsRs/(8κ0)]{2/7}.
F. Shocked-shell mass
The equation governing the shocked-shell mass is obtained from a straightforward integration of mass conservation from the hot-spot boundary to the shock position
This equation essentially balances the change in shocked mass with the mass flow in and out of its boundaries. The first term is the increase in mass resulting from shock propagation through the shell, while the second term represents the decrease in shell mass caused by ablation from thermal conduction, alpha-heating, and radiation heating. Notice that U_{ss}(R,t)−dR/dt=−V_{a}. In the limit V_{a}≪V_{i}, the mass ablated off of the inner shell surface can be neglected. In dimensionless form, Eq. (71) becomes
Here, the shocked-shell mass is normalized to the shell mass such that M̂{ss}=M_{ss}/M_{sh}. The shell density ρ_{ff}=[M_{sh}/(4πRs3)]ρ̂{ff} and the velocities are normalized to the implosion velocity. The density in the free-falling shell is evaluated by using a parabolic density profile in the free-falling shell of the form
where R_{outer} is the outer free-fall trajectory and R_{inner} is the inner free-fall trajectory. The density of the free-falling shell increases as the shell converges since M_{ff}∼Rinner2ρ_{ff}. From entropy conservation, p_{ff}∼ρff5/3 implies that the shell transfers kinetic energy into internal energy. We neglect this effect for simplicity here. The free-fall shell is unaware of the large hot-spot pressure and simply implodes inward at the implosion velocity V_{i} with an initial thickness Δ_{0}. This introduces a new dimensionless parameter into the system: A_{0}=R_{0}/Δ_{0}, which is the initial aspect ratio at the beginning of the deceleration phase. The 1-D simulation ensemble indicates that A_{0} varies roughly between 2 and 5, as shown in Fig. 12. The aspect ratio is calculated at the time of peak kinetic energy. The shell thickness is the difference between the hot-spot radius and the position where the shell density reduces to half of its peak value.
The velocity profile in the free-falling shell is not constant since the shell will expand outward because of the absence of applied pressure after the laser turns off. If the difference between the inner and outer surface velocity is given by ΔV, then R_{inner}(t)=R_{0}−V_{in}t and R_{outer}(t)=R_{0}+Δ_{0}−(V_{in}−ΔV)t, where V_{in} is the velocity of the inner free-falling shell surface. Assuming the velocity profile in the free-falling shell is linear, we have
The velocity V_{in} is then chosen in such a way that M_{sh}Vi2/2=12∫R_{inner}R_{outer}4πr^{2}ρ_{ff}(r,t)U_{ff}(r,t){2}dr. This equation is satisfied if the following condition is met:
The hydro profiles from Eqs. (73) and (74) can then be used in Eq. (72) to solve for the shocked-shell mass.
G. Shocked shell momentum balance
Integrating the momentum conservation equation from the inner shell surface R^{+} up to the shock position in the free-fall shell Rk+, we find a general expression for the shocked shell momentum
Here, M_{ss}≡∫RR_{k}4πρr^{2}dr is the shocked shell mass and 〈U_{ss}〉≡∫RR_{k}4πρU_{ss}r^{2}dr/M_{ss} denotes the mass-averaged shocked shell velocity. The first two terms on the right-hand side represent the pressure forces acting on the shocked shell from the hot-spot and the free-fall shell. In the strong shock limit, the free-fall pressure is negligible with respect to the shell pressure. The third term is integrating the pressure force throughout the shell length. It arises in spherical geometry and accounts for the fact that pressure affects the momentum balance through pressure gradients and not through increases in surface area. The last two terms represent the flow of momentum in and out of the shocked-shell surface. The last term represents momentum flowing out of the shell boundary caused by mass ablation from hot-spot thermal conduction, radiation, and alpha-heating. The second to last term is the increase in momentum resulting from the increase in shocked shell mass. The last term is negligible since it represents the change in shell momentum due to mass flow across the hot-spot boundary. It is smaller than the momentum flow through the shock front by a factor of roughly V_{a}/V_{i}, and is therefore another Mach^{2} effect. This term represents the rocket effect of hot-spot ablation on the shell.
To calculate the hot-spot trajectory from Eq. (76), hydro profiles for the shocked-shell density and velocity should be used. For simplicity here, the mass-averaged shocked-shell velocity is estimated by taking the average between the velocity at the hot-spot and at the shock front
where the velocity derivative from Eq. (47) was used to estimate the outer-edge velocity. The pressure profile in the shocked shell is assumed to be linear with radius
In dimensionless form, the shell's momentum conservation equation then reduces to
where P̂{ss}=P_{ss}/P_{s} is normalized to the hot-spot adiabatic stagnation pressure.
H. Solution of the model
The alpha-heating model is summarized by the following five equations for the hot-spot radius R̂, pressure P̂, temperature T̂, shock position R̂{k}, and shocked-shell mass M̂{ss}:
The initial conditions are P̂(0)=ϵ0−5/2,T̂(0)=ϵ01/2,R̂(0)=ϵ01/2,R̂{k}(0)=1.05R̂(0),M̂{ss}(0)=0,andR̂′(0)=−1. Equations (79)–(83) are solved numerically using γ_{α}=0,β=0.3,γ_{s}=5/3,θradtot=0.2,θradabl=0.4,ΔV̂=0.5, and θαabl=0.0 to obtain the hot-spot pressure, volume, temperature, and yield without the effect of alpha-heating. Choosing ΔV̂=0.5 gives rise to a shocked-shell mass of ∼0.6 at bang time, consistent with the stagnated mass from no-alpha simulations. The no-alpha solution is shown in Fig. 13 where smooth shocked-shell and hot-spot trajectories are shown. When the return shock reaches the outer shell surface, both R̂{k} and R̂ move at a constant velocity dR̂{k}/dτ=V̂{in}−ΔV̂. In Fig. 13, the analytical solution without alpha-heating is compared two 1-D LILAC simulations of two different implosions, using the ϵ_{0} and A_{0} calculated from the simulation. The shock trajectory is defined where the pressure gradient is maximized, the outer surface as the Lagrangian trajectory where density drops to 1/e of its maximum value at the time of peak kinetic energy, and the hot-spot radius as the Lagrangian trajectory where the density is one-half of the difference between the peak density and the central density. Excellent agreement between the two solutions is observed until the shock breaks out of the outer shell surface. After this point, the shell rapidly decompresses and a rarefaction wave is launched into the shell. For simplicity, this effect is not captured by the analytical model.
Alpha-heating from the compressible-shell model is then studied by increasing the parameter γ_{α}. As the alpha-heating parameter γ_{α} increases, several modifications to the hydrodynamics occur, which are illustrated in Fig. 14. In Fig. 14(a), the hot-spot energy is plotted as a function of time with and without alpha-heating. The solution with alpha-heating achieves a total yield amplification of 9.7 (at γ_{α}=14.4), and it follows the no-alpha solution until a critical time after which the hot-spot energy increases because alpha-heating. The bang time (time of peak neutron production) is τ=7.4 for the no-alpha solution and τ=8.8 for the with-alpha solution, in agreement with the times of peak hot-spot energy. This happens because the alpha-heating power increases the hot-spot energy after stagnation.
In Fig. 14(b), the hot-spot radius with and without alpha-heating is plotted as a function of time. In this figure, it is evident that the implosion with alpha-heating stagnates earlier and at a larger hot-spot radius. This occurs because the increase in hot-spot pressure caused by alpha-heating increases the deceleration force experienced by the shell, leading to an earlier stagnation. The larger hot-spot pressure also drives a more rapid expansion of the hot-spot after stagnation compared to the no-alpha implosion. Also, the bang time is delayed with respect to stagnation since alpha-heating increases the hot-spot energy during the expansion phase. At large levels of alpha-heating, the pdV work delivered to the hot-spot at bang time is negligible compared to the alpha energy. It is for this reason that the stagnation PdV work is used in the definition of the burning-plasma parameter Qαhs=0.5E_{α}/pdV_{stag} from Ref [11]. The PdV work delivered at stagnation is the maximum energy delivered to the hot-spot from pure hydrodynamic compression. However, we still retain half of the total alpha energy in Qαhs since bang time is the time when the alpha-heating rate is maximized.
When γ_{α} exceeds some critical value γ_{c}, the alpha-heating dominates the hot-spot energy balance and a singularity in the pressure is observed. Similar to the simple transient model from Eq. (6), the hot-spot energy continues to increase without bound when the alpha-heating is sufficiently dominant in the power balance. This critical value of γ_{α} can depend on β, A_{0}, ϵ_{0}, and the hot-spot temperature, which dictates the scaling of the fusion reactivity with temperature (i.e., 〈σv〉∼T^{ν}). This allows one to define χ_{noα}≡γ_{α}/γ_{c}(β,A_{0},ϵ_{0},ν), where χ_{noα}>1 implies ignition.
For sub-ignited capsules where χ_{noα}<1, the burning plasma regime can be studied by considering the yield amplification caused by alpha-heating and its relation to the burning plasma parameter Qαhs=0.5E_{α}/PdV_{stag}. From the analytical model, Qαhs is computed exactly by following the position of the hot-spot radius as follows:
where τ_{stag} is the time when dR̂/dτ=0. Likewise, the yield amplification is computed by taking the ratio of neutron yields with and without alpha-heating
In Fig. 15, the yield amplification is plotted as a function of Qαhs. This result is in good agreement with the curve from Ref [11] since the onset of the burning plasma regime requires a yield amplification of ∼4. It should be noted that the solution here is somewhat different from Betti et_al in Ref [11]. In that work, a compressible shell model similar to Eqs. (79)–(83) is used for comparison with the result of radiation hydrodynamic simulations. The model presented here includes additional physics such as the expansion of the free-falling shell, realistic initial conditions that are consistent with radiation–hydrodynamic simulations, and more accurate values for θαabl,θradtot, and θradabl from comparison with simulations.
V. CONCLUSIONS
In summary, we have presented a simple semi-analytical model of the compressible shell during the deceleration phase for the purpose of studying the effects of alpha-heating on implosion hydrodynamics. This model includes the physics of shell expansion, alpha-heating, radiation transport, and realistic initial conditions derived from the results of detailed radiation–hydrodynamic simulations to correctly capture the physics of alpha and radiation deposition in the hot-spot and inner shell layer. In particular, we find that most of the alpha energy (∼90%) is deposited directly inside the hot-spot, while a small fraction (∼10%) drives mass ablation off the inner shell surface and its energy is recycled back into the hot-spot. Of the bremsstrahlung radiation emission, ∼40% is deposited in the hot-spot, ∼40% is recycled back in the hot-spot by ablation off the shell, and ∼20% leaves the hot-spot. The solution of the analytical model is in very good agreement with radiation–hydrodynamic simulations of direct-drive implosions. The application of this analytical model to the analysis of alpha-heating metrics will be the subject of a forthcoming publication.
APPENDIX A: ABSORPTION OF RADIATION IN THE HOT SPOT
It has been commonly assumed in many ICF models that the hot-spot is optically thin to the bremssstrahlung xrays it emits [10,20]. Here, we present analytical calculations that show that the hot-spot is optically thick near the boundary. We first begin by considering an implosion that achieves hot-spot conditions of 320 Gbar, a 31 μm hot-spot radius, and a 4.2-keV neutron-averaged hot-spot temperature. The simulated fraction of reabsorbed radiation computed using the technique described in Sec. IV D is ∼28%.
The absorption of radiation by the hot-spot is checked analytically here by solving the steady-state radiative transport equation in radial coordinates
where F_{ν} is the radially directed radiation flux (power per area per frequency) under the assumption of an isotropically emitting source, ε_{ν} is the bremsstrahlung emissivity (emitted power per unit volume per unit frequency), and κ_{ν} is the opacity (inverse mean free path for a photon of frequency ν). In this equation, we have assumed that the radiation field is varying slowly in time and that scattering effects may be neglected. The general solution to this equation is
where τ is the optical depth given by
and the emissivity is given by
where C_{br}=6.84×10^{35} in CGS units, n_{e} is the electron number density, n_{i} is the ion number density, T is the electron temperature, and g_{ff} is the gaunt factor that accounts for quantum mechanical effects calculated from Ref [37]. In local thermodynamic equilibrium, ε_{ν}=κ_{ν}B_{ν}(T), where B_{ν}(T)=2hν^{3}c^{−2}(ehν/T−1){−1} is the Planckian blackbody spectrum.
Using the hydrodynamic profiles for density and temperature at bang time from the simulation, this model can be used to calculate the emission and absorption of radiation within the hot-spot. The hot-spot–radiated power density is simply given by
The net radiation power density is then given by
In Fig. 16, both j_{rad} and j_{net} are plotted as a function of radius. They are compared with the results from LILAC simulations which utilize astrophysical opacity tables. In this figure, it is evident that this simple model overestimates the emissivity in the dense shell. Although there are quantitative differences between this simple model and the exact calculation, it is clear that most of the emission and absorption occur near the edge of the hot-spot where the mass density is highest.
The radiation flux leaving through a surface 4πr^{2} can be computed as a function of radius. This is accomplished by integrating the net radiated power over the volume of the sphere it encloses and dividing by the total emission from this sphere
In Fig. 17, the fraction of leaked radiation is plotted as a function of radius. It is clear that the fraction of reabsorbed radiation is sensitive to the definition of the hot-spot boundary. The important thing to note is that most of the radiation is not reabsorbed in the middle of the hot-spot. Many of the emitted photons are reabsorbed, however, near the shell boundary where the temperature is low and the density is high. It is for this reason that the fraction of radiation escaping the hot-spot energy balance is of the order of ∼30%.
FIG. 1. 
The pressure from Eq. (10) as a function of the hot-spot volume. The blue regions represent the condition χ_{noα}<1, where the pressure decays as the volume expands since the alpha-heating is not enough to overcome expansion losses. For χ_{noα}=1, the alpha-heating is exactly balanced by the expansion losses and the pressure remains constant. The red region, where χ_{noα}>1, represents the ignited region where the pressure increases without bound since the alpha-heating rate is larger than the plasma-expansion rate.
FIG. 2. 
The yield amplification calculated as a function of Q_{α}. The black curve is the analytical hot-spot model approximated by Ŷ{amp}≈1+1.9Q_{α}; the red curve is the simple steady-state model with μ≈0.4.
FIG. 3. 
Illustration of the compressible-shell model. During the deceleration phase, the shell is divided into two parts by the position of the return shock at r = R_{k}. The shocked shell has been impulsively decelerated by the shock and compresses the hot-spot like a piston. The unshocked part is unaware of the hot-spot pressure and free falls inward at the initial implosion velocity V_{i}.
FIG. 4. 
The simple adiabatic thin-shell model from Eqs. (32) and (33) with ϵ_{0}=100. The radius is normalized to its initial value, the pressure is normalized to its stagnation value, and τ̂ is the time normalized to the bang time. The hot-spot pressure increases adiabatically as the thin shell converges inward.
FIG. 5. 
The initial parameter ε_{0} represents the ratio of shell kinetic energy to hot-spot internal energy at the beginning of the deceleration phase. It varies between 20 and 100 for an ensemble of simulations.

The hot-spot Mach number, as used in the analytical model, computed for a large ensemble of ICF targets as a function of the yield enhancement caused by alpha-heating. The Mach number is less than 10% for most implosions except for the higher adiabat α∼4to5 implosions that have Mach^{2}∼10%to15%.
FIG. 7. 
The fraction of alpha-particle energy deposited within the hot-spot mass until bang time plotted as a function of the yield amplification for the 1-D simulation ensemble. These results indicate that nearly 100% of alphas are deposited in the hot-spot mass at bang time. The highest adiabat target (α∼5) has the smallest hot-spot areal density and still absorbs more than 80% of alphas.
FIG. 8. 
The fraction of radiation reabsorbed in the global hot-spot energy balance lies between 50% and 100%. The highest-adiabat (lowest hot-spot areal density) implosions have more leakage of radiation compared to higher areal-density ensembles.
FIG. 9. 
Typical values of the radiation parameter (1−θ_{rad,tot})β lie between 0.1 and 0.4 in ICF targets.
FIG. 10. 
The fraction of absorbed radiation deposited into the ablated mass lies between 0.1 and 0.5.
FIG. 11. 
The fraction of alpha particles which contribute to mass ablation is generally less than 10%.
FIG. 12. 
The initial aspect ratio of the simulation ensemble indicates values of R_{0}/Δ_{0} between 2 and 5.
FIG. 13. 
The shell trajectories from the compressible-shell model equations (79)–(83) without alpha-heating (γ_{α}=0) are shown as dashed lines, with actual simulation calculations shown in solid lines. The time t is the difference between the simulation time and the time of peak kinetic energy. Around τ∼2, the jump in radius is caused by the stagnation shock hitting the shell. (a) comparison of the analytical model with an α∼0.5 implosion which achieves an implosion velocity of 307 km/s, shell kinetic energy of 12 kJ, A_{0}=3.6, and ϵ_{0}=85. (b) An α∼4 implosion with V_{i}=524 km/s, a kinetic energy of 18 kJ, ϵ_{0}=38, and A_{0}=3.8.
FIG. 14. 
The blue curve is the solution to Eqs. (79)–(83) with alpha-heating (γ_{α}=14.3, Y_{amp} = 9.7), while the red curve is the solution with γ_{α}=0. The solutions are compared in (a), where the hot-spot energy is plotted as a function of time, and (b) where the hot-spot radius is plotted as a function of time. These solutions are obtained using A_{0}=4 and ϵ_{0}=60.
FIG. 15. 
The yield amplification calculated as a function of Q_{α} using A_{0}=4 and ϵ_{0}=60. This curve is in general agreement with the simple model from earlier and indicates the onset of the first burning-plasma regime requires a yield amplification of approximately 4.
FIG. 16. 
The hot-spot emission and absorption profiles as a function of radius for an example simulation. The blue curve represents the frequency-integrated emissivity j_{rad}, while the solid red represents the net radiative power j_{net}. The dashed curves are the results from the LILAC simulation at bang time, while the solid curves represent the analytical solution from Eq. (A2).
FIG. 17. 
The fraction of radiation leaving the hot-spot as a function of the hot-spot radius.
