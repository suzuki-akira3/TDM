Diffusivity of the interstitial hydrogen shallow donor in In_{2}O_{3}
Hydrogen has been found to be an n-type dopant in In_{2}O_{3} that gives rise to unintentional conductivity. An infrared (IR) absorption line observed at 3306 cm^{−1} has been assigned to the H_{i}^{+} center. Two types of experiments have been performed to determine the diffusivity of H_{i}^{+} in In_{2}O_{3} from its IR absorption spectra. (i) At temperatures near 700 K, the O-H line at 3306 cm^{−1} has been used to determine the diffusivity of H_{i}^{+} from its in-diffusion and out-diffusion behaviors. (ii) At temperatures near 160 K, stress has been used to produce a preferential alignment of the H_{i}^{+} center that has been detected in IR absorption experiments made with polarized light. With the help of theory, the kinetics with which a stress-induced alignment can be produced yield the time constant for a single jump of the H_{i}^{+} center and also the diffusivity of H_{i}^{+} near 160 K. The combination of the diffusivity of H_{i}^{+} found near 700 K by mass-transport measurements and that found near 160 K from the time constant for a single H_{i}^{+} jump determines the diffusivity for H_{i}^{+} over eleven decades!
I. INTRODUCTION
In_{2}O_{3} is a transparent conducting oxide that finds broad application in flat-panel displays and as transparent electrodes for electronic devices such as light emitting diodes and solar cells [1,2]. While In_{x}Sn_{1-x}O (ITO) is a commonly used conducting film, hydrogen impurities have also been found to be an important source of n-type conductivity in In_{2}O_{3}. Theory predicts that both interstitial hydrogen (H_{i}) and hydrogen trapped at an oxygen vacancy can be shallow donors [3]. Implanted muons, whose properties mimic those of hydrogen, have also been found to form shallow donors in In_{2}O_{3} [4]. Furthermore, In_{2}O_{3}:H can be used to fabricate conductive films with greater transparency than ITO in the infrared (IR) region of the spectrum and has attracted attention for solar-cell applications [5–7].
In_{2}O_{3} has the cubic bixbyite structure with a conventional unit cell that contains 80 atoms [1]. Reference  [3] provides details about the bixbyite structure. A vibrational line seen at 3306 cm^{−1} (Fig. 1) for samples treated in an H_{2} ambient was found to be correlated with the infrared (IR) absorption due to the free carriers that were also produced by the hydrogen treatment [8]. The 3306 cm^{−1 }line has been assigned to the lowest energy O-H antibonding configuration, AB_{01}, for H_{i}^{+} predicted by theory [Fig. 2(a)] [3,8]. (There are three additional metastable antibonding hydrogen sites associated with each oxygen atom.) Subsequent IR absorption experiments performed in conjunction with applied uniaxial stresses revealed a C_{1h} symmetry for the 3306 cm^{−1} defect, supporting this assignment [9].
Our recent research on the H_{i}^{+} center in In_{2}O_{3} has helped us to develop strategies for measuring its diffusivity with vibrational spectroscopy [9]. In the present paper, the diffusivity of H_{i}^{+} in In_{2}O_{3} single crystals is determined over a range greater than 11 decades from the hydrogen-diffusion profiles investigated in mass transport experiments and from the time constant for single hydrogen jumps investigated in stress-alignment experiments. We emphasize that the study of the 3306 cm^{−1 }line lets us make diffusion measurements specific to the isolated H_{i}^{+} shallow donor without contributions from other hydrogen defects in In_{2}O_{3}.
II. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE
The In_{2}O_{3} samples used in our experiments were bulk single crystals grown in an air ambient by the flux method [10] at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) [11]. Samples for mass transport measurements were approximately 3 × 3 × 1 mm^{3} in size. Samples were annealed in sealed quartz ampoules that contained H_{2} (2/3 atm) to introduce hydrogen. Any additional annealing treatments were performed in a tube furnace in a flowing N_{2} ambient.
To fabricate In_{2}O_{3} samples for the application of uniaxial stresses, single crystals were selected that were especially large in size (typically bigger than 5 × 5 × 2 mm^{3}). Laue back-reflection X-ray scattering was used to show that crystals had {100} faces, making it possible for us to prepare samples with either a [001] or [110] long axis for stress experiments. The as-grown crystals already contained hydrogen and showed the 3306 cm^{−1 }line assigned to H_{i} [see spectrum (ii) in Fig. 1].
IR absorption spectra were measured with a Bomem DA.3 Fourier transform spectrometer equipped with a KBr beamsplitter and an InSb detector. For measurements performed at 77 K without stress, samples were cooled in a Helitran cryostat. For measurements made under stress, uniaxial stresses were applied with a push rod apparatus that was cooled in a variable-temperature Oxford CF 1204 cryostat. The probing light was polarized with a wire grid polarizer that was placed in the IR beam path after the cryostat.
III. DIFFUSIVITY OF HYDROGEN IN IN_{2}O_{3}
The diffusivity of hydrogen in In_{2}O_{3} can be determined from its in-diffusion and out-diffusion behavior [12–14]. For in-diffusion experiments, In_{2}O_{3} samples were hydrogenated by annealing in an H_{2} ambient at temperatures near 700 K. The diffusion depth of H_{i}^{+} was then determined by mechanically thinning a sample and monitoring the amount of H_{i} removed as a function of depth using measurements of the 3306 cm^{−1} IR line. An analysis of the H_{i}^{+} remaining, determined spectroscopically as the sample is thinned, yields the diffusivity.
The subsequent elimination of the 3306 cm^{−1 }line by thermal annealing in an inert ambient is governed by the out-diffusion of H_{i}^{+} [12,13]. Fick's second law has been used to model the time dependence of the decay of the 3306 cm^{−1 }line as a function of the annealing temperature. A fit of the model to the decay of H_{i}^{+} upon annealing also yields the diffusivity.
The In_{2}O_{3} crystals being grown at ORNL for our experiments are large enough to enable IR absorption measurements made in conjunction with applied uniaxial stresses. Defects with symmetries lower than the site symmetry of a host crystal have several crystallographically equivalent orientations [15,16]. Low temperature IR absorption measurements made with polarized light as a function of the applied stress determine how the IR lines associated with orientationally degenerate defects are split. Stress experiments have determined that the H_{i}^{+} center giving rise to the 3306 cm^{−1 }line has C_{1h} symmetry [9,17]. Furthermore, under an applied stress, the differently oriented defects have different ground state energies, so the application of stress provides a strategy for producing a preferential alignment of a defect that can be detected by the absorption of polarized light [15,18]. For a defect that can be aligned, the kinetics of its reorientation in annealing experiments can be measured to investigate its motion [19]. Previous experiments have revealed the reorientational motion of the H_{i}^{+} center at a temperature of 165 K, and from the stress-induced alignment, its diffusivity at this low temperature [9]. In the present work, the stress alignment of H_{i}^{+} has been investigated at additional temperatures to confirm and refine our previous results.
A. In-diffusion profiles
Experiments have been performed to determine the in-diffusion profiles of H_{i}^{+} in In_{2}O_{3} samples following anneals in an H_{2} ambient. An as-grown sample was initially annealed at 1273 K for 2 h in flowing N_{2} to eliminate any H that might be present. There was no IR absorption due either to free carriers or O-H centers in our samples following this treatment. This sample was then annealed in a sealed ampoule containing 2/3 atm of H_{2} for 1 h at a temperature near 723 K to introduce hydrogen into a thin layer near the sample surface.
A thickness of 0.1 mm was lapped from one surface of the sample to completely remove H from that surface. For the other surface, layers were removed successively by lapping and polishing to measure the H_{i}^{+} depth profile. The sample thickness was measured with a micrometer as the sample was thinned in small steps. IR spectra [Fig. 3(a)] were measured to monitor the O-H vibrational absorption at 3306 cm^{−1} as layers were removed.
The integrated absorbance, A(d), of the 3306 cm^{−1 }line assigned to H_{i}^{+} decreased as the sample was thinned as is shown in Fig. 3(b). To determine D_{H}, the diffusivity of H_{i}^{+} at the in-diffusion temperature, these data were fit with the integral of a complementary error function vs. the thickness, d, of the layer removed [Eq. (1)]
The diffusivities determined for H_{i}^{+} at 723 and 698 K in this way are listed in Table I.
B. Out-diffusion of hydrogen
Once a thin hydrogenated layer in In_{2}O_{3} has been produced by an anneal in an H_{2} ambient, its subsequent elimination by thermal annealing in an inert ambient is governed by the out-diffusion of the H_{i}^{+} center [12,13]. Spectra of the 3306 cm^{−1 }line are shown in Fig. 4(a) for a sample initially hydrogenated by annealing in an H_{2} ambient (1 h at 698 K). Results are shown for increasing annealing times at T = 598 K. The integrated absorbance of the 3306 cm^{−1 }line vs. the annealing time at 598 K is shown in Fig. 4(b). This integrated absorbance, determined experimentally, is proportional to the areal density of the H_{i}^{+} center. Similar experiments were performed for a few additional annealing temperatures.
We have used Mathematica to solve numerically the differential equation given by Fick's Second Law to model the time dependence of the decay of the 3306 cm^{−1 }line for annealing in an inert ambient. The depth profile for the concentration of the H_{i}^{+} center, with an in-diffusion depth determined by our experimental study of the in-diffusion profile of H_{i}^{+}, is the starting point for a model of the out-diffusion behavior of H_{i}^{+}. (The starting in-diffusion profile was taken to have the functional form: erfc[x/2Dt]. The amplitude of the concentration profile was determined from the integrated absorbance of the 3306 cm^{−1 }line measured for a sample following its initial hydrogenation treatment and a calibration of the absorption strength of the 3306 cm^{−1} line determined previously [8]. The concentrations of H_{i}^{+} were taken to be zero at both sample boundaries.)
A numerical solution of Fick's Second Law yields the calculated depth profiles shown in Fig. 5(a) for increasing annealing times. To determine the areal density of H_{i}^{+} as a function of the annealing time in our model, the out-diffusion profiles shown in Fig. 5(a) were integrated numerically over the thickness of the sample to yield the decay of the H_{i}^{+} areal density shown by the line in Fig. 5(b).
The time dependence of the integrated absorbance of the 3306 cm^{−1 }line upon annealing could be fit well by our out-diffusion model, as shown in Fig. 5(b), for an annealing temperature of 673 K. To perform such a fit, the value of the diffusivity was adjusted to minimize the sum of the squares of the deviations between the measured data and the results of our diffusion model. Error bars were determined from the values of the diffusivity that increased the value of χ^{2}, which characterized the fit, by 1. Values of the diffusivity of H_{i}^{+} determined in this way and estimated uncertainties are shown in Table I.
C. Stress alignment
The vibrational line at 3306 cm^{−1} was investigated previously with polarized light under uniaxial stress to determine the symmetry of the H_{i}^{+} center [9]. The second derivatives of the measured spectra showed clear line splittings that were analyzed. The stress-induced splittings of the 3306 cm^{−1 }line were found to be consistent with C_{1h} symmetry. The two components of the 3306 cm^{−1 }line, b and c, that are split by stress are shown in Fig. 6(a) for a [001] stress and with the electric vector of the light perpendicular to the stress, E//[010].
When stress was applied at elevated temperatures (T ≈ 160 K), the relative intensities of the stress-split components of the 3306 cm^{−1 }line were changed due to a stress-induced alignment of the inequivalent components of the C_{1h} center [9]. The alignment produced by [001] stress occurs because the b and c orientations of the H_{i}^{+} center have different ground state energies under stress. These components are then populated according to their Boltzmann factors if sufficient time is allowed for equilibrium to be established.
Our previous experiments yielded a time constant for the alignment of the H_{i}^{+} center of τ^{*} = 1.3 ± 0.3 × 10^{3} s at 165 K [9]. Additional experiments have been performed to determine τ^{*} at other temperatures. Here, an In_{2}O_{3} sample was cooled to 77 K where a stress of 250 MPa was applied. The sample was then given a series of annealing treatments under stress at a constant elevated temperature to monitor the production of the stress alignment as a function of time. After each anneal under stress, the sample was cooled to 77 K so that a polarized IR spectrum could be measured to determine the alignment of the H_{i}^{+} center. A second-derivative spectrum is shown in Fig. 6(a) for an In_{2}O_{3} sample to which a [001] stress of 250 MPa had been applied at a low temperature (77 K) where alignment does not occur. A spectrum for the same sample, measured following a subsequent anneal for 120 min at 160 K under stress, is also shown. The intensity of component b is decreased by the anneal under stress while the component c is increased.
The stress alignment, σ_{T}, reported here  is defined to be proportional to the difference between the intensities of the b and c components normalized to their values measured initially at low temperature when no stress alignment had yet occurred [Eq. (2)]. [Our second-derivative spectra were fit with the sums of second derivatives of Lorentzian line shapes to determine the areas I_{⊥}(T) of the b and c components.]
The quantity σ_{T} is plotted vs. the annealing time in Fig. 6(b). The time dependence of σ_{T} was fit with first order kinetics to determine the time constant τ^{*} for the production of the stress-induced alignment.
The diffusivity of H_{i} is D_{H}=d^{2}/3τ_{0}, where τ_{0} is the time constant for jumps between specific low-energy H_{i} sites and d is the distance between sites [9,20]. The distance between nearest low-energy AB_{01} sites has been found by theory to be 3.003 Å [9]. Furthermore, the time constant for the production of defect alignment for the C_{1h}, H_{i}^{+} center under [001] stress is τ^{*}=τ_{0}/9 (Ref [20]), giving a diffusivity of D_{H}=d^{2}/27τ^{*}. The time constant τ^{*} for producing a stress-induced alignment determined by our experiments and the corresponding diffusivities of H_{i}^{+} are listed in Table II.
D. Diffusivity of H_{i}^{+} for over 11 decades
The diffusivities of H_{i}^{+} in In_{2}O_{3} determined for temperatures near 700 K by mass transport measurements are plotted in Fig. 7. The diffusivities determined for temperatures near 160 K by measurements of the H_{i}^{+} jump rate are also shown.
When the H_{i} doping concentration exceeds the intrinsic carrier concentration, n_{i}, at the diffusion temperature, an internal electric field that affects the diffusion process is set up by the ionized dopant and its resulting free carriers. For the simple case of an ionized dopant (H_{i}^{+} here), the apparent diffusivity is enhanced by a factor of
where N is the shallow dopant concentration [12,14,21,22]. The factor h has an upper bound of 2 that occurs when N≫n_{i}.
As-grown crystals of In_{2}O_{3}, similar to those used for our experiments on the H_{i}^{+} center under stress, were found to have high resistivity [11]. Our previous work showed negligible free-carrier absorption for as-grown In_{2}O_{3} samples, consistent with their high resistivity [8]. We concluded that the H_{i}^{+} centers in these samples were present at modest concentration (∼10^{17} cm^{−3}) throughout the bulk of the sample and that these H_{i}^{+} centers were compensated by other defects that were also present. In this case, the net free electron concentration is small and the diffusivity of H_{i}^{+} is not enhanced by an electric field arising from H_{i}^{+} and its associated free electrons.
In contrast to as-grown In_{2}O_{3}, the samples used for our in-diffusion and out-diffusion experiments were deliberately hydrogenated in an H_{2} ambient to produce thin, heavily doped layers. Hall measurements made in our previous work [8] showed that the concentration of free electrons introduced intentionally by annealing in an H_{2} ambient at a temperature near 723 K is greater than 10^{19} cm^{−3}. In this case, the concentration of free electrons introduced by H_{i} greatly exceeds the intrinsic carrier concentration for In_{2}O_{3}, yielding a value of h in Eq. (3) near its upper bound of 2.
The diffusivity of H_{i}^{+} near 700 K is plotted in Fig. 7, as measured, by filled squares. The value of the diffusivity, reduced by a factor of h = 2, is plotted with open circles to make an estimate of the value of D_{H} that would be observed in the absence of the field arising from H_{i}^{+} shallow donors and their associated free electrons. If we assume a value of h = 2 to determine D_{H} near 700 K, we obtain the following diffusivity for H_{i}^{+} (solid line in Fig. 7) [23]:
If we ignore the possible effect of an internal field on the diffusivity, we obtain an activation energy of E_{A} = 0.43 ± 0.01 eV and a prefactor of D_{0} = 4.2 ± 2 × 10^{−7} cm^{2}/s. The uncertainty in the activation energy for diffusion due to any uncertainty in the effect of an internal electric field on the diffusivity is small because of the 11 decade range over which D_{H} has been measured.
IV. DISCUSSION
The structure of the H_{i}^{+} center in In_{2}O_{3} and a mechanism for its diffusion have been investigated by hybrid density functional theory calculations that utilized the CRYSTAL06 code [24] with conditions as stated in Refs [8] and  [9]. Our previous work on the H_{i}^{+} center in In_{2}O_{3} predicted the mechanism for a diffusion jump of H_{i}^{+} in In_{2}O_{3} that is shown in Fig. 2 (Ref [9]). This diffusion jump is also the mechanism by which the H_{i}^{+} center can reorient under stress to become aligned. A low-energy AB_{01} site is shown in Fig. 2(a). The easiest hydrogen jump is to an equivalent AB_{01} partner site on an adjacent oxygen atom. However, this motion will be back-and-forth and will not give rise to long-range diffusion. For H_{i}^{+} to diffuse, it must migrate to an AB_{01} site that is external to the inner region of this cluster such as the one shown in Fig. 2(c). There are two such sites at a predicted distance of 3.003 Å from the initial AB_{01} site [9]. Other AB_{01} sites are more distant. A model in which an H_{i}^{+} jump, from the site shown in Fig. 2(a) to an AB_{01} site such as the one shown in Fig. 2(c), is the dominant diffusion mechanism, leads to the value for the diffusivity based on the H_{i}^{+} jump rate determined in Sec. III C above.
The diffusion pathway proposed by theory also predicts an activation energy for diffusion that can be compared with experiment. There are four inequivalent antibonding sites for H bonded to an oxygen atom in In_{2}O_{3} [3,8]. The site AB_{02} shown in Fig. 2(b) has a predicted energy that is 0.51 eV greater than that of AB_{01}. (The AB_{03} and AB_{04} sites have energies ∼0.8 eV greater than that of AB_{01}.) Theory suggests a diffusion process in which H_{i}^{+} moves from the AB_{01} site shown in Fig. 2(a) to the metastable site shown in Fig. 2(b). From this metastable configuration, H_{i}^{+} can rotate and move to another lowest energy AB_{01} site [Fig. 2(c)] to complete a two-step, diffusion jump. The activation energy of 0.42 eV for diffusion found by experiment is close to the energy difference of 0.51 eV between the AB_{01} and AB_{02} sites for H_{i}^{+} found by theory, supporting this proposed mechanism. (Implanted muons in In_{2}O_{3} have been found to have a site exchange energy of 0.46 eV, suggesting that motion of the muon in In_{2}O_{3} involves the same diffusion mechanism [25].)
The diffusivity of H_{i}^{+} measured with stress-induced alignment experiments near 160 K, when combined with mass-transport measurements of the diffusivity of H_{i}^{+} at 723 K, determines the diffusion constant of H_{i}^{+} for over eleven decades! Theory predicts a microscopic mechanism for a diffusion jump and the activation energy for diffusion similar to the results determined experimentally.
