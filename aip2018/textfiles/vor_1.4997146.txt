Quantum coherence generating power, maximally abelian subalgebras, and Grassmannian geometry
We establish a direct connection between the power of a unitary map in d-dimensions (d < ∞) to generate quantum coherence and the geometry of the set M_{d} of maximally abelian subalgebras (of the quantum system full operator algebra). This set can be seen as a topologically non-trivial subset of the Grassmannian over linear operators. The natural distance over the Grassmannian induces a metric structure on M_{d}, which quantifies the lack of commutativity between the pairs of subalgebras. Given a maximally abelian subalgebra, one can define, on physical grounds, an associated measure of quantum coherence. We show that the average quantum coherence generated by a unitary map acting on a uniform ensemble of quantum states in the algebra (the so-called coherence generating power of the map) is proportional to the distance between a pair of maximally abelian subalgebras in M_{d} connected by the unitary transformation itself. By embedding the Grassmannian into a projective space, one can pull-back the standard Fubini-Study metric on M_{d} and define in this way novel geometrical measures of quantum coherence generating power. We also briefly discuss the associated differential metric structures.
I. INTRODUCTION
The last few years have witnessed a renewed and strong interest in the quantitative theory of quantum coherence [1–4]. This has been partly motivated by the key role that this concept plays in quantum information processing [5], quantum metrology [6], quantum thermodynamics [7,8], and even in the so-called field of quantum biology [9]. A related natural question concerns with the ability of a quantum operation to generate quantum coherence. Different approaches have been explored in the literature to quantify the coherence generating power (CGP) of quantum operations [10–12]. For a thoughtful and comprehensive review of the current efforts on the theory of quantum coherence and CGP, see Ref [13]. Also, in Ref [14], one can find the most recent updates and progress on the resource theory of coherence, states, and beyond.
The goal of this paper is to develop some mathematical aspects of the approach to CGP for finite-dimensional quantum unital operations introduced in Refs [15] and  [16]. This is a probabilistic approach that builds on top of an analog strategy in the context of entanglement theory [17]. We shall unveil the underlying geometrical and algebraic structures to the CGP measures for unitary maps defined in Refs [15] and  [16]. More precisely, we will show how the formalism there introduced can be interpreted and generalized in terms of metric structures over the space of maximally abelian subalgebras (MASAs) of the algebra of operators (the latter being endowed with the Hilbert-Schmidt scalar product). The space of MASAs can be seen as a topologically non-trivial subset of the Grassmannian manifold of d–dimensional (d being the Hilbert space dimension) subspaces of the full operator algebra and thereby inherits the Grassmannian metric structure.
Quite remarkably, the quantitative notion of CGP introduced in Ref [15], on purely physical grounds, turns out to be exactly proportional to the induced distance over the space of MASAs. This distance, in turn, will be shown to quantitatively measure the lack of commutativity between pairs of MASAs. Finally by exploiting standard embeddings of the Grassmannian into projective spaces, we will show how to introduce novel measures of CGP for unitaries as well as to unveil the deep geometrical origin of known ones.
In Sec. II, we introduce the basic elements of the formalism, maximally abelian algebras, and quantum coherence, and discuss their elementary properties. In Sec. III, we establish the connection between CGP measures and the geometry of the Grassmannian over linear operators. In Sec. IV, we briefly analyze the associated differential metric structure. Section V contains the conclusions.
II. QUANTUM COHERENCE AND MAXIMALLY ABELIAN SUBALGEBRAS
Let H≅C^{d},(d<∞) be the complex Hilbert space associated with a d-dimensional quantum system. The algebra of linear operators L(H) is equipped with the Hilbert-Schmidt scalar product ⟨A, B⟩ ≔ tr(A^{†}B) and ‖X‖{2}≔⟨X,X⟩. In the following, when L(H) is thought of as an Hilbert space itself with respect to this scalar product, it will be denoted by H_{HS}≅C^{d2}.
In the physical literature, the notion of quantum coherence is usually formulated in relation to some distinguished orthonormal basis in the Hilbert space of the quantum system. However, in this paper, we find convenient for use a slightly more abstract approach. We start by providing a few basic definitions and associated elementary facts.
Definition 0. A family of orthogonal projectors B≔{Π_{i}}i=1m⊂L(H) is called an orthogonal resolution of the identity (ORI) if (a) Π_{i}Π_{j}=δ_{ij}Π_{j}, (b) ∑j=1mΠ_{j}=1, and (c) Πj†=Π_{j},∀j=1,2,…,m. If all the projectors are rank one (⇒m = d), we will say that B is a maximal orthogonal resolution of the identity (MORI).We would like to note that the concept of ORI was already used in the early work on quantification of coherence [19] in which several of the basic questions of the resulting theory (e.g., basic state transformations, and monotones) were answered. However, in this paper, the focus is on MORIs. The set of all ORIs over H has a natural partial order (B ≤ B′ iff B′ is a refinement [18] of B) for which the MORIs are indeed maximal elements. Any orthonormal frame (|i)i=1d in the Hilbert space defines a MORI, i.e., {Π_{i}≔|ii|}i=1d. A MORI on the other hand defines just an equivalence class of orthonormal frames where equivalent elements differ by permutations of the vectors and by U(1) phases. All the relevant notions and quantities of this paper depend just on the MORI (and not on the specific frame in the equivalence class).Let us next consider one of the main objects of this paper: the algebra of operators which are diagonal in the representation associated to any frame in the equivalence class of B.
Definition 1. Given a MORI B={Π_{i}}i=1d, we define the associated d-dimensional abelian subalgebra (ASA) of L(H) by A_{B}≔{∑j=1dλ_{j}Π_{j}/(λ_{j})j=1d∈C^{d}}⊂H_{HS}. The map
is an orthogonal projection (in H_{HS}) whose range is A_{B}.Clearly A_{B} is closed under Hermitian conjugation. At the physical level, the algebra projection D_{B} is the measurement map associated with the MORI B and it is a completely positive (CP) trace-preserving unital map i.e., D_{B}(1)=1. Crucially, the spaces A_{B} are maximal ASAs (MASAs) in the sense that they are not proper subalgebras of any other abelian one. This basically follows from the fact that the map B↦A_{B} between ORIs and subalgebras of L(H) is a morphism of partially ordered sets, i.e., B≤B^{′}⇒A_{B}⊂A_{B^{′}}.
Proposition 1. Let M_{d} denote the family of MASAs over H_{HS}.
(i) The correspondence B↦A_{B} is a bijection between the set of all MORIs and M_{d}.
(ii) The action U(d)×M_{d}→M_{d}:(U,A)↦U(A)≔{U(X)≔UXU^{†}/X∈A} is transitive. Moreover,
where S_{d} denotes the permutation group of d-objects.
Proof. (i) We have to show that (a) if B is a MORI then A_{B}∈M_{d} and (b) if A∈M_{d} then there exists a MORI B such that A=A_{B}. Moreover the correspondence B↦A_{B} is one-to-one.Let B=Π_{i}=|ii|i=1d and suppose A_{B}⊂A, where A is an abelian subalgebra of L(H). If X∈A, then [X,A]=0∀A∈A_{B}. In particular, AΠ_{i} = Π_{i}A ∀ i, whence A|i=i|A|i|i∀i. This shows that A is B-diagonal, i.e., A∈A_{B}∀A∈A and therefore A=A_{B}. (b) Suppose A⊂L(H) is a MASA. Any A∈A can be written as a sum of an Hermitian and an anti-Hermitian commuting parts. Moreover since all A’s commute, there exists an ORI {Qj}{j} such that A = ∑_{j}α_{j}Q_{j} (joint diagonal form for all elements of A). Now, all the Q_{j}’s have to be one-dimensional, i.e., {Qj}{j} has to be a MORI. In fact, if it were not so, it would exist at least one j_{0} such that Q_{j0} is higher-dimensional, and therefore, there it would exist a S∈L(H) which is non-diagonal but still commutes with all Q_{j}’s (and therefore with all elements in A). For example, one may consider a unitary map S which acts like the identity everywhere but on the range of Q_{j0} where it is a non-trivial unitary. The algebra generated by A and S is still abelian and strictly contains A. This shows that unless all Q_{j} are rank one the algebra A is not a MASA. In conclusion, if A is a MASA, then it is generated by a MORI, i.e., the map B↦A_{B} is surjective.Finally, let us assume A_{B̃}=A_{B}. This implies, in particular, that Π̃{i}=∑j=1dp_{j}Π_{j}(∀i). The spectrum of the LHS of this identity is {0, 1}, while the one of the RHS is {p_{j}}j=1d. Therefore p_{j} ∈ {0, 1} because they form a probability distribution, ∀i; there exists j = j(i) ∈ {1, …, d} such that Π̃{i}=Π_{j(i)}. This shows that the elements of B̃ are just a permutation of those of B, i.e., B=B̃. This amounts to prove that B↦A_{B} is injective.(ii) Since M_{d} is, as a set, the same as the set of all MORIs, we will focus on the structure of the latter. Let us consider the set X_{d}={(Π_{i})i=1d} of all ordered d-tuples of projectors Π_{i}’s such that {Π_{i}}i=1d is a MORI. By defining the S_{d}-action on X_{d} by (σ,(Π_{i})i=1d)↦(Π_{σ(i)})i=1d, then clearly the set of MORIs is nothing but X_{d}/S_{d}. Now, if x≔{(Π_{i}=|ii|)i=1d},x̃={(Π̃{i}=|ĩĩ|)i=1d}∈X_{d}, then U=∑i=1d|ĩi|=(U†){−1} maps one into the other by x↦U⋅x≔(UΠ_{i}U^{†})i=1d=x̃. This means that U(d) acts transitively over X_{d} as well as on M_{d} (forgetting the order). On the other hand, the stabilizer of x is given by {∑i=1dχ_{i}Π_{i}/χ_{i}∈U(1),i=1,…,d}≅U(1){d}. Then X_{d} ≅ U(d)/U(1)^{d} follows from the standard identification of the U(d)-homogeneous space X_{d} with the coset space obtained by dividing the group U(d) by the stabilizer subgroup. This concludes the proof.The space X_{d} in Eq. (2) can be seen as the compact, simply connected manifold of orthogonal full-flags [21]. This implies that M_{d} is topologically non-trivial as its fundamental group is isomorphic to S_{d}. Indeed π_{1}(M_{d})=π_{1}(X_{d}S_{d})≅S_{d}.Having introduced the basic algebraic and geometrical objects of our formalism, we now turn to physical concepts [15].
Definition 2. Given the MORI B={Π_{i}}i=1d, we define
(a) the B-incoherent states as the set of quantum states in A_{B}, i.e., I_{B}≔{∑j=1dp_{j}Π_{j}/p_{j}≥0,∑j=1dp_{j}=1}⊂A_{B}∈M_{d}.
(b) Given the quantum state ρ, we define its B-coherence by
(c) A unital CP-map T:H_{HS}→H_{HS} is called incoherent iff [T,D_{B}]=0.A couple of comments are here in order. (1) The definition above relies on the Hilbert-Schmidt norm ||•||_{2}; this, on the one hand, leads to a somewhat simplified theory of quantum coherence as it naturally restricts the set of allowed operations to unital ones (for which the Hilbert-Schmidt norm is not increasing). On the other hand, the simpler properties of ||•||_{2} allows one to obtain a wealth of rigorous analytical that can be hardly obtained by more information-theoretic motivated choices, e.g., the trace norm ||•||_{1}. (2) We also note that our definition of incoherent operations above falls in the class of dephasing-covariant incoherent operation as per the categorification of Ref [13] (see Table II therein).The set I_{B} is clearly a (d − 1)-dimensional simplex. The first equality in Eq. (3) stems from the fact that A_{B} is a (closed) linear subspace of H_{HS} and that D_{B} is the corresponding orthogonal projection on it. This equality also shows that c_{B}(ρ)=inf_{σ∈IB}‖ρ−σ‖22. The second equality simply defines the complementary projection Q_{B}≔1−D_{B}. Notice that, from (c) above, an incoherent map T is such that T(A_{B})⊂A_{B}. The latter condition, which can be written as D_{B}TD_{B}=TD_{B}, is a weaker notion of incoherence coinciding with (c) for normal maps T [15].Next we show that Eq. (3) defines a good coherence measure for unital maps and that it can also be seen as a quantitative measure of the lack of commutativity between the state ρ and A_{B}∈M_{d}.
Proposition 2. (i) The map ρ ↦ c_{B}(ρ) over quantum states ρ defined by Eq. (3) defines a good coherence measure, i.e., c_{B}(ρ)=0 iff ρ∈I_{B} and c_{B}(T(ρ))≤c_{B}(ρ) for T incoherent.
(ii) Let B={Π_{i}}i=1d be a MORI and ρ be a quantum state, and then one has c_{B}(ρ)=12∑j=1d‖[Π_{j},ρ]‖22.
Proof. This was proved in Ref [15]; we report the proof here for completeness. First, from (3) and the definition of I_{B}, one has c_{B}(ρ)=0⇔Q_{B}(ρ)=0⇔ρ=D_{B}(ρ)⇔ρ∈I_{B}. Second, c_{B}(T(ρ))=‖Q_{B}T(ρ)‖22=‖TQ_{B}(ρ)‖22≤‖Q_{B}(ρ)‖22=c_{B}(ρ). Here we have used that for incoherent maps [T,Q_{B}]=0 and that the Hilbert-Schmidt is monotonic under unital maps T, i.e., ‖T(X)‖{2}≤‖X‖{2},(∀X∈H_{HS}).
(ii) A simple computation shows
Summing over i, one obtains ∑i=1d‖Π_{j},ρ‖22=2‖ρ‖22−‖D_{B}ρ‖22=2‖Q_{B}ρ‖22=2c_{B}ρ. Here we have used the definition of D_{B} in Eq. (1) and the fact that D_{B}ρ,ρ=D_{B}ρ,D_{B}ρ=‖D_{B}ρ‖22.This result shows that the geometric notion of distance, the algebraic one of non-commutativity and the physical one of quantum coherence, are tightly tied together at the level of a single quantum state ρ. In the following, we will demonstrate that this connection holds at the level of the coherence generating power of unitary maps and pairs of MASAs.
III. COHERENCE POWER AND GRASSMANNIAN GEOMETRY
Once B-coherence is defined, one can ask the question about the ability of a unital CP-map to generate it. Here we will follow the probabilistic approach advocated in Ref [15]. The idea is that the coherence generating power (CGP) of a map T is the average coherence—as quantified by (4)—generated by T acting on a uniform ensemble of incoherent states. More precisely, let us now consider the uniform probability measure over I_{B} [15] and denote by E_{unif:IB}• the corresponding expectation.
Definition 3. Given the unital CP-map T:H_{HS}→H_{HS}, we define its B-coherence generating power (CGP) by
This approach to CGP is based on probabilistic averages as opposed to optimizations over a set of states and/or protocols, see, e.g., Ref [14]. Clearly, this choice makes harder to envisage a direct operational and information-theoretic meaning of (4). However, this strategy, along with the nice algebraic properties of the Hilbert-Schmidt norm, allows one to find explicit analytical results for arbitrary (unital) maps and dimensions. In fact, in Ref [15], we have proven the following fact:
Proposition 3. Let B={Π_{i}≔|ii|}i=1d be a MORI and T be a unital CP over H_{HS} and then C_{B}(T)=N_{d}∑j=1d‖Q_{B}T(Π_{j})‖22,Nd−1≔d(d+1). In particular, for unitary CP-maps U(X)≔UXU^{†}U∈Ud, one has
Proof. See Proposition 4 in Ref [15].It is now important to observe that M_{d} is a subset of the Grassmannian of d-dimensional linear subspaces W’s,
This is a differentiable manifold with (real) dimension d^{2}(d^{2} − 2). Now we would like to show that the CGP (5) has an underlying origin at the level of the geometry of M_{d}. The first step is to observe that, since MASAs belong to the Grassmannian, the set M_{d} inherits the metric structure of the latter.
Definition 4. Let A_{B},A_{B̃}∈M_{d}; we define a metric structure over M_{d} by
where ||•||_{HS} denotes the Hilbert-Schmidt norm over L(H_{HS}).It is a well-known fact that the distance between subspaces in a Grassmannian can be taken to be the (Hilbert-Schmidt) distance between the corresponding orthogonal projections; Eq. (7) is just the particular case for elements of M_{d}⊂G_{d}(H_{HS}). Notice that the distance (7) is invariant under the U(d) action over M_{d}, i.e., D(U(A_{B}),U(A_{B̃}))=D(A_{B},A_{B̃}) [20].One can now establish a direct connection between the distance (7) between MASAs and the, apparently totally unrelated, CGP of unitaries (5). The following proposition contains some of the key conceptual as well as technical results of this paper.
Proposition 4. (i) Let U be a unitary CP-map; then
(ii) D^{2}(A_{B},A_{B̃})=∑i,j=1d‖[Π_{i},Π̃{j}]‖22.
Proof. (i) We first show how to compute traces over L(H_{HS}) for maps of the form F:X↦AXB, where A,B∈L(H). By definition Tr(F)=∑s=1d^{2}X_{s},F(X_{s}), where {X_{s}}s=1d^{2} is an orthonormal basis in H_{HS}. If {|i}i=1d is an orthonormal basis of H, let us pick X_{s}=|lm|,s=(l,m),(l,m=1,…,d). Whence, Tr(F)=∑l,m=1dtr(|ml|A|lm|B)=(∑l=1dl|A|l)(∑m=1dm|B|m)=tr(A)tr(B). Let A_{B},A_{B̃}∈M_{d} associated with the MORIs B={Π_{i}=|ii|}i=1d and B̃={Π̃{i}=|ĩĩ|}i=1d, respectively. Now D^{2}(A_{B},A_{B̃})=‖D_{B}−D_{B̃}‖HS2=‖D_{B}‖HS2+‖D_{B̃}‖HS2−2Tr(D_{B}D_{B̃}). The first term can be written as Tr(DB2)=Tr(∑i,j=1dΠ_{i}Π_{j}•Π_{j}Π_{j})=∑i,j=1dTr(ΠiΠj){2}=∑i,j=1dδ_{ij}Tr(Πj){2}=d. The same is true for the second term. Let us now turn to the last term, Tr(D_{B}D_{B̃})=∑i,j=1dTr(Π_{i}Π̃{j}•Π̃{j}Π_{i})=∑i,j=1dtr(ΠiΠ̃j){2}=∑i,j=1dtr(|ii|j̃j̃|){2}=∑i,j=1d|⟨i|j̃⟩|^{4}. Adding the three terms, one gets
Now set |j̃≔U|j in the last equation and compare with Eq. (5).(ii) It is a direct computation. ∑i,j=1d‖Π_{i},Π̃{j}‖22=∑i,j=1d‖Π_{i}Π̃{j}−Π̃{j}Π_{i}‖22=∑i,j=1dtr(Π_{i}Π̃{j}Π_{i}+Π̃{j}Π_{i}Π̃{j}−Π_{i}Π̃{j}Π_{i}Π̃{j}−Π̃{j}Π_{i}Π̃{j}Π_{i})=2∑i,j=1dtr(Π_{i}Π̃{j})−tr(Π_{i}Π̃{j}Π_{i}Π̃{j})=2(d−∑i,j=1d|⟨i|j̃⟩|^{4}). Comparing with Eq. (9) concludes the proof.An alternative proof can be obtained by setting in Proposition 2 ρ=∑k=1dp_{k}U(Π_{k}), expanding the commutators norms and using E_{unif:IB}[p_{i}p_{k}]=N_{d}(1+δ_{ik}) [15].Equation (8) allows one to immediately and elegantly derive several properties of the CGP of unitaries (5). First, the only unitaries with zero CGP are those which fix A_{B}, i.e., the incoherent ones [see Definition 2 (c)]. Second, if W is B-incoherent because of the unitary invariance of the distance (7), one has that D(A_{B},WU(A_{B}))=D(W(A_{B}),WU(A_{B}))=D(A_{B},U(A_{B})). Now Eq. (8) implies C_{B}(U)=C_{B}(WU). Namely, the CGP of a map is invariant under postprocessing by incoherent unitaries [15]. Invariance under pre-processing by incoherent maps is trivial from (8). Third, from D(A_{B},U(A_{B}))=D(U^{†}(A_{B}),U^{†}U(A_{B}))=D(U^{†}(A_{B}),A_{B})=D(A_{B},U^{†}(A_{B})) and (8), one gets C_{B}(U) = C_{B}(U^{†}). The CGP of a unitary is equal to the one of its inverse.At the conceptual level, these results demonstrate that the physical concept of CGP, metric structure of the Grassmannian G_{d}(H_{HS}) (more precisely of M_{d}), and quantum non-commutativity are profoundly connected to each other. In words, the B-coherence generating power of a unitary map U is proportional to the Grassmannian distance between the input B-diagonal algebra A_{B} and its image under U. This distance, in turn, can be quantitatively identified with the lack of commutativity between these two algebras [24]. It is important to stress that, in the light of the results of Ref [15] the latter geometrical and algebraic properties can be directly measured by a quantum experiment, i.e., Grassmannian metric and non-commutativity are endowed with a physical as well as operational meaning.In passing, we mention that relation (8) suggests a straightforward path to extend the notion of CGP to infinite dimensions. Indeed one can replace the Hilbert-Schmidt norm in Eq. (7) by any unitary invariant norm for CP-maps and then define the CGP of a unitary map as the corresponding distance between A_{B} and U(A_{B}). However, for d = ∞, the characterization of the set of MASAs is a much more challenging task, and it lies beyond the scope of this paper.Another appealing feature of the framework here discussed is that it also allows one to introduce novel measures for CGP of unitaries with an underlying geometrical meaning. To this aim, it is useful to introduce one more definition.
Definition 5. Given a pair of ordered MORIs B_{<}=:(Π_{i}=|ii|)i=1d,B_{<}=:(Π̃{i}=|ĩĩ|)i=1d∈X_{d}, we define the associated d × d non-negative overlap matrix by Ô_{i,j}(B_{<},B̃{<})≔⟨Π_{i},Π̃{j}⟩=|⟨i|j̃⟩|^{2}≥0,(i,j=1,…,d). In particular, if B_{<} and B̃{<} are connected by the unitary U, i.e., B̃{<}=BU_{<}≔(U(Π_{i}))i=1d, we define X^{B<}(U)≔Ô(B_{<},BU_{<}) [X^{B<}(U){i,j}=|⟨i|U|j⟩|^{2},(i,j=1,…,d)].We first notice that Ô is doubly stochastic for any pair (B_{<},B̃{<}). Indeed, summing over j, one finds ∑j=1dÔ_{i,j}(B_{<},B̃{<})=∑j=1d⟨Π_{i},Π̃{j}⟩=⟨Π_{i},1⟩=trΠ_{i}=1,(∀i). The same result is obtained by summing over i. Let us remind the reader that, from the proof of (ii) of Proposition 1, the set X_{d} of unordered MORIs is acted upon by S_{d} via (Π_{i})i=1d×σ↦(Π_{σ(i)})i=1d and that a MORI in M_{d} is just an S_{d}-equivalence class [(Π_{i})i=1d] [see Eq. (2)]. The next proposition shows the other properties of the overlap matrix and how it can be used to define novel metric structures over M_{d} as well as CGP measures for unitaries.
Proposition 5. (i) The real-valued functions over X_{d} × X_{d} defined by ‖Ô(B<,B̃<)‖{2} and |detÔ(B_{<},B̃{<})| depend only on the S_{d}-equivalence classes B = [B_{<}] and B̃=[B̃{<}], i.e., they are functions over M_{d}×M_{d}. Moreover
(ii) The function D_{FS}:M_{d}×M_{d}→R^{+} is given by
where B_{<} and B̃{<} are any ordered MORIs in the S_{d}-equivalence classes B = [B_{<}] and B̃=[B̃{<}], respectively, which defines a unitary invariant metric over M_{d}.(iii) The following functions define good CGP measures:
where B_{<} is any ordered MORI in the S_{d}-equivalence class B = [B_{<}].
Proof. (i) It can easily be checked that if one reorders the elements in B_{<} and B̃{<}, the overlap matrix transforms according to Ô ↦ QÔP^{T}, where P and Q are unitary permutation matrices. From which, one immediately obtains the first part of (i). The first equality in Eq. (10) reads ∑i,j=1d|⟨i|j̃⟩|^{4}=Tr(D_{B}D_{B̃}) which has been already proven in the proof of Proposition 4 [see lines above Eq. (9)]. The range indicated follows from the fact that this norm is the sum of the purities of d probability vectors in d-dimensions (see below). Let us now turn to the second equality in Eq. (10). Let Ô = WO_{D}V^{†} be a Singular Value Decomposition of Ô with W and V unitaries and O_{D} = diag (λ_{1}, …, λ_{d}) be the diagonal matrix of the singular values of Ô. One has that |det(Ô)|=det(O_{D})=∏i=1dλ_{i}. The squares of λ_{i}’s on the other hand are the eigenvalues of the doubly stochastic matrix Ô^{T}Ô, whence 0 ≤ λ_{i} ≤ 1, (∀i). It follows that |det(Ô)| = 1 iff λ_{i} = 1 (∀i). This in turn is equivalent to ‖Ô‖22=tr(Ô^{T}Ô)=∑i,j=1dÔij2=∑i=1dλi2=d. Since Ô_{i}≔(Ô_{ij})j=1d (from double-stochasticity) are probability vectors ∀i, the former equality is possible iff ∑j=1dÔij2=1(∀i), i.e., all Ô_{i}’s are pure. This means that ∀i∃j = σ(i) such that Ô_{i,j} = δ_{j,σ(i)}. Moreover since ∑j=1dÔ_{j,σ(i)}=1, one sees that σ must be in S_{d}. In summary, |det(Ô)| = 1 iff ∃σ∈S_{d} such that Ô_{ij} = δ_{j,σ(i)}; this amounts to say that Π_{i}=Π̃{σ(i)}, for some permutation σ and ∀i, i.e., B=B̃.(ii) In order to show that (11) defines a distance function over M_{d}, we resort to the well-known Plücker embedding [22]. For MASAs A_{B} with B={Π_{i}=|ii|}i=1d, this embedding takes the form [25]
where ∧i=1dΠ_{i}≔1d!∑_{σ∈Sd}(−1){|σ|}⊗k=1dΠ_{σ(k)}, and [•] denotes the projective equivalence class. The standard Fubini-Study metric of the projective space d_{FS}([v], [w]) ≔ cos^{−1}(|⟨v|w⟩|) is given by d_{FS}(ψ(A_{B}),ψ(A_{B̃})). Using (14) and the standard properties of anti-symmetrized tensor products, one finds
where B_{<} and B̃{<} are any ordered MORIs in the S_{d}-equivalence class of B={Π_{i}}i=1d and B̃={Π̃{i}}i=1d, respectively. From this, it is evident that (11) is nothing but the pull-back of the Fubini-Study metric via the Plücker embedding (14).Unitary invariance of the metric (11) stems from the fact that the overlap matrix associated with U(A_{B}) and U(A_{B̃}) is given by Ô(BU<,B̃U<){i,j}=⟨U(Π_{i}),U(Π̃{j})⟩=⟨Π_{i},Π̃{j}⟩=Ô(B<,B̃<){i,j},(∀i,j), where we have used unitary invariance of the Hilbert-Schmidt scalar product.(iii) Finally, C̃{B}(U)≔D_{FS}(A_{B},U(A_{B}))=0 iff A_{B}=U(A_{B}) iff U is incoherent. Moreover, if W is incoherent C̃{B}(WU)≔D_{FS}(A_{B},WU(A_{B}))=D_{FS}(W(A_{B}),WU(A_{B}))=D_{FS}(A_{B},U(A_{B}))=C̃{B}(U), where we have used unitary invariance of D_{FS}. This shows that C̃{B} is a good CGP measure for unitaries [15].Turning to φ_{B} in (12), we see that φ_{B}(U) = 0 iff |detX^{B<}(U)|=1 and that from (i) above is equivalent to |detÔ(B_{<}, BU_{<})| = 1 ⇔ B = BU, namely, U is incoherent. Since for incoherent W’s one has X^{B<}(WU)=Q_{W}X^{B<} (where Q_{W} is a permutation matrix depending on W), one finds |detX^{B<}(WU)|=|detX^{B<}(U)| which shows invariance under post-processing by incoherent W’s.In view of Eq. (9) and Definition 5, one can write D^{2}(A_{B},A_{B̃})=2(d−‖Ô(B_{<},B̃{<})‖22), where B_{<} and B̃{<} are any ordered MORIs in the S_{d}-equivalence class of B={Π_{i}}i=1d and B̃={Π̃{i}}i=1d. Eq. (10) now shows that the maximum distance between MASAs is given by 2(d−1), and it is achieved when the overlap matrix is given by the Van der Waerden’s matrix, i.e., ⟨Π_{i},Π̃{j}⟩=1/d,(∀i,j). In this case, the MORIs B and B̃ correspond to mutually unbiased bases [27], and the unitary connecting them, because of (8), has maximum CGP.It is also worthwhile stressing that Eq. (15) shows that the modulus of the determinant of the overlap matrix Ô(B_{<},BU_{<})=X^{B<}(U) has a natural interpretation as fidelity between the input and output MASAs A_{B} and U(A_{B}).The second measure in Eq. (12) was introduced in Ref [16] [(ii) in Proposition 9]; here we see that it is rooted in the geometry of the Grassmannian seen as sub-variety of the projective space P∧i=dH_{HS}. If H=H_{1}⊗H_{2} and B_{α}=Πiαi=1d_{α}≔dimH_{α},α=1,2 is a MORI over H_{α},α=1,2, one can define a product MORI by B=Πi1⊗Πj2/i=1,…,d_{1};j=1,…,d_{2}. From (13) (see also Ref [16]), one finds φ_{B}U_{1}⊗U_{2}=φ_{B1}(U_{1})+φ_{B2}(U_{2}), where U_{i}∈UH_{i},(i=1,2), i.e., the measure φ_{B} is additive [28].
IV. DIFFERENTIAL GEOMETRY OF COHERENCE POWER
We now move to consider a differentiable metric structure. This is done in terms of the natural Rienmannian metric over the Grassmannian ds^{2} = D(P, P + dP)^{2} = Tr(dP^{2}). In view of the result (8), this metric will have the physical interpretation as the CGP of the unitary associated with an infinitesimal change of the MORI. For example, if B is the MORI associated to (a non-degenerate) Hamiltonian H, a perturbation H ↦ H + δV = H′ will induce a change to an infinitesimally close one B′. In view of Eq. (8), the distance between the corresponding MASAs would then measure the CGP of the (infinitesimal) adiabatic intertwiner δW_{ad} between the eigenstate systems of H and H′, i.e., C_{B}(δW_{ad})=N_{d}2ds^{2}.
Proposition 6. If B={Π_{i}=|ii|}i=1d, then
Moreover dsFS2=1/2ds^{2}.
Proof. Let us write differentials as dX = Ẋdt; then (ds/dt){2}=TrDḂ{2}. One has D_{B}̇=∑i=1d(Π_{i}̇•Π_{i}+Π_{i}•Π_{i}̇), whence DḂ{2}=∑i,j=1dΠ_{j}̇Π_{i}̇•Π_{i}+Π_{i}•Π_{i}̇Π_{j}+Π_{j}Π_{i}̇•Π_{i}+Π_{i}•Π_{i}̇Π_{j}̇. Now, 1/2TrDḂ{2}=∑i=1dtrΠi̇{2}+∑i,j=1dtrΠ_{j}Π_{i}̇trΠ_{i}Π_{j}̇. From orthornormality follows trΠ_{j}Π_{i}̇=trΠ_{j}Π_{i}̇Π_{i}=0∀i,j; therefore TrDḂ{2}=2∑i=1dtrΠi̇{2}. By writing Π_{i}=|ii| and differentiating, a standard calculation [26] shows that 1/2‖Π_{i}̇‖22=didt|didt−|didt|i|^{2}=χ_{i}/dt^{2}; therefore ds/dt{2}=4∑i=1ddidt|didt−|didt|i|^{2}. Reabsorbing the dt factors on the RHS, one finds (16).To see that dsFS2 has the same expression as ds^{2}, we use the fact det(1+δX^{B})=1+trδX^+⋯. Expanding Π̃{j} near |Π_{j} in (X^B){ij}=Π,Π̃{j}, one finds (δX^B){ij}=Π,dΠ_{j}+12Π,d^{2}Π_{j}. Taking the trace, one has ∑i=1d(δX^B){ii}=12Π,d^{2}Π_{i}=−12∑i=1ddΠ,dΠ_{i}. Here we have used that Π_{i}dΠ_{i}Π_{i} = 0 and ∑i=1dΠ,d^{2}Π_{i}=−∑i=1d‖dΠ_{i}‖22 (obtained by differentiating and adding the identities Πi2=Π_{i}). As in the above, ‖dΠ_{i}‖22=2χ_{i}. Now one has that dsFS2=cos^{−1}(1−∑i=1dχ_{i}), and the claim is obtained by expanding the cos.χ_{i}’s in Eq. (16) are projective space metrics associated to |i’s. When the latter are Hamiltonian eigenstates, χ_{i}’s are known as fidelity susceptibilities. The metric (16) is a sum of projective space ones. This reflects the fact that locally [see the numerator of Eq. (2)] the set of MASAs is the full-flag manifold U(d)/U(1)^{d} which is the set of ordered tuples (Π_{i})i=1d. The latter can be seen as a subvariety of G_{1}(H){d}=P(H){d} by the obvious embedding.Physically, the ground state susceptibility χ_{0} plays a key role in the differential geometric approach to quantum phase transitions (QPT) started in Ref [26]. The idea is that when χ_{0}, which depends of the parameters defining the Hamiltonian, shows some singularity in the thermodynamical limit or a super extensive (for local Hamiltonians) behavior for finite-size systems a QPT is occurring at that point in the parameter space [26].From this perspective, Eqs. (8) and (16) are intriguing as they comprise information about all eigenstates. It is therefore tempting to wonder whether these geometric quantities, which are quantifying quantum coherence power at the same time, can be exploited to study phase transitions in which a radical change is occurring at the level of whole Hamiltonian eigenstate system, e.g., many-body localization [29].
V. ONE QUBIT
In order to illustrate the general results proved in this paper, we consider explicitly the qubit case, i.e., d = 2. In this case,
where we used Eq. (2) and S_{2}≅Z_{2}. This has a simple geometrical interpretation since MORIs (and therefore MASAs) in two-dimensions have the form B={Πα}{α=±}, where Π_{α}≔12(1+αn⋅σ),(α=±); σ_{α}’s are the standard Pauli matrices and n=(n_{x},n_{y},n_{z})∈S^{2}. Thus it is clear that n is identified with −n as they both correspond to the same MORI. This simple example also shows that the set of MASAs may have non-trivial topology: loops in M_{2} fall in two topologically distinct categories, the trivial (non-trivial) which corresponds to (Π_{1}, Π_{2}) ↦ (Π_{1}, Π_{2}) ((Π_{1}, Π_{2}) ↦ (Π_{2}, Π_{1})), i.e., π_{1}(M_{2})≅Z_{2}.
If B̃={12(1+βñ⋅σ)}{β=±}, one can easily check that the overlap matrix is given by Ô_{αβ}(B,B̃)=12(1+αβn⋅ñ),(α,β=±), whose spectrum is {1, n ⋅ ñ} and therefore detÔ(B,B̃)=n⋅ñ and ‖Ô(B,B̃)‖22=1+(n⋅ñ){2}. Whence
where ψ ≔ cos^{−1}(n⋅ñ). From Eq. (18), we clearly see that the MASAs corresponding to n and −n are identified thus confirming that globally M_{2}≅S^{2}/Z_{2} as given by Eq. (17) [23]. On the other hand, n ⊥ ñ correspond to maximally far apart MASAs.
Now we consider the commutators [Π_{α},Π̃{β}]=iαβ2(n×ñ)⋅σ. From which, ∑_{α,β=±}‖[Π_{α},Π̃{β}]‖22=2‖n×ñ‖{2}=2sin^{2}ψ. Comparing this last equation with (18) confirms (ii) of Proposition 4. If n = (0, 0, 1) and B̃=BU with U=a|00|+a^{*}|11|−b^{*}|01|+b|10|,(a=cos(θ/2),b=e^{iφ}sin(θ/2)), then ñ = (sinθcosφ, sinθsinφ, cosθ) ⇒ ψ = cos^{−1}(n⋅ñ) = θ. From Proposition 4 and (18), one gets [15]
Maximum CGP is attained by all U’s with θ = π/2 irrespective of φ as the corresponding ñ’s are equidistant from n = (0, 0, 1).
Furthermore, from detÔ(B,B̃)=n⋅ñ=cosψ, it follows immediately from Eq. (11) that D_{FS}(A_{B},A_{B̃})=cos^{−1}|cosψ| which is given by ψ for ψ ∈ [0, π/2] and by π − ψ for ψ ∈ [π/2, π].
Finally, from ds^{2}=2∑_{α=±}‖dΠ_{α}‖22=2∑_{α=±}‖α2dn⋅σ‖22=2‖dn‖{2}, one sees that the CGP metric is proportional to the standard Euclidean metric of S^{2}.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we have unveiled a deep connection between the notion of quantum coherence generating power of unitary operations (introduced in Refs [15] and  [16] on purely physical grounds) and the geometry of the Grassmannian of subspaces of the algebra of linear operators. Given a maximal orthogonal resolution of the identity B in the Hilbert space H≅C^{d} of a quantum system, one can consider the d-dimensional algebra A_{B} generated by B. This is a maximal abelian subalgebra (MASA) of the full operator algebra L(H) which is closed under Hermitian conjugation. The set of all MASAs is a topologically non-trivial subset of the Grassmannian of d-dimensional subspaces of the Hilbert-Schmidt space L(H)≅C^{d2}. Given a unitary map U, we have shown that its coherence generating power with respect to B is proportional to the Grassmannian distance, as well as the lack of commutativity, between the MASAs A_{B} and U(A_{B}). By embedding the set of MASAs into the projectivation of the d-th exterior power of the Hilbert-Schmidt space, one can pull-back the standard Fubini-Study metric and obtain novel coherence power measures endowed by a natural geometrical interpretation.
