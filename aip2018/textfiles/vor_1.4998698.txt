On the formation modes in vortex interaction for multiple co-axial co-rotating vortex rings
Interaction among multiple vortices is of particular importance to biological locomotion. It plays an essential role in the force and energy capture. This study examines the motion and dynamics of multiple co-axial co-rotating vortex rings. The vortex rings, which have the same formation time, are successively generated in a piston-cylinder apparatus by accurately controlling the interval time. The flow fields are visualized by the finite-time Lyapunov exponent and then repelling Lagrangian coherent structures (r-LCSs) are determined. Two types of vortex interactions (“strong” and “weak”) are defined by investigating the r-LCSs: a strong interaction is indicated by connected r-LCSs showing a channel for fluid transport (termed as a “flux window”); a weak interaction is indicated by disconnected r-LCSs between the vortex rings. For strong interaction, leapfrogging and merger of vortex rings can happen in the later stage of the evolution process; however, the rings are separated for weak interaction. Two distinct formation modes, the formation enhancement mode (FEM) and formation restraint mode (FRM), refer to the effect of one or multiple vortex ring(s) on the initial circulation of the subsequently formed vortex ring. In the FEM, the circulation of a vortex ring is larger than that of an isolated (without interaction) vortex ring. On the other hand, the situation is opposite in the FRM. A dimensionless number reflecting the interaction mechanism, “structure stretching number” S^{*}, is proposed, which evaluates the induced effect of the wake vortices on the formation of a vortex ring. A limiting S^{*} (SL*=(2±0.4)×10^{−4}) is the bifurcation point of the two formation modes. The augmentation of circulation reaches up to 10% for the FEM when S^{*}<SL*, while in the FRM (S^{*}>SL*), the circulation decreases for at most 20%. The newly defined formation modes and number could shed light on the understanding of the dynamics of multiple vortex ring flows.
I. INTRODUCTION
Interaction among vortices is one of the sources of force augmentation from the wake or surrounding flow in biological unsteady flying and swimming. In the wake of propulsion of jellyfish [1], swimming of fishes [2,3], hovering of insects [4], and some group locomotion of animals [3,5], multiple co-rotating vortices are shed and interact with each other. These vortex interactions can be simplified into the interaction of jet vortex rings for experimental study in laboratory. Previous studies have studied the interaction of dual vortex rings [6,7]. Vortex enhancement was found if the formation time and interval between strokes were suitable. The interaction among multiple co-axial co-rotating vortex rings is in fact more general and a canonical problem, which should be further studied.
Previous studies have made great efforts to observe leapfrogging phenomena of a pair of co-axial co-rotating vortex rings for several decades. Interest was aroused by a theoretical description [8], and experiments have been conducted to observe leapfrogging. Successful leapfrogging of dual vortex rings was continuously observed [9–12] after several failures [13,14]. However, no work has been reported so far on the interacting phenomena of multiple vortex rings experimentally, which researchers have made efforts to numerically realize [15–17]. Cheng et_al [17] have presented some fascinating interacting phenomena of three and four vortex rings in viscous flow fields. The above-mentioned studies mainly focus on the success of realizing leapfrogging phenomena instead of the benefits that the vortex interaction can bring.
In order to realize success leapfrogging, parameters have also been comprehensively discussed. A larger Reynolds number was first proposed to realize leapfrogging [9,13,14]. The initial spacing between two vortex rings is considered a key parameter for successful leapfrogging [10–12,17]. When considering thin- or thick-cored vortex rings, a ratio of core to toroidal radius is taken into account [12]. In these phenomenological and parametric studies, the formation of vortex rings is not considered in their studies of vortex interaction, especially in the numerical simulation. It also remains doubtful whether these empirical parameters are suitable for studying the interaction mechanisms.
In order to study the interaction mechanisms, efforts have been made on investigating some reasonable mechanisms from nature and laboratorial observations. The widely known Strouhal number St ranges from 0.2 to 0.4, within which propulsive efficiency is high [18,19]. Inspired from the Strouhal number, Krueger and Gharib [7] defined the pulsing duty cycle Sr_{L}, a kind of jet frequency, together with the formation time to explain thrust augmentation in dual vortex ring flows. It is found that thrust augmentation is as high as 90% for the vortex rings at lower Sr_{L} with smaller formation time. Fu et_al [6] also stated that two distinct time scales (one is formation time scale and the other is due to vortex interaction) together determine the mechanisms of transient force augmentation in dual vortex ring flows. These mechanisms for the interaction were proposed statistically and empirically, or their definitions are not clear enough to be practically applied. The interaction mechanism should be concluded and proposed more strictly from fundamental vortex dynamics and through mathematical derivation.
In the past, the flow visualization of dual and multiple vortex ring flows is mainly divided into dyeing [11] and vorticity contour [12,17]. For this complex flow structure, the Eulerian method is not enough to further study the interaction problems. An alternative to present the motion of multiple vortex rings and analyze it is to study the flows from a Lagrangian perspective. Fluid particle trajectories are used as the fundamental variable. The proposal of a finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) [20–23] is a new and better way to study the motion of multiple co-axial co-rotating vortex rings. The FTLE ridges may sometimes produce false positives and negatives [23]. For more accurate detection of Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs), the concept of hyperbolic LCSs based on the FTLE has been proposed, which represents the material lines that locally exhibit the most repelling shrink or the most attracting stretch lines. Therefore, vortex rings can be efficiently separated and fluid transport can be analyzed in terms of hyperbolic LCSs based on the FTLE ridges [22,24,25].
Motivated by the contribution of vortex interaction to biological propulsion, this paper aims to study the effects of vortex interaction on vortex dynamics and proposes an interaction mechanism for multiple co-axial co-rotating vortex ring flows. The rest of the paper is arranged as follows. An experimental design, case descriptions, and a flow-visualization method are introduced in Sec. II. Section III presents interacting phenomena of multiple co-axial co-rotating vortex rings, and the transition of vortex interaction is found. The role of interaction in the vortex formation process based on the discussion of circulation of multiple vortex rings is studied in Sec. IV, and two formation modes are found. Section V explores a dimensionless number reflecting the vortex interaction as a unified interaction mechanism for multiple vortex rings. Finally, concluding remarks are presented in Sec. VI followed by some discussion.
II. METHODS
A. Experimental setup
The experiments were conducted in a glass water tank [4 m in length × 1 m in width × 1 m in height (0.7 m in water depth)]. The classic piston-cylinder apparatus was used to generate co-axial co-rotating vortex rings. The schematic layout of the relevant features of the apparatus is shown in Fig. 1. Two piston-cylinder arrangements are submerged in water. The vertically placed cylinder, called driver section, is attached to a linear screw actuator, and the horizontal cylinder, named jet section, is connected with the nozzle. These two cylinders are connected using a flexible hose fully filled with water. The linear screw actuator drives the piston in the driver section, which can drive the piston in the jet section through water to generate vortex rings. The piston velocity is controlled by a servo motor through a custom-designed program. The nozzle is 5 cm in inner diameter with a wedge-shaped edge of 17°.
A CCD camera is mounted in front of a laser sheet in order to measure the flow on the symmetry plane using the method of digital particle image velocity (DPIV). The flow is seeded with hollow, silver-coated, neutrally buoyant glass spheres with diameters within the range of 30-50 μm. The particles are illuminated with a 10 W Nd:YAG laser whose beam is formed into a 2-mm-thick sheet using a cylindrical lens. A CCD camera with a resolution of 2320 × 1200 pixels and a 50 Hz frame rate records the motion of particles. Particle movement is analyzed to determine the two-dimensional velocity vector of flows using a window shifting algorithm to cross correlate the images with a 64 × 64 pixel correlation window size and a moving average step size of 16 × 16 pixels. The flow velocity vector fields are generated on a 229 × 117 grid with a spatial resolution of 0.14 × 0.14 cm. By satisfying the constraints (interval time, particle size, and particle concentration) of the DPIV measurement and after alignment, the uncertainties in the velocity measurement and vorticity calculation were 1% and 3%, respectively [26,27].
B. Case descriptions
The motion of a piston in the jet section was accurately controlled by computer programs. As shown in Fig. 1, the formation time L/D means the motion of a piston pushing a column of fluid of length L through a nozzle of diameter D. The commanded nozzle exit velocity programs used to generate vortex rings are constant acceleration and deceleration, and the maximum velocity is at the half of each stroke. The purpose of this velocity profile is to reduce or even eliminate the formation of a stopping vortex around the exit of nozzle at the end of each stroke. Each stoke should have a peak nozzle exit velocity of 10 cm s^{−1}. The commanded stroke time of case L/D = n is just n s in our experiments, also as shown in Fig. 1. The actual maximum nozzle exit velocity is, however, smaller than the commanded velocity, which is listed in Table I. The errors result from the slight dilation of the flexible hose during strokes and the frictional force of the piston in the jet section. Although the maximum nozzle exit velocity is smaller than the commanded one, the measured stroke lengths L are 2.44% and 0.23% smaller than the commanded ones for L/D = 1 and L/D = 4, respectively.
Jet Reynolds number Re is calculated based on the maximum nozzle exit velocity u_{max}, nozzle diameter D, and fluid viscosity ν,
The corresponding jet Reynolds numbers for different L/D are listed in Table I, which range from 3250 to 4150. According to experiments conducted by Maxworthy [13], Oshima [14], and Yamada and Matsui [9], successful leapfrogging is produced in laboratory experiments when the Reynolds number is larger than 1600. Thus, leapfrogging should be observed in some certain cases in our experiments. The measured circulation is compared against the circulation calculated based on the slug model [28], listed in Table I. The circulation calculated from the slug model is close to the measured circulation except for L/D = 1. At small L/D, it is known that the circulation calculated from the slug model is much smaller than the actual one, which is proved by our results.
The benchmarks are the cases that only one vortex ring is generated, shown in the first two columns in Table II. It is also considered as an isolated vortex ring without interaction. The name “case n” corresponds to the case of L/D = n. For different purposes, our experiments were separated into two steps. In the first step (experiment 1 in Table II), several strokes without interval time were generated. The formation time L/D is from 1 to 4, and the stroke number is from 2 to 5. The second one (experiment 2 in Table II) is two strokes generated with different interval times. Because of the experimental limits, only cases of L/D = 1 and L/D = 2 are conducted and the interval time ranges from 0.25 s to 3.00 s. The naming method is illustrated as follows. In the case named as “case n-m-k,” the first number “n” is the formation time L/D = n, the second one “m” corresponds to the number of m strokes in a row, and the last one “k” is the interval time Δt = k s between two strokes. In experiment 2, the interval time Δt is defined as the time between the end of the previous stroke and the beginning of the later one, which is marked in Fig. 1.
C. Finite-time Lyapunov exponent field and hyperbolic Lagrangian coherent structures
A Lagrangian criterion is applied based on the distribution of the finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) field [21,22,29]. A flow map ϕtt+T:x(t)→x(t+T) is defined as the mapping of a material point located at x(t) at time t to its position x(t + T) at time t + T. The finite-time Cauchy–Green deformation tensor is defined as
The FTLE measures the maximum stretching about a material point over a chosen time interval and is defined as
where λ_{max}Δ(x,t,T) denotes the maximum eigenvalue of Δ(x, t, T). The absolute value T is used instead of T because the FTLE can be computed for T > 0 and T < 0. Forward-time integration (T > 0) reveals repelling ridges, and backward-time integration (T < 0) locates attracting ridges. The integration time T is chosen according to the particular flow being analyzed. The maximum integration time for each case in our experiments is 3.00 s, which is sufficient to get the clear ridges of FTLE fields. In some cases, however, it is required that integration time should be less than or equal to the piston movement time or the maximum frames of raw data. Integration time will be stated corresponding to every FTLE field. The area circled by forward- and backward-time FTLE ridges will be extracted in order to calculate the parameters. The mesh has been checked, including 1001 × 501, 2001 × 1001, and 4001 × 2001 grids for a spatial resolution of 0.330 × 0.168 m. Considering the cost of time, the 2001 × 1001 grid is chosen. The uncertainty in area calculation is within 0.5% compared with the 4001 × 2001 grid.
The ridges of the FTLE are heuristic indicators of hyperbolic Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs) though equating FTLE ridges with LCSs would create theoretical inconsistencies as well as false positives and negatives in hyperbolic LCS detection [23,30]. Hyperbolic LCSs can be either the repelling LCSs (r-LCSs) exhibiting locally the most repelling shrink lines or the attracting LCSs (a-LCSs) exhibiting locally the most attracting stretch lines.
The Cauchy-Green tensor is symmetric and positive definite. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Δ(x, t, T) are labeled as follows:
The eigenvalues (λ_{1}, λ_{2}, λ_{1} < λ_{2}) and eigenvectors (ξ_{1}, ξ_{2}) of the forward-time Cauchy-Green strain tensor of each points are computed. The numerical algorithm to extract hyperbolic LCSs was developed by Farazmand and Haller [31]. R-LCSs are the strain lines that are everywhere tangent to the field of unit eigenvectors associated with the smaller eigenvalue. Based on the criteria proposed by Haller [32], the initial coordinates are selected for computing r-LCSs. A group of r-LCSs is obtained, and several of them are close to each other and almost coincide. These similar r-LCSs are filtered out using the same method applied by Farazmand and Haller [31] and Miron and Vetel [33]. The integration time for computing r-LCSs is the same as that for computing forward-time FTLE at the same moment in the same case.
III. INTERACTING PHENOMENA OF MULTIPLE CO-AXIAL CO-ROTATING VORTEX RINGS
A. Leapfrogging and merger of multiple vortex rings
Previous studies have shown that when two co-axial co-rotating vortex rings travel in the same direction, it could lead to a process called leapfrogging of vortex rings [10–12]. In most of the experimental studies, only the flow fields involving two vortex rings are investigated. The cases involving more than two vortex rings, however, have received little attention. Cheng et_al [17] recently simulated the motion of more than two vortex rings in viscous flows. The results show that leapfrogging definitely exists in multiple vortex ring flows. It is also verified by our experiments that leapfrogging can be realized not only in the fields of dual vortex rings but also in multiple vortex ring flows, as shown in Fig. 2.
Figure 2 presents the formation and evolution of three successively generated vortex rings with L/D = 1 without interval time (case 1-3-0) in FTLE fields, illustrating the typical leapfrogging and merger of multiple vortex rings. The number marked in the figure is the order of generation. We use “Vn” to represent the nth generated vortex ring. In addition, “Vnm” is the merged vortex ring of the nth and mth vortex rings. In all the figures showing the FTLE contours, the red lines are the ridges of forward-time FTLE and the blue lines indicate the ridges of backward-time FTLE.
From Figs. 2(b)–2(f), a successful leapfrogging process of the rear vortex ring (V2) through the front one (V1) is achieved. Similar to the phenomena in the previous studies, the diameter of the front ring (V1) extends a little, whereas the rear ring (V2) evidently contracts [Fig. 2(c)]. V1 decelerates with increased radius, whereas V2 accelerates. V2 contracts to the situation that the diameter is just the same as the inner-path diameter of V1 and then goes through V1. After V2 successively goes through the center of V1 [Fig. 2(d)] and appears in the front, the radius of V2 extends rapidly [Figs. 2(e) and 2(f)], and the two vortex rings reverse their roles.
From Figs. 2(e)–2(i), V3 and V1 attempt to go through V2 but fail in the end. These three vortex rings finally merge into one large disturbed vortex ring. The phenomenon of merger is actually the failure of leapfrogging because the inner path of the front vortex ring is not large enough for the rear vortex rings to go through.
In our experiments, the leapfrogging also exists in dual vortex flows (case 1-2-0) and flows of more than three vortex rings (case 1-4-0 and case 1-5-0). For the detailed interacting phenomena, refer to the work of Qin et_al [34] With the increase of formation time and interval time, however, the leapfrogging cannot be observed, replaced by the phenomena of merger or separation of the vortex rings. Therefore, these typical examples of leapfrogging and merger show that those phenomena presented in dual vortex flows in the previous studies also exist in the fields of multiple vortex rings.
B. “Flux window” in multiple vortex ring flows
Forward-time FTLE ridges have been applied to identify the pinch-off of leading vortex rings from the trailing vortices [25], which is a kind of vortex separation. With the development of LCSs, r-LCSs in the scope of hyperbolic LCSs have been considered as a more precise method compared with forward-time FTLE ridges to identify vortex separation. R-LCSs represent the material lines that exhibit locally the most repelling shrink lines. If the r-LCSs of two vortex rings are connected, there exists a channel for fluid transport between them, indicating a strong interaction. The two vortex rings are separated when the r-LCSs of the leading one are closed. The disconnected r-LCSs indicate a weak interaction.
The r-LCSs are first presented in three successively generated vortex rings (case 1-3-0) shown by the dotted lines in Figs. 2(b) and 2(e). Lines of r-LCSs fit well with some ridges of forward-time FTLE, which proves the validity of FTLE. The r-LCSs between V1 and V2 in Fig. 2(b) and among V1, V2, and V3 in Fig. 2(e) are all connected. Between the upper and lower r-LCSs, a channel is opened for fluid transport, which is termed as a “flux window.” The flux window has also been found in the formation of the vortex ring generated by an impulsively started circular disc, shown by FTLE ridges [26]. The larger the flux window, the more the fluid transport can be achieved, and therefore the stronger the interaction between the vortex rings is.
In order to further discuss the flux window and the connection of r-LCSs between vortex rings, some typical cases of dual vortex rings during and after the formation of the second vortex rings are taken as examples in Fig. 3. For the cases of relatively small interval time between strokes (case 1-2-1.50 and case 2-2-0.25), the r-LCSs are connected between the vortex rings all through the formation process, and it will not break during the evolution process. A large flux window is opened for fluid transport between the two vortex rings. With the increase of interval time (case 1-2-3.00 and case 2-2-2.50), however, the r-LCSs of the leading vortex rings are closed during and after the formation of the second vortex rings. The front vortex ring is detached from the rear one from the beginning of the second stroke. Strong vortex interaction refers to the connected r-LCSs between vortex rings, while the disconnected r-LCSs indicate weak interaction.
C. Transition of vortex interaction
A transition exists from strong to weak interaction in a case, which can be observed from Figs. 3(i) and 3(j). During the formation of the second vortex ring in case 3-2-0, the r-LCSs are connected between the rings, whereas the flux window is relatively smaller than that in case 1-2-1.50 and case 2-2-0.25. However, a door-like r-LCS is forming at the end of the second stroke, which is closing the flux window. In a later evolution process, a closed r-LCS for the front ring is formed like case 2-2-2.50, and these two vortex rings separate from each other.
The connected and disconnected r-LCSs between vortex rings can directly reflect the strength of vortex interaction. The flux window between the vortex rings inside the connected r-LCSs is the channel for fluid transport. Strong interaction is indicated by the connected r-LCSs. The phenomena of leapfrogging and merger between vortex rings can happen in the later stage of the evolution process shown by Fig. 2. Weak interaction is presented by disconnected r-LCSs, leading to the separation of the front and rear vortex rings in later evolution. The transition from strong to weak interaction exists not only in a single case but also in a set of cases as interval time increases, which has the same formation time. R-LCS is a feasible and effective method to divide the multiple interacting vortex rings into several groups for further analyzing interaction mechanisms.
IV. ROLE OF VORTEX INTERACTION IN FORMATION PROCESS
A. Circulation of the entire multiple vortex ring flows
Figure 4 gives some examples of measured circulation of the whole flow fields. The black hollow squares in both plots are the benchmark cases for L/D = 1 (case 1) and L/D = 2 (case 2), respectively. The circulation of the flow fields experiences a slight decreasing trend due to the viscosity of fluid after the formation of the vortex rings. The trends for the cases of two successively generated vortex rings with or without interval time after the formation of the second stroke are similar to those of a single vortex ring. However, it is shown that for the case 1-2-0, the initial circulation (t ≈ 2.5–3.2 s) keeps constant, while a little damping appears during t ≈ 3.2–4.6 s, whose trend is different from that of a single vortex ring. After this damping, the trend restores the original one which is similar to that of a single vortex ring. The reason for the damping is the perturbation of the vortex rings due to the interaction between them in experiments. The perturbation is inevitable in experiments, and a more precise control of experiments can only reduce the probability of mistakes.
It can be noted from Fig. 4 that the interaction among multiple vortex rings during vortex evolution does not increase or decrease the circulation of the entire flow fields. The only period when the interaction affects the total circulation of the flow fields is the formation process. Therefore, the focus of this study is the effects of vortex interaction on the formation of vortex rings in Secs. IV B and IV C.
B. Circulation of multiple vortex rings in the formation process
1. Circulation of multiple vortex rings without interval time
In the first step of our experiments, the multiple vortex rings are generated without interval time. Figure 5 shows the circulation of the forming vortex rings in multiple vortex ring flows compared with that of a single isolated vortex ring. The growth trends of circulation of vortex rings with the same formation time are similar in all the cases. However, it is indicated that the time delay exists in the growth trends later generated vortex rings compared with those of benchmarks, and the time when the circulation reaches its maximum also delays.
In Figs. 5(a) and 5(b), cases of L/D = 1 and L/D = 2 are presented. The number of strokes is from 2 to 5. The same color represents a group of the same generation order. As presented, the circulation of vortex rings of the same generation order is similar to each other during the formation process, which indicates that the experiments are repeatable. The circulation of vortex rings in some cases (such as the fourth in L/D = 1 as well as the fourth and fifth in L/D = 2) is higher than that of a single vortex ring at the stroke end, whereas the rest is lower except that circulation of the third in L/D = 2 is almost the same as that of an isolated vortex ring. It is indicated that the interaction between vortex rings can augment or decrease the circulation of the forming vortex rings. However, it cannot be predicted that the circulation of which vortex ring is increased because the same interval time results in quite different situations in multiple successively generated vortex rings. Further work has to be done in order to seek the potential parameters.
Figures 5(c) and 5(d) also present the cases of L/D = 3 and L/D = 4. Only the cases of two successively generated vortex rings are shown because of the experimental limits. The circulation of the second vortex rings is a little smaller than that of the benchmarks at the stroke end. As shown in Figs. 3(i) and 3(j), the small flux window is opened during formation and closed at the end of the second stroke. Thus, weak reduction in circulation is reflected from Fig. 5(c).
2. Circulation of dual vortex rings with interval time
The results of multiple vortex rings with interval time (experiment 1) seem rambling and confusing. In order to further study the effects of interaction between vortex rings on the circulation, dual vortex rings with several different interval times are generated (experiment 2). The cases of L/D = 1 and L/D = 2 are conducted, as shown in Fig. 6. In all the cases of the dual vortex ring system, the larger interval time between strokes results in larger spacing between the two vortex rings because the previously formed vortex ring evolves with the passage of the interval time. Therefore, the interval time is used here to represent the interval spacing between vortex rings.
In experiment 2, relatively smaller interval times (Δt ≤ 0.50 s) result in the restraint of circulation at the stroke ends, whereas the cases of larger interval times (Δt > 0.50 s) bring the benefits of circulation augmentation. With increasing interval time, the circulation then tends to approach that of an isolated vortex ring. The circulation at the stroke end increases with increasing interval time in the cases of the interval time ranging from 0.00 s to 2.00 s. After that (Δt > 2.00 s), the augmentation appears small and the circulation is almost the same as that of an isolated vortex ring.
The growth trends of circulation are distinct from those of benchmarks. During the first half of the stroke, the growth of the second vortex rings lags behind that of the benchmarks. In the second half, the growth of cases of circulation restraint catches up with that of the benchmarks and that of circulation augmentation even exceeds the benchmarks.
C. Formation modes
Noticing from the differences in circulation in Figs. 5 and 6, two formation modes can be distinguished, which are the formation restraint mode (FRM) and formation enhancement mode (FEM). FRM and FEM refer to the effect of one or multiple vortex ring(s) on the initial circulation of the subsequently formed vortex ring. For L/D = 1, these two modes are more easily distinguished, while it becomes hard for the cases of L/D = 2 to detect the modes.
In the FRM, the circulation of the forming vortex rings at the stroke ends is smaller than that of an isolated vortex ring with the same formation time (referring to the red nodes in Fig. 6). These cases are in the situations of small interval time (Δt ≤ 0.5 s for L/D = 1 and Δt ≤ 1.0 s for L/D = 2 in experiment 2). The circulation of the forming vortex rings in the FEM at the stroke ends is larger than that of an isolated vortex ring with the same formation time (referring to the blue nodes in Fig. 6). In the dual vortex ring system, the interval time can distinguish the two formation modes, but the values are different for different formation times. The distinct formation modes are, however, weakly associated with the interval time indicated from the results in multiple vortex ring flows. A more reliable mechanism should be proposed for evaluating the interaction in multiple vortex ring flows.
V. A MECHANISM OF VORTEX INTERACTION IN MULTIPLE VORTEX RINGS
A. Physical characteristics in vortex interaction
Cheng et_al [17] have plotted the Re–h_{0} (Re Reynolds number, h_{0} initial spacing) parameter space to illustrate the importance of initial spacing and vortex radii to the success of leapfrogging. In experiments, the interval between the two vortex rings has a significant effect on the behaviour of the leapfrogging process [12]. The main focus is the relationship between the interacting phenomena, which is indeed the motion of vortex rings, and their initial status. Theoretically, referring to the Biot-Savart law, the velocity field ux for incompressible flows induced by a specific vorticity distribution ωx is expressed as
where r = x − x′ and r = |r| [35]. The induced radial velocity v_{r} depends on its axial distance to the core region of the vortex ring that affects it in the wake. The induced axial velocity v_{a} also depends on its radial distance to the vortex core. In the simple physical model proposed by Cheng et_al [17], the self-induced velocity and induced velocity take vortex radii and spacing into account. Therefore, the study of the characteristics of the multiple vortex rings plays an important role in further exploring the interaction mechanism. Gathering the merit of the past studies and the inspiration from the Biot-Savart law, the contribution to the interaction mechanism may direct to some of the physical characteristics of vortex rings, i.e., vortex spacing and radii.
Figure 7 presents the relationship between the differences in vortex radii Δr and axial spacing between the vortex rings Δd at the stroke ends for cases of L/D = 1 and L/D = 2. The dimensionless parameters Δr/r_{0} and Δd/r_{0} are used, where r_{0} is the nozzle inner radius. The directions of Δr and Δd are marked in Fig. 7, which are from the nearest vortex ring to the formed one. This direction is similar to that introduced in the Biot-Savart law. From the flow fields, Δr can be a positive or negative value, while Δd is always positive for all the cases.
In Fig. 7(a), the nodes of experiment 1 seem random. Δr is positive for the second and third generated vortex rings and negative for the fourth and fifth vortex rings. Δd could be large for the third vortex ring, and small for the fourth and fifth ones. However, the results of experiment 2 are regular. Δr decreases as the spacing Δd increases when the interval time Δt ranges from 0 s to 1.5 s. From Δt = 1.5 s, Δr keeps almost constant with the increasing interval spacing. It should be noticed that Δr is negative for the cases that Δt is larger than 1.0 s, which means that the radius of the front vortex ring is smaller than that of the rear forming one. For L/D = 1, an isolated vortex ring will shrink in its radius after the formation process in order to maintain a stable status during its evolution process.
For the cases of L/D = 2, the results in experiment 1 are also complicated, as shown in Fig. 7(b). Considering the third vortex ring in case 2-3-0, the former two vortex rings are in the process of merger. Thus, the radius of the outer vortex ring is large, causing the value of Δr to be larger than that of other cases. For the fourth and fifth vortex rings, however, the value of Δr and Δd is close to each other. Indicated from the FTLE field of case 2-5-0 (due to the limit of visualization window, only the third, fourth, and fifth vortex rings are shown), the later three generated vortex rings are of similar vortex structures. These vortex rings distribute in a row and will not merge in a later evolution process. In experiment 2, Δr also decreases as the spacing Δd increases with increasing interval time Δt, which is similar to that of L/D = 1.
Two major differences exist between the cases of L/D = 1 and L/D = 2 in experiment 2. The first one is that in the cases of L/D = 2, there is no obvious stage that Δr keeps constant. It is possible that the interval time is not long enough for L/D = 2. The other difference is that Δr can be negative for L/D = 1, while it can only reach around zero for L/D = 2. The vortex rings shrink in radius after the formation process for L/D = 1 (relatively smaller formation time), whereas in the cases of relatively larger formation time (L/D = 2 and also L/D > 2), the vortex rings maintain stable without shrinking. Thus, these two groups of cases (L/D = 1 and L/D = 2) represent the whole situations of vortex interaction in which pinch-off does not happen.
B. Circulation related to vortex radii and interval spacing
As mentioned in Sec. IV C the formation modes are separated by the circulation of the forming vortex rings at the stroke ends. There also exist some differences in the characteristics of the vortex rings, especially the radii and interval spacing between them. Therefore, it is believed that some relationships exist between the circulation and characteristics of vortex rings. The circulation change due to vortex interaction Γ_{i−interact} of the ith vortex ring is defined as the difference between the circulation of the forming vortex ring at the stroke end Γ_{i} and that of a single vortex ring with the same formation time Γ_{i−form}, written as
Figure 8 shows a potential relationship between the circulation change Γ_{i−interact} and Δr as well as Δd. Cases of L/D = 1 and L/D = 2 are plotted separately. The parameter Δr/Δd^{2} is chosen as the variable of the x-axis. This parameter will be also discussed in Sec. V C in order to specify its physical definition. As shown in Fig. 8, the circulation change due to the vortex interaction decreases as Δr/Δd^{2} increases for the cases of both formation times. The nodes of the FEM are relatively centralized, whereas those of the FRM are dispersive. Some of the nodes, however, are off the lines of decreasing trends. Δr/Δd^{2} can show the effects of vortex interaction, whereas only combining the radii of vortex rings and spacing between vortices is not enough to comprehensively explain the distinct formation modes in vortex interaction.
C. A unified mechanism for the interaction of multiple vortex rings
The total circulation of the flow field is considered as the breakthrough point in multiple vortex ring flows. The roll-up of the vortex rings is affected by the jet issued from the nozzle and induced velocity field of the vortex rings existing in the wake. Therefore, the total circulation of the flow field containing n vortex rings can be divided into two parts: vortex-formation and vortex-interaction related parts,
where Γ_{i−form} is the circulation of the ith vortex ring due to formation and Γ_{i−interact} is the circulation of the ith vortex ring due to interaction with other vortex rings in the flow field. It should be noticed that according to Helmholtz laws and the results discussed in Sec. IV A, the vorticity in an ideal barotropic fluid is conservative. The only reason causing circulation dissipation is the existence of viscosity. Thus, the total circulation of the entire multiple vortex ring flows maintains slight dissipation due to viscosity.
The term Γ_{i−form} is the circulation of a vortex ring due to formation in an isolated flow field, which is the result of the effect of over-pressure in the slug model [7]. Based on the studies of the universal time scale in the vortex formation [36,37], Γ_{i−form} is a function of the dimensionless formation time of the ith vortex ring Ti*. Although the interaction can affect the state of vortex rings in the formation process, the formation itself is the only determinant in the size of the vortex ring,
where D_{0} is the nozzle diameter, U_{0} is the jet characteristic velocity, and a is a constant factor.
Referring to the Biot-Savart law, the induced radial velocity v_{r} depends on its axial distance to the core region of the vortex ring that affects it in the wake and the magnitude and distribution of vorticity in the vortex ring. The induced axial velocity v_{a} also depends on its radial distance to the vortex core. The vorticity distribution of a vortex ring in unsteady multiple vortex ring flows is difficult to determine. With appropriate simplification, the details of the vorticity magnitude and distribution in the vortex ring that affects the forming vortex ring can be accounted for by its integration, i.e., the circulation. Thus, for the forming vortex ring, the induced velocity v_{i} is determined by three parameters, the axial distance to the core region of the vortex ring related to the forming vortex ring Δd, the radial distance to the vortex core Δr, and its circulation. The previous studies on the parameters that determine the successful leapfrogging of vortex rings have already confirmed the importance of some of the parameters simplified from the Biot-Savart law. The initial spacing between two vortex rings [10–12] is similar to the axial distance to the core region of the vortex ring related to the forming vortex ring Δd. The ratio of core to toroidal radius [12] is one part of the vortex circulation.
In multiple vortex ring flows, the ith vortex ring undoubtedly interacts with the other vortex rings in the wake. The change of circulation due to the interaction on the ith vortex ring is related to induced velocity, which can be simplified and written as
where k → i represents the interaction of the kth vortex ring upon the ith one.
The mechanism of each interaction of dual vortex rings in a multiple vortex flow field is the same because they all result from the induced effect. Thus, the other parameters must be a result of induced effect, which should be independent of vortex formation. Each interaction between dual vortex rings should be representative of a interaction number (Tk→i*). The total effects of vortex interaction on the circulation of the ith vortex ring can be written as
Indicated from the above equation, it seems that the interaction numbers are not unique in multiple vortex ring flows. Figure 9 gives an example of the interaction numbers in multiple vortex ring flows. For V3, the interaction number are T1→3* and T2→3*. Combined V1 and V2 as a whole, however, there exists a point that is the center of the induced effect to the forming vortex ring, marked in Fig. 9. Therefore, considering the ith forming vortex ring, the circulation due to the vortex interaction is written as
A dimensionless number can be identified based on the above study, which is named structure stretching number S^{*},
The total circulation of the vortex rings in the wake that affects the forming vortex ring Γ_{Σ} represents the vorticity strength in the interaction. The radial difference between the center of total induced effect and the forming vortex ring Δr_{center} distinguishes the expansion and compression induced effect. The axial spacing Δd_{center} is the axial stretching effect on the forming vortex ring. The jet characteristic velocity U_{0} represents the internal strength of the forming vortex ring. The structure stretching number S^{*} reflects the interaction mechanism in multiple vortex ring flows and evaluates the induced effect of the vortices in the wake on the formation of a vortex ring.
In general, all the vortex rings should be theoretically taken into account in multiple vortex ring flows when determining the variables Γ_{Σ}, Δr_{center}, and Δd_{center}. It is, however, a tough and cumbersome work to include all the induced effects. R-LCSs here can reduce the calculation work based on mathematics and physics. S^{*} should be zero if the r-LCSs of the vortex rings are closed in front of the investigated one from the beginning of its formation, where no flux transport exists. For the cases of connected r-LCSs between vortex rings, as shown in Fig. 3, all the vortex rings connected to the investigated one should be taken into account when calculating S^{*}. The ridges of forward- and backward-time FTLE form a boundary for calculation, combined with the line connecting the intersections of forward- and backward-time FTLE ridges between the investigated vortex ring and the ring in the front. The black line in Fig. 9 shows the boundary for calculating Γ_{Σ} and the coordinate of the center point for V3. The coordinate of the center point (x_{center}, y_{center}) is the vorticity-weighted arithmetical average in this region. Therefore, Δr_{center} and Δd_{center} can be easily calculated. S^{*} is then calculated from Eq. (11).
In addition, for some transition cases such as case 3-2-0, the vortex rings whose r-LCSs are connected to the investigated one should be considered when calculating S^{*}, and S^{*} keeps the instantaneous value when the r-LCSs are disconnected. For example, if the r-LCSs are connected among n vortex rings, the calculation of S^{*} for the last vortex ring should involve all the (n − 1) rings in the front. If the r-LCSs are broken between the mth and (m + 1)th rings, the calculation of S^{*} for the last vortex ring involves the (m − 1) rings in the front.
D. A criterion for distinguishing formation modes in multiple vortex interaction
The variation of relative circulation gain due to the vortex interaction as a function of the structure stretching number S^{*} in experiment 2 of both L/D = 1 and L/D = 2 is first studied because only two vortex rings exist in the flow fields. Figure 10 presents the relationship between the circulation change due to vortex interaction and structure stretching number. Here, the dimensionless variable of circulation augmentation Γ_{i−interact}/Γ_{i−form} is applied instead of Γ_{i−interact} or Γ_{i−interact}/U_{0}D_{0} in order to figure out the relative gain of vortex interaction that brings to the total circulation compared with that of an isolated vortex ring. With increasing S^{*}, the relative gain of circulation due to interaction decreases for cases of both L/D, and the slopes are almost the same. The relative circulation gain in experiment 1 is then studied. It is shown that the nodes are nearly consistent with those in experiment 2.
The line of Γ_{i−interact}/Γ_{i−form} = 0 distinguishes the two formation modes. In Fig. 10, the augmentation of circulation reaches up to 10% for the FEM, and S^{*} is within a relatively narrow range. By contrast, the circulation is decreased for at most 20% for the FRM. As presented in Fig. 10, a limiting structure stretching number (written as SL*) exists, which distinguishes the two formation modes. SL* is zero for distinguishing the formation modes if there is no transition from strong to weak interaction in the formation process. The limiting structure stretching number SL*, however, is equal to (2 ± 0.4) × 10^{−4} because transition cases exist. The FEM for the forming vortex ring in multiple vortex ring flows happens when S^{*} is smaller than SL*, otherwise the FRM exists. This quantitative result regarding the distinction of two formation modes may suggest a criterion for determining the limits that the vortex interaction can reach.
Moreover, the formation modes represent the vortex dynamics as a whole, which includes the concepts of circulation, impulse, and transient force. The structure stretching number S^{*}, which reflects the interaction mechanism in multiple vortex ring flows, is a criterion of physical meanings for distinguishing the formation modes. Further study on the formation modes and S^{*} could shed light on the contribution of vortex interaction to vortex dynamics.
E. A unified interaction mechanism in nature
Vortex interaction is actually one of the intrinsic components in biological propulsion, such as propulsion of jellyfish [1], swimming of fishes [2,3], hovering of insects [4], and some group locomotion of animals [3,5]. The flow structures in the wake of their locomotion are similar, where multiple co-rotating vortex rings interact with each other. The simplified model, such as multiple co-axial co-rotating vortex rings, is a canonical problem for the study of vortex interaction.
The effects of the Reynolds number and vortex core sizes should be taken into account when applying S^{*} to explain the vortex interaction in biological propulsion. The results of Weigand and Gharib [38] and Sullivan et_al [39] show that thin-core vortex rings have similarity in vortex dynamics within the range of laminar vortex rings. It is indicated that S^{*} could be applied to the vortex interaction mechanisms in some biological propulsion.
Jellyfish is taken as an example, as shown in Fig. 11. Dabiri [37] has confirmed the optimal vortex formation in piston-cylinder experiments can be applied to some biological propulsion, such as squid jet propulsion and jellyfish (N. bachei) swimming. It is also compared in Fig. 11 between panels (a) and (c). However, a considerable number of biological locomotion cannot be included in the area of optimal vortex formation, where the vortex interaction should be considered. Since the experimental approaches in Dabiri’s work [37] and in our experiments are the same, our study on the canonical problems of multiple co-axial co-rotating vortex rings is also believed suitable for investigating the interaction mechanisms in jellyfish (A. aurita) swimming [1] and other similar animals’ locomotion [4]. Comparing Figs. 11(b) and 11(d) and also referring to the vortex rings in the work of Gemmell et_al [1] and in our experiments, the flow structures are extremely similar.
One may speculate that the structure stretching number could be applied to these vortex-interacting situations in nature. The definition of S^{*} and the interaction mechanism are unified and could shed light on the understanding of biological propulsion because our study is based on the physical and mathematical analyses of the vortex ring flows. In nature, the vortex rings are not axisymmetric or co-axial. There may also exist an angle between the vortex rings. The value of S^{*} and SL*, however, would be subject to varying due to the different and more complicated types of flows.
The existence of structure stretching number S^{*} greatly enriches the potential vortex-caused optimal problems besides the optimal formation only determined by the formation time. Further exploring animals’ behaviours, which enhances the vortices or controls the position, in view of the flow-based mechanisms (formation time and structure stretching number) is important to understand the high-efficient movement from both ecological and design perspectives as well as to provide essential design rules of vortex dynamics for creating successful biomimetic propulsors.
VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS AND DISCUSSION
Experiments are conducted to examine the motion and dynamics of multiple co-axial co-rotating vortex rings. The vortex rings, which have the same formation time, are successively generated in a piston-cylinder apparatus. Two types of vortex interactions are defined by investigating the repelling Lagrangian coherent structures (r-LCSs), which are strong and weak interactions. Strong interaction is indicated by the connected r-LCSs, inside which a channel is opened for fluid transport (termed as “flux window”). Leapfrogging and merger of vortex rings can happen in the later stage of the evolution process. For weak interaction, the r-LCSs are disconnected, and the vortex rings are separated. Although the formation time and interval time are the same for a chain of successively generated vortex rings, there exist significant differences in the circulation of each vortex ring. Two distinct formation modes are identified. For the formation enhancement mode (FEM), the circulation of a vortex ring affected by vortex interaction is larger than that of an isolated vortex ring. For the formation restraint mode (FRM), the situation is opposite. Originating from the Biot-Savart law, a dimensionless number reflecting the interaction mechanism is proposed, referred to as “structure stretching number.” It can evaluate the induced effect of the vortices in the wake on the formation of the vortex ring in multiple interacting vortex ring flows. The limiting structure stretching number (SL*=(2±0.4)×10^{−4}) is found, which can distinguish the two formation modes. The augmentation of circulation reaches up to 10% for the FEM when S^{*}<SL*, while in the FRM (S^{*}>SL*), the circulation decreases for at most 20%.
Some of the flow structures in biological propulsion, especially the vortex rings in the wake of jellyfish (A. aurita) [1] and the three-dimensional vortex wake structure of flapping wings in hovering flight [4], are similar to the experimental results in this paper. Vortex interaction plays an essential role in the force and energy capture. It is suggested that the structure stretching number S^{*} in multiple vortex interaction can be regarded as the underlying mechanism for vortex-caused enhancement in nature. Further exploration based on the interaction of flow structures is necessary to fully understand animals’ high-efficient movement and provide essential design rules of vortex dynamics for creating successful biomimetic propulsors.
