Magnetosonic solitons in semiconductor plasmas in the presence of quantum tunneling and exchange correlation effects
Low frequency magnetosonic wave excitations are investigated in semiconductor hole-electron plasmas. The quantum mechanical effects such as Fermi pressure, quantum tunneling, and exchange-correlation of holes and electrons in the presence of the magnetic field are considered. The two fluid quantum magnetohydrodynamic model is used to study magnetosonic wave dynamics, while electric and magnetic fields are coupled via Maxwell equations. The dispersion relation of the magnetosonic wave in electron-hole semiconductor plasma propagating in the perpendicular direction of the magnetic field is obtained, and its dispersion effects are discussed. The Korteweg-de Vries equation (KdV) for magnetosonic solitons is derived by employing the reductive perturbation method. For numerical analysis, the plasma parameters are taken from the semiconductors such as GaAs, GaSb, GaN, and InP already existing in the literature. It is found that the phase velocity of the magnetosonic wave is increased with the inclusion of exchange-correlation force in the model. The soliton dip structures of the magnetosonic wave in GaN semiconductor plasma are obtained, which satisfy the quantum plasma conditions for electron and hole fluids. The magnetosonic soliton dip structures move with speed less than the magnetosonic wave phase speed in the lab frame. The effects of exchange-correlation force in the model and variations of magnetic field intensity and electron/hole density on the magnetosonic wave dip structures are also investigated numerically for illustration.
I. INTRODUCTION
The study of quantum plasma has gained attention during the last decade due to its many applications on large scale systems such as white dwarfs and neutron stars containing dense plasmas and short scale systems such as in semiconductors and quantum devices and on nanometer scales such as quantum wells, quantum dots, nano-tubes, and spintronics [1–6]. In semiconductors, although the electron density is much less than in metals, the quantum effects appear due to miniaturization of today's electronic components. The electron-hole plasmas are created as a result of the interaction between laser pulses and matter. Electrons from the valence band absorb energy during this interaction and excite to the conduction band via the single or multiphoton absorption depending on the photon and bandgap energy. The holes are created in the valence band as a result of this inter-band transition of electrons to the conduction band [7]. The electron and hole fluids in semiconductors behave as a quantum plasma when Fermi temperatures of the electron and hole become greater than the system temperature and they obey Fermi-Dirac statistics. Also, the quantum effects in semiconductors become important when the de-Broglie wavelength associated with the electrons/holes is comparable to their interparticle distance. Therefore, in order to study the short scale collective effects, the quantum hydrodynamic (QHD) model is used, which remains valid when the length scales are larger in comparison to Fermi lengths of the species. The QHD model generalizes the fluid model which contains degenerate pressure effects due to Pauli's exclusion principle, and quantum tunneling effects appear due to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. The exchange-correlation effects appear due to the wave function of indistinguishable particles subject to the exchange symmetry. It has also been derived that exchange interactions between indistinguishable particles (fermions having 1/2 spin nature) with the same spin direction and particles with the opposite spin direction are different due to their total antisymmetry of their wave function [8]. The exchange potential between degenerate electrons and holes occurs due to the same (parallel) spins, i.e., having repulsion not only via their electronic charges through Coulomb force. The correlation potential is defined opposite to exchange potential because it defines the correlation motion between electrons and holes of antiparallel spins and they are more likely to occupy their nearby locations to reduce the mutual Coulomb repulsion. Therefore, the inclusion of the exchange-correlation effects in the QHD model plays an important role in the dynamics and total energy of the semi-conductor quantum plasma system [9]. Many authors have already studied the electrostatic and electromagnetic plasma waves in dense laboratory and astrophysical plasmas consisting of non-interacting electron gas by taking into account the quantum degeneracy and tunneling effects and explored the different features of plasma waves on short scales [10–17] and reference therein. However, the Coulomb exchange interactions and correlation effects become important in dense plasmas and in the presence of the magnetic field. Therefore, in semiconductor electron and hole quantum plasmas, the possibility of their wave functions can overlap and exchange correlation effects play an important role in transfer of energy [18,19], and these effects cannot be ignored in the system.
Acoustic solitons have been recently observed in different systems such as Si, Sapphire, MgO, and alpha-quartz, and these acoustic waves could lead to the formation of sub-picosecond acoustic pulses. The excitation of acoustic solitons in a GaAs crystalline slab has been reported, and a short picosecond acoustic pulse was generated by absorption of a femtosecond laser pulse in an aluminum thin film deposited on one side of the slab [20]. Moslem et_al [21] studied the electrostatic solitary acoustic pulses in electron-hole semiconductor plasmas with the inclusion of Fermi pressure, quantum tunneling, and exchange correlation effects. The authors applied their theoretical findings to semiconductors GaAs, GaSb, GaN, and InP and concluded that features of nonlinear acoustic waves are different depending on the dielectric constant of the semiconductor and plasma parameters [21]. Ourabah and Tribeche [22] studied the nonlinear electrostatic wave structures in dense plasmas by including the exchange and correlation effects using the quantum plasma model. The pseudo potential analysis was done to show that the exchange-correlation effects modify the phase speed of the wave and also affect the amplitude of compressive or rarefactive quantum ion acoustic solitons. The electron-hole two stream instability in a quantum semi-conductor plasma with exchange correlation effects has been investigated [23]. The effects of electron and hole-phonon collision, quantum recoil effects, streaming velocities, and corresponding threshold on the growth rate of electrostatic instability were studied numerically in GaAs and GaSb semiconductors. The propagation of electrostatic waves has also been studied in nanosized GaAs semiconductor electron-hole plasma induced by the electron beam. It is reported that electrostatic modes become unstable which strongly depend on electron beam parameter as well as quantum recoil effects, degenerate pressure, and exchange-correlation effects in a semiconductor plasma [9]. One dimensional electrostatic rarefactive solitons are studied in GaAs, GaSb, and GaN semiconductor electron and hole plasmas [7]. The plasma system is governed by two coupled nonlinear Schrödinger equations (NLS) for the collective wave functions of the electrons and holes and Poisson's equation for the electrostatic potential. The system is closed by including the effects of charge separation between the electrons and holes, quantum tunneling, quantum statistics, and exchange correlation due to electron spin. The quasi-stationary soliton solutions were obtained numerically in terms of depleted electron and hole densities. The simulation results showed that the rarefactive solitons are stable and could withstand perturbations and turbulence for a considerable time. The amplitude modulation of compressional Alfvén waves in electron-hole semiconductor quantum plasmas has been investigated using the QHD model with the inclusion of exchange-correlation effects for GaAs, GaSb, and GaN semiconductors [24].
The objective of this work is to investigate the low frequency magnetosonic wave excitations in electron-hole semiconductor plasmas, which has not been done yet. The two fluid quantum magnetohydrodynamic (QMHD) model is applied to study magnetosonic wave propagation in electron-hole semiconductor plasmas, and quantum statistical pressure, Bohm potential, and exchange-correlation potential effects of degenerate holes and electrons fluids are included in their momentum equations. The continuity and momentum equations of hole and electron fluids with Maxwell's equations are presented in Sec. II. The scaling for normalization of the variables in the set of dynamic equations is given in Sec. III. The dispersion relation of the magnetosonic waves in electron-hole semiconductor plasmas is obtained by applying Fourier analyses in Sec. IV. By using the reductive perturbation method, the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation for magnetosonic solitons in electron-hole semiconductor plasmas is derived in Sec. V. The exchange-correlation potential effects appear in the nonlinear and dispersive coefficients of the KdV equation. The numerical analysis is performed by taking different semiconductor parameters, and discussion on the obtained results is elaborated in Sec. VI. A brief summary of the findings is presented in Sec. VII.
II. SET OF DYNAMIC EQUATIONS
The two fluid quantum hydrodynamic model is used to study many body Coulomb exchange interactions in electron and hole semiconductor magnetized plasma. The holes and electrons obey Fermi-Dirac statistics in semiconductor plasmas, when Fermi temperatures of the electrons and holes are much larger than the system temperature. In order to study magnetohydrodynamics (or magnetosonic) waves in a semiconductor electron and hole plasma, the set of quantum magnetohydrodynamic fluid equations with Maxwell equations are described as follows:
The continuity and momentum equations for hole quantum fluid are written as
The continuity and the momentum equations for electron quantum fluid are given by
In the above momentum equations, mh∗ is the effective mass of holes and me∗ is the effective mass of electrons. Three quantum mechanical effects are taken into account in the above degenerate electron and hole fluid momentum equations, which are described below:
(i) First, the pressure or temperature degeneracy effect of holes and electrons obeying Fermi-Dirac distribution is taken due to Pauli's exclusion principle. The Fermi pressure of holes and electrons is given as p_{Fj}=(2/5n02/3)ε_{Fj}nj5/3, where ε_{Fj}=k_{B}T_{Fj} is the Fermi energy of the jth particle (here, j = h, e) [25,26]. It reflects that the system equilibrium assuming local zero-temperature is fully 3D due to Fermi-Dirac distribution, whereas non-equilibrium only affects the direction normal to the surface of quantum plasma system for one dimensional wave propagation [19–23,27] and references therein. The Fermi temperature is related to density of degenerate holes and electrons T_{Fj}=ℏ^{2}(3π2n0){2/3}/2mj∗k_{B}, where k_{B} is the Boltzmann constant, ℏ is the scaled-Planck's constant, and n_{0} is the equilibrium density defined as n_{h0}=n_{e0} (say n_{0}). The Fermi temperatures of electrons and holes are not the same as there is a difference between their mass, and generally, hole mass is ten times greater than the electron mass in a semiconductor.
(ii) Second, the exchange and correlation potential effects of holes and electrons in a semiconductor plasma are considered due to their 1/2 spin Fermionic nature. This exchange and correlation potential appears due to the wave function of electrons/holes subject to their exchange symmetry having parallel or antiparallel spins. The exchange and correlation potential obtained under adiabatic local density approximation and described as a function of electron and hole densities is given by V_{xcj}=−0.985nj1/3ϵ[1+0.034aB∗nj1/3ln(1+18.37aB∗nj1/3)] [28–30], where aB∗=ℏ^{2}ϵ/mj∗e^{2} is the effective Bohr atomic radius, mj∗ is the effective masses of electron or hole, and ϵ is the effective dielectric constant of the semiconductor material. In the limit 18.37aB∗nj1/3≪1 and using the Taylor's expansion, the exchange-correlation potential can be obtained in the simple form V_{xcj}=−1.6e^{2}ϵnj1/3+5.65ℏ^{2}mj∗nj2/3, which has been used in the calculations.
(iii) The third effect is taken due to quantum tunnelling or Bohm force in a quantum plasma, which appears in a semiconductor plasma because of wave like nature of holes and electrons by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, i.e., F_{Q}=(19)ℏ^{2}2mj∗∇(1n_{j}∇^{2}n_{j}). The factor (1/9) appears for consistency of the kinetic theory with the fluid quantum hydrodynamic model [25,26]. Here, subscript j stands for both the electron and the hole, i.e., (e,h).
The electric and magnetic fields are related by the Maxwell's equations written as follows:
Here, B and E are the magnetic and electric field vectors, respectively, and c is the speed of light in vacuum. In the low frequency limit, i.e., ω≪Ω_{i} (where Ω_{i} is the ion gyrofrequency), the term due to displacement current is neglected in Eq. (6) under the assumption that wave phase velocity is much less than the speed of light. The current density is defined as
The neutrality condition under plasma approximation gives n_{h}≃n_{e}.
III. SCALING FOR NORMALIZATION OF MODEL EQUATIONS
The normalized set of dynamic equations for magnetosonic waves in electron-hole semiconductor plasmas is written as follows:
The normalization of spatial and temporal scales is defined as r´=rλ_{Fe},t´=tω_{ph}, where λ_{Fe} is the electron Fermi length and ω_{ph} is the hole-plasma frequency. The normalized electric and magnetic fields are defined as E´=eEmh∗c_{s}ω_{ph} and B´=BB_{0}, where ω_{ph}=4πn_{0}e^{2}mh∗ and λ_{Fe}=k_{B}T_{Fe}4πn_{0}e^{2}. The quantum diffraction parameter is defined as H=ℏω_{pe}mh∗cs2, where ω_{pe}=4πn_{0}e^{2}me∗ is the electron plasma frequency, M=mh∗me∗ (hole to electron effective mass ratio), σ=T_{Fh}T_{Fe} (i.e., ratio of Fermi temperature of the hole and electron), and Ω=Ω_{h}ω_{ph} (i.e., the ratio of hole-cyclotron frequency to hole-plasma frequency, where Ω_{h}=eB_{0}mh∗c),γ_{1}=1.6e^{2}n01/33m_{h}ϵcs2,γ_{2}=(23)5.65ℏ^{2}n02/3mh∗2cs2,γ_{3}=1.6e^{2}n01/33me∗ϵcs2, and γ_{4}=(23)5.65ℏ^{2}n02/3me∗2cs2. The electron inertial length is defined as λ_{e}=cω_{pe} and c_{s}=k_{B}T_{Fe}mh∗ is the hole-acoustic speed in semiconductor plasmas. Also, Ω^{2}c^{2}=vA2, where v_{A}=B_{0}4πn_{0}mh∗ is the Alfvén wave speed of the holes. The plasma beta is defined as β=cs2vA2. The dashed (´) sign shown on the normalized independent and dependent variables in the above Eqs. (8)–(13) has been removed in further calculations for simplicity.
Now assuming that the magnetosonic wave is propagating in the x direction, i.e., ∇=(∂_{x},0,0), the electric field is lying in the XY-plane, i.e., E=E_{x}(x,t)ı̂+E_{y}(x,t)ȷ̂ and velocity of the hole and electron fluid is v_{j}=v_{jx}(x,t)x̂+v_{jy}(x,t)ŷ, while the magnetic field is directed along the z-axis. The above set of dynamic equations (8)–(13) can be written in the component form as follows:
The hole continuity equation is given by
The x and y components of the hole momentum equation in the presence of exchange-correlation potential are written as
The continuity equation for degenerate electrons is given by
The x and y components of the momentum equation for the degenerate electrons in the presence of exchange-correlation potential are written as
The z component of the Faraday's law yields
The x and y components of Ampere's law give
IV. DISPERSION RELATION
We derive the dispersion relation for the magnetosonic waves propagating along the x axis, i.e., ∇=(∂_{x},0,0), i.e., in the perpendicular direction of the magnetic field. The magnetic field is taken along the z axis, i.e., B=B(x,t)ẑ=B_{0}ẑ+B_{z}(x,t)ẑ. The density and velocity are represented by n_{j}(x,t), while the velocity is v_{j}=v_{jx}(x,t)x̂+v_{jy}(x,t)ŷ. The electric field is lying in the XY-plane E=E_{x}(x,t)ı̂+E_{y}(x,t)ȷ̂. Suppose that perturbations n^{(1)},B^{(1)}, vhx(1),vhy(1),Ex(1), and Ey(1) are proportional to exp(ikx−iωt), where ω and k are the wave frequency and the perpendicular component of wave vector, respectively.
The following dispersion relation is obtained by solving Eqs. (1)–(7):
The third and fourth terms on the right hand side in (23) appear due to exchange-correlation effects in electron and hole semiconductor plasmas.
In the dimensionless form, the dispersion relation (23) for magnetosonic waves in electron-hole semiconductor plasma can be written as
The wave frequency ω is normalized with hole-plasma frequency ω_{ph} and wave number k is normalized with electron Fermi length λ_{Fe}. The dimensionless quantities H, M, σ, Ω, γ_{1}, γ_{2}, γ_{3}, and γ_{4} are defined after Eq. (13), where γ_{1}, γ_{2}, γ_{3}, and γ_{4} appear due to the inclusion of exchange-correlation effects in degenerate hole and electron gas. It can be seen from Eq. (24) that the dispersive effects appear due to the electron inertial length and Bohm potential. The exchange-correlation effects only change the phase speed of the wave and have no dispersion effects in the system.
V. DERIVATION OF KORTEWEG-DE VRIES EQUATION
In this section, the KdV equation is derived to study the effects of exchange-correlation potential of holes and electrons on the nonlinear magnetosonic wave structure in semiconductor plasmas. The well known reductive perturbation method is employed [31] to derive the KdV equation. The spatial and temporal coordinates are stretched as follows:
Here, ε is a small expansion parameter, which characterizes the strength of nonlinearity, and λ is the phase velocity of the wave to be determined later on.
We expand the system's dependent variables n_{h}, n_{e}, v_{hx}, v_{ex}, and B in terms of the smallness parameter ε as follows:
while for v_{hy}, v_{ey}, and E_{x}, we have
Now, we apply the above perturbation scheme in Eqs. (14)–(22) and collect lowest order terms. On solving the lowest order set of equations, the normalized phase velocity, i.e., λ of the magnetosonic waves is obtained in the following form:
The normalized phase velocity of the magnetosonic waves in a semiconductor plasma is modified in the presence of exchange-correlation terms defined in terms of γ_{1}, γ_{2}, γ_{3,} and γ_{4} of holes and electrons, respectively. In the long wavelength or wave limit, Eq. (24) gives the same normalized phase speed of the magnetosonic waves as derived in Eq. (26). In further calculations, we will take only positive values of the phase velocity λ without loss of generality.
From the lowest order, the variables v_{hx1},n_{h1},B_{z1}, E_{x1},v_{hy1},v_{ey1} can be written in terms of v_{ex1} as follows:
Now collecting the next higher order terms (ε^{5/2}) of the ion continuity and x, y components of the ion momentum equation gives the following set of equations:
The next higher order terms (ε^{5/2}) of the electron continuity and the x and y components of the electron momentum equation give the following set of partial differential equations:
The next higher order terms (ε^{5/2}) of the Faraday's law yields
The next higher order terms (ε^{2}) of the x component of Ampere's law gives
The next higher order terms (ε^{5/2}) of the y component of Ampere's law yields
Finally, eliminating n_{h2},v_{hx2},v_{hy2} and E_{y2},B_{z2}, n_{e2},v_{ex2},v_{ey2} from Eqs. (33)–(40) and using the relation given in Eq. (26), we obtain the KdV equation for the nonlinear magnetosonic waves in semiconductor electron and hole magnetized plasmas with exchange-correlation potential effects in terms of dependent variable n_{h1} as follows:
where nonlinear and dispersive coefficients a and b are defined as
where
In order to find the solitary wave solution of Eq. (42), we use the transformation η=ξ−U_{0}τ for a co-moving frame with velocity U_{0} of the nonlinear wave structure which is normalized with hole-acoustic speed c_{s}. After integration and simplification of Eq. (42), we obtained soliton solution [32] as follows:
where Ψ_{0} and W represent the peak amplitude and the width of the soliton, respectively, i.e.,
It can be seen from Eqs. (43) and (44) that quantum effects modify the nonlinear and dispersion coefficients of the KdV equation (42). The exchange-correlation potential modifies the phase velocity of the magnetosonic wave and nonlinear and dispersive coefficients in the KdV equation, whereas quantum tunneling effects of holes and electrons appear in the dispersive coefficient.
VI. NUMERICAL PLOTS AND DISCUSSION
In this section, we will numerically study the effects of variations of different parameters of electron-hole semiconductor plasma on the propagation characteristics of magnetosonic waves. The four semiconductors such as GaAs, GaSb, GaN, and InP are chosen for numerical investigations in magnetized electron-hole semiconductor plasma existing in the literature. The typical parameters such as electron and hole density, effective masses of the electron and hole, and dielectric constant of the semiconductors at the bulk temperature T = 300 K (room temperature) are given in Table I [24,33,34].
The numerical plots of phase velocity of the magnetosonic waves (26) for electron-hole semiconductor plasmas in the presence and absence of exchange-correlation potential effects in different semiconductors are shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b), respectively. In order to obtain numerical plots for illustration, the electron/hole semiconductor plasma density and magnetic field intensity are varied in the range of 10^{17}–10^{20} cm^{−3} and 10–4k G [35], respectively. Figure 1(a) is plotted by taking the plasma parameters of the GaN semiconductor. It can be seen from the figure that in the presence of exchange-correlation force in the momentum equations for electrons and holes in the model, the phase velocity of the magnetosonic waves is enhanced with the increase in the plasma density. The phase speed of the magnetosonic waves in different semiconductor electron-hole plasmas is shown in Fig. 1(b). It is evident from Fig. 1(b) that at low values of plasma density, the phase velocity of the magnetosonic waves is large for the GaN semiconductor, while in the high density plasma region, the phase velocity of the wave is large for GaSb semiconductor plasmas.
The formation of the magnetosonic wave dip or hump structure depends on both plasma density in the semiconductor and magnetic field intensity. In order to obtain the numerical plots of the magnetosonic soliton structures, we have chosen the plasma parameters for the GaN semiconductor which has an electron/hole density of the order of 10^{19} cm^{−3} and the electron and hole Fermi temperatures T_{Fe},T_{Fh} > T hold to satisfy the quantum plasma condition for our model. The nonlinear and dispersive coefficients of the KdV equation (42) are plotted with variations of electron densities for GaN semiconductor plasma at magnetic field intensities of 120 (dotted curve), 150 (dashed curve), and 200 (solid curve) Gauss in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b), respectively. It can be seen from Fig. 2(a) that the value of the nonlinear coefficient “a” remains positive for all range of the semiconductor plasma density. However, the dispersive coefficient “b” shown in Fig. 2(b) has positive values in the low value plasma density regime ∼10^{17} cm^{−3}, while it also has negative values for the high plasma density region ≥10^{18}cm^{−3} in the semiconductor. Therefore, there is a possibility of formation of soliton dip structures (hole density) of magnetosonic waves in regions of high values of plasma density having negative values of coefficient “b” and the magnetosonic soliton hump structures are formed in regions of low values of plasma density where the dispersive coefficient has positive values. It is also noticed from the plasma density ≥10^{19}cm^{−3} that T_{Fe}, T_{Fh}>T condition holds only for the GaN semiconductor; therefore, according to the valid conditions of the quantum plasmas, only the magnetosonic wave dip structures of hole density can be formed and propagate which carry energy from one region to another in the semiconductor. Similarly, it is also noticed that for magnetic field strength >4k G, the magnetosonic hump structures also appear for values of plasma density ≥10^{19}cm^{−3}, which is not a valid physical range of magnetic field intensity for semiconductor plasmas as described in Ref [36]. The magnetosonic wave soliton dip structures of hole plasma density in GaN semiconductor plasma are shown in Figs. 3(a)–3(c), respectively. Figure 3(a) shows that in the presence of exchange-correlation force in the model, the amplitude and width of the magnetosonic soliton structure are enhanced. The electron/hole density is taken to be 5 × 10^{19} cm^{−3}, magnetic field intensity is 120 G for which Fermi temperatures of the electron and hole come out to be T_{Fe} = 4418 K and T_{Fh} = 442 K (which is greater than T = 300 K), plasma beta comes out to be 2.6 × 10^{4}, and the quantum parameter turns out to be H = 1.91. The effect of variations in plasma density in the GaN semiconductor is shown in Fig. 3(b). It is clear from the figure that with the increase in the plasma density, the amplitude of the magnetosonic wave dip structures enhances while its width is reduced. The effect of variations with the magnetic field intensity is shown in Fig. 3(c), which shows that on increasing the magnetic field intensity, the amplitude and width of the magnetosonic soliton dip structure are found to be decreased.
In order to find the speed of the nonlinear magnetosonic structures in GaN semiconductor electron-hole plasmas, the transformed coordinate η can be written as η=ϵ^{1/2}[x−(λ+εU_{0})τ], where V=λ+εU_{0} is the normalized velocity of the nonlinear magnetosonic wave structure in the lab frame. From Eqs. (43) and (45), one can see that the magnetosonic soliton hump structure is formed when b > 0 at low values of plasma density as shown in Fig. 2(b) for which U_{0} > 0 holds to have a soliton solution, which means V > λ, i.e., nonlinear hump structure moves with speed greater than magnetosonic wave phase speed. However, there is another possibility of formation of magnetosonic wave dip structures as well when b < 0 which occurs at high electron density as shown in Fig. 2(b) and soliton solution exists for U_{0} < 0, which means V < λ, i.e., nonlinear dip structure moves with speed less than the magnetosonic wave phase speed [25,36].
VII. SUMMARY
We have studied the linear and nonlinear propagation of magnetosonic waves in quantum semiconductor electron-hole plasmas with the inclusion of degenerate Fermi pressure, Bohm potential, and exchange-correlation potential effects of both electrons and holes. The dynamics of the semiconductor electron-hole plasma system is governed by two fluid quantum magneto-hydrodynamics and Maxwell's equations. The dispersion relation for the magnetosonic waves in semiconductor electron-hole quantum plasma is obtained by applying Fourier analysis. It is found that wave dispersion effects appear due to Bohm potential effects and electron inertial length. The exchange-correlation effects increase the phase speed of the wave. The phase speed of magnetosonic waves is found to be more in the case of GaSb semiconductor electron-hole plasma in comparison with GaAs, GaN, and InP semiconductors. The Fermi temperature between electrons and holes is different due to the difference in their masses and the hole acoustic speed is defined. By using the reductive perturbation method, the nonlinear analysis is performed to derive the KdV equation for low amplitude magnetosonic solitons. The magnetosonic soliton dip structures are formed in GaN semiconductor plasmas, and they move with speed less than the magnetosonic wave phase speed. The quantum plasma condition, i.e., Fermi temperatures of electrons and holes are found to be greater than the system bulk temperature, holds only in a GaN semiconductor electron-hole plasma, and only magnetosonic wave dip soliton structures are formed. The effects of variations in electron density, magnetic field intensity, and inclusion of exchange-correlation force on nonlinear magnetosonic dip structures are also investigated. The results are useful for understanding the energy transport mechanism in a semiconductor electron-hole plasma in the perpendicular direction of the magnetic field. They may also be applicable to understand the dynamics of semiconductor plasmas to produce high power high band-width devices in analogy which are contrast to the existing gas plasma devices [37].
