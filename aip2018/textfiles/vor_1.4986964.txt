Noncommutative mapping from the symplectic formalism
Bopp’s shifts will be generalized through a symplectic formalism. A special procedure, like “diagonalization,” which drives the completely deformed symplectic matrix to the standard symplectic form was found as suggested by Faddeev-Jackiw. Consequently, the correspondent transformation matrix guides the mapping from commutative to noncommutative (NC) phase-space coordinates. Bopp’s shifts may be directly generalized from this mapping. In this context, all the NC and scale parameters, introduced into the brackets, will be lifted to the Hamiltonian. Well-known results, obtained using ⋆-product, will be reproduced without considering that the NC parameters are small (≪1). Besides, it will be shown that different choices for NC algebra among the symplectic variables generate distinct dynamical systems, in which they may not even connect with each other, and that some of them can preserve, break, or restore the symmetry of the system. Further, we will also discuss the charge and mass rescaling in a simple model.
I. INTRODUCTION
In these last few decades, NC theories have been extensively studied. This happens because some results in string theory [1,2] suggest that space-time coordinates may not commute [3], since it seems to be relevant to the quantization of D-branes in background magnetic (B_{μν}) fields [4,5], and also because NC space-time coordinates are an alternative mechanism for Lorentz-invariance breaking [6–8]. Despite great interest today, the noncommutativity of coordinates is an older idea presented at the beginning of the quantum theory, indeed, in some assumptions on its quantized differential geometry [9,10] or in the description of nonrelativistic electrons of mass m on a plane subject to a strong perpendicular magnetic field B in the lowest Landau level [11]. However, ever since Heisenberg’s paper [12,13] on uncertainty principle, there has been wide hesitancy in considering, simultaneously, classical-valued positions and momenta variables in any meaningful formula expressing quantum behavior since these are incompatible observables. However, Groenewold [14] and Moyal [15] provided an original technical solution to the problem above, i.e., they developed a special binary operation, the *-product, which preserves the classical nature of positions (q_{i}) and momenta (p_{i}) but also permits q_{i} and p_{i} to combine in a way that is equivalent to the familiar operator algebra of the Hilbert space quantum theory. This original technical solution is based on the introduction of a Wigner phase space distribution function [16] with deformed product and brackets (not the Poisson brackets), which correspond to the quantum commutator brackets. Due to this, essential aspects of quantum mechanics can be given a classical formalism in terms of the *-product. The deformation structure in the symplectic space [17] and the uniqueness of this formulation were systematically analyzed and mathematically consolidated [18], and, more recently, it was proved that any finite-dimensional Poisson manifold can be canonically quantized in the sense of deformation quantization [19]. This alternative quantum framework is called Quantum Mechanics in Phase Space (QMPS) [20–23]. Inspired by these articles, we propose a formalization and generalization of Bopp’s shifts based on the NC symplectic induction procedure [24] which begins with the deformation of the brackets among the fields, embraced by the symplectic variables, which is identified as being a general and completely noncommutative deformed symplectic matrix (two-form tensor). This procedure changes the original canonical brackets among the variables, introducing 2n(n − 1) NC and n scale parameters, which rescale the standard Poisson brackets. The transformation matrix among the newer symplectic variables (the NC deformed system) and the older one (original system) are determined from the general and completely noncommutative deformed symplectic matrix. The procedure to reduce a nonconstant deformed symplectic matrix into the standard one allows us to obtain the standard Poisson brackets among the fields, which was pointed out by Faddeev and Jackiw [25]; here we obtain such a “symplecticzation” mechanism. With this mechanism, it is possible to render the NC geometry features into the dynamics since the NC and scale parameters are lifted to the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian. This opens the possibility to investigate NC (quantum) features at the commutative (classical) level. Applying the noncommutative mapping into the n-dimensional dynamical system, the corresponding newer Lagrangian and Hamiltonian might embrace, at the lower energy level, the NC (“quantum”) features into them; at this point, the canonical quantized process can be applied since the new brackets, now, might correspond to the quantum commutators. This paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II, the NC symplectic induction formalism will be presented since it is the base for the mathematical formulation of the noncommutative mapping. In Sec. III, a simplified noncommutative mapping in a 4-dimensional dynamical system will be presented in order to allow a straightforward application in Sec. IV. In Sec. IV, the NC mapping will be applied in some systems in order to illustrate the procedure and also to explore new results. In Sec. V, conclusions will be presented.
II. THE NONCOMMUTATIVE SYMPLECTIC INDUCTION FORMALISM
The symplectic formalism [25] is a powerful tool in the field theory, and it was extended to also deal with constrained systems [26–28], to induce symmetries into non-invariant systems [29–32], and to give an alternative way to introduce the Clebsch parameters [33] into some models. Further, it was also extended to induce noncommutativity into commutative systems [24,34,35]. There are a lot of ways to introduce NC [5,15,36–43] into a system; however, a brief presentation of the NC symplectic induction formalism [24,34,35] will be necessary since Boop’s shifts will be mathematically generalized through the symplectic framework.
A. Setting the structure
One will consider the systems whose dynamical equations can be derived from the general first-order Lagrangian
where the overdot notation was employed for time derivative. Also, the configuration coordinate q̃{i} and its conjugated momenta p̃{i} were arranged in the 2n-component phase-space coordinate as
The arbitrary phase-space dependent functions ã{α}(ξ̃) and H(ξ̃) are, respectively, the FJ (Faddeev-Jackiw) coefficient and the Hamiltonian; the latter behaves as a potential function in a Lagrangian expressed in terms of the phase-space coordinate [44]. We will employ the following notations for derivatives: ∂/∂ξ^{α} ≡ ∂_{α}, ∂/∂ξ̃{α}≡∂̃{α}. Thus, the Euler-Lagrange equation of motion of the Lagrangian given in Eq. (1) can be obtained as
where
which is a general antisymmetric symbol, depending on the phase-space coordinate.
On the other hand, let us consider the Lagrangian
whose equation of motion has the simplest antisymmetric constant symbol,
where f_{αβ} are the elements of the inverse (f^{−1}) of the usual 2n × 2n symplectic matrix
with elements f^{αβ}. Then, the equation of motion of the Lagrangian given in Eq. (5) may be read as
and its components ξ̇{α}=(q̇{i},ṗ{i}) correspond to the usual Hamilton equations of motion. For this constant f_{αβ}, the FJ coefficient a_{α} gets a linear relation,
and the Lagrangian given in Eq. (5) takes the usual shape, which in terms of the phase-space coordinate, disregarding a total time derivative inexpressive in the action of any Lagrangian, may be written as
The Poisson bracket is one of the possible starting points to quantize a theory since the quantum constant ℏ can be introduced through direct replacement of the Poisson bracket by the corresponding commutator: For two classical quantities F(q, p) and G(q, p), this replacement is represented by
where F^ and G^ are the corresponding quantum operators. We can express the Poisson bracket of F(ξ) and G(ξ) through a symplectic formalism with the help of the elements of the symplectic matrix given in Eq. (7) as
From Eq. (12), we can calculate the Poisson brackets of the phase-space coordinates directly as
Putting back this term into Eq. (12), we get
B. Adding noncommutative and scale parameters into the system
One strategy that can be followed to incorporate noncommutativity in the subject is taking Eq. (13) as a starting point, realizing that the elements of f can be sorted by direct Poisson brackets (with i = j), which correspond to the canonical Poisson brackets, and crossed Poisson brackets (with i ≠ j); the latter are given by
Then, we can add NC parameters into the system through a suitable change of basis ξ^{α}→ξ̃{α} (commutative basis → noncommutative basis). So, in order to accomplish this plan, we just need to rescale the direct Poisson brackets and replace the zero elements corresponding to the crossed Poisson brackets by NC parameters according to the problem to be investigated. In the most general way, one must consider that the Poisson brackets on the noncommutative basis may be mapped via the following equation:
where f̃{αβ} are the elements of the full 2n × 2n antisymmetric matrix f̃ whose elements depend on the phase-space coordinate. The matrix f̃ will be the general deformed symplectic matrix on the noncommutative basis. In order to facilitate the presentation, let us briefly restrict to the 2-dimensional configuration space and also employ a new representation for the symplectic matrix where the rows and columns corresponding to q_{2} and p_{1} are swapped. In this new representation, the four-component phase-space coordinate is arranged as ξ^{α} = (q_{1}, p_{1}, q_{2}, p_{2}) and the 4 × 4 symplectic matrix gets the block-diagonal form
where ε is the 2 × 2 antisymmetric matrix whose elements are the two-dimensional Levi-Civita symbol with ε_{12} = 1. So, on the commutative basis, the direct Poisson brackets correspond to the elements of the 2 × 2 ε-matrices in Eq. (17) and the crossed Poisson brackets correspond to the elements of the 2 × 2 null-matrices; on the noncommutative basis, the direct Poisson brackets will be rescaled and the crossed Poisson brackets will be given by
and they can be arranged in a full antisymmetric 4 × 4 matrix f̃ as
where g_{1} and g_{2} are arbitrary scale parameters and Θ is the 2 × 2 matrix whose elements are the arbitrary NC parameters θ_{ı¯ȷ¯}.
Let us restrict to the case in which all the scale and NC parameters of the Poisson brackets of Eq. (16) are integrally transferred to the Lagrangian of Eq. (1). To guarantee that this happens, we may verify that det(f̃)=[g1g2−det(Θ)]{2}. Then, ensuring that det(Θ) ≠ g_{1}g_{2}, we can proceed working with f̃{−1}, with elements f̃{αβ}, and readily provide through Eq. (4) all the scale and NC parameters for ã{α}(ξ̃) on the first term of the Lagrangian given in Eq. (1). For n-dimensional configuration space, the general deformed symplectic 2n × 2n matrix f̃ will be embrace 2n(n − 1) NC and n scale parameters. The generalization to higher configuration space is straightforward, and it may be obtained from the results presented in the Appendix.
After this, one may follow the suggestion read in the Faddeev and Jackiw article [25] and find a transformation matrix to change from the noncommutative basis to the commutative basis and then express the henceforth restricted Lagrangian of Eq. (1) in terms of the latter basis where the direct Poisson brackets are the canonical ones and the crossed Poisson brackets vanish. So, we can realize that an expression containing the transformation matrix can be readily obtained with the substitution F=ξ̃{α} and G=ξ̃{β} in Eq. (14),
The transformation matrix will be represented by R such that
Then, taking into account Eqs. (13) and (16), we can express Eq. (20) in matrix form as
In order to get the matrix R from the previous equation, first it is necessary to ensure that R is invertible: It follows from Eq. (22) that [det(R)]{2}=det(f̃). Thus, to get R invertible, we must request the same condition which was provided before for that f̃ were invertible. After that, we can isolate f by moving R and R^{T} to the other side of Eq. (22) and then calculate the inverse of the resulting expression, which can be read as
The matrix product obtained by juxtaposing the expressions given in Eqs. (22) and (23) in a way that its right side given by f̃f^{−1} is read as
The previous equation can be worked to keep R^{T}R^{T} isolated, and after transposition, it follows that
At this point, considering the ansatzf̃f^{−1}=RR and inputting the right-hand side of this expression in the middle of the term between parentheses of Eq. (25), we get as output the same expression, RR=f̃f^{−1}. It is like if you asked someone: Is that? and then he answered: Yes that is. It follows that
So, according to Eq. (23), the matrix R^{−1}=ff̃{−1} effects the “symplecticzation” [25] of a full antisymmetric nonconstant f̃ matrix into the standard form f given in Eq. (7).
C. Noncommutativity transformations
From Eqs. (21) and (26), one takes the NC transformations for the differential of the phase-space coordinate (contravariant) and for the derivative operator (covariant), respectively, as
Equation (23) in components is expressed as
Substitution of Eqs. (4) and (6) in Eq. (29) settles that the derivative of the FJ coefficient has the following NC transformation:
Considering Eqs. (27) and (30), results from the differential identity dã{α}=(∂̃{β}ã{α})dξ̃{β} where da_{α} behaves under NC transformation as a covariant vector
D. General symplectic matrix case
Apart an additive exact differential inexpressive in the action of any Lagrangian, one arrives at
After employing the covariant vector transformation given in Eq. (31), we get
Disregarding again an additive exact differential, one can read
The first term on the right-hand side of the previous equation breaks the NC invariance of the FJ one-form. Thus the NC Lagrangian given in Eq. (1) can be read as
Finally, from Eq. (9), we get
whose first term, disregarding a total derivative, can be written in the usual p_{i}q̇{i} way and ξ̃=∫Rdξ. The extra term,
can disappear when some choices for the NC algebra among the variables are considered. From this relation, a suitable change of basis ξ^{α}→ξ̃{α} (commutative basis → noncommutative basis) can preserve, break, or restore a symmetry of the system, now without the necessity to extend the phase-space with the introduction of the Wess-Zumino fields.
E. Constant symplectic matrix case
In a very special case where R^{−1}αβ in Eq. (31) do not depend on the phase-space coordinate, we get after an integration that the NC transformation for the FJ coefficient will be given by
which is a covariant transformation. From the differential relation given in Eq. (27), we get a linear NC transformation for the phase-space velocity
which is a contravariant transformation. So, with Eqs. (38) and (39), we get the following NC invariant:
which corresponds to the NC invariance of the first term of the Lagrangian from Eq. (1). Using Eq. (9), and considering that H(ξ̃)=H(Rξ)=H̃(ξ), it can be read as
The equation of motion from the Lagrangian given in the previous equation is expressed by
whose components are Hamilton’s equations of motion, that now carry the NC parameters. The Lagrangian given in Eq. (41) can be directly expressed in the configuration space, disregarding a total derivative term, as
So, in this simplest case, with the change of the system prescription from the noncommutative basis to the commutative basis, one will find that all the NC-ingredients were transferred to the Hamiltonian and they could be interpreted as being an external (unknown) potential, a background field, a Lorentz symmetry breaking mechanism, or even a mass generation mechanism.
III. REPRESENTATION FOR TWO-DIMENSIONAL SPACE WITH 4 × 4 MATRICES
Consider a two-dimensional space, whose configuration coordinates q_{i} and their conjugated momenta p_{i} are arranged in the four-component phase-space coordinate as ξ^{α} = (q_{1}, p_{1}, q_{2}, p_{2}). One can express the symplectic matrix in the noncommutative basis through blocks as
where g_{1}, g_{2} are scale parameters; the 2 × 2 antisymmetric matrix ε has as elements the Levi-Civita two-dimensional symbol with ε_{12} = 1; and the 2 × 2 matrix
has as elements the NC parameters identified as the Poisson brackets. One may proceed swapping the second and third rows as well as the columns of f̃ in Eq. (44) corresponding to the phase-space coordinate in the conventional order, ξ^{α} = (q_{1}, q_{2}, p_{1}, p_{2}). Then, by means of a couple of new 2 × 2 matrices containing two parameters, each one,
and the remaining NC parameters, the symplectic matrix and its inverse in the noncommutative basis can be read as
where b^{2} = det(Θ). The matrix that perform transformations from the commutative to noncommutative basis, R, defined in Eq. (26), and its inverse will be given by
where D_{s} is the auxiliary diagonal 2 × 2 matrix
with
Then, it follows some identities that can be useful for calculations,
IV. APPLICATIONS
In this section, the NC mapping will be applied in order to introduce NC and scale parameters into a general model. This will be done in order to illustrate and shed some light on the question about the role played by the NC parameter into the model. It is important to notice that for any potential, written in terms of inverse power of |x→|, the NC induction approach could lead this potential to a very complex form, which obstructs the straightforward calculation of the equation of motion and the implementation of any quantization process. However, the NC symplectic induction formalism and NC map give an alternative way to introduce the NC algebra into the model, even that the potential presents the inverse power of |x→|.
A. A particle in a general potential
As the first example, we will consider a two-dimensional system where a particle, with mass m, suffers the action of a general potential V(q). This particle has its dynamic governed by the following Lagrangian density:
In agreement with the NC symplectic induction formalism, this Lagrangian should be written in a first-order form as in Eq. (10), then
where H=pi22m+V(q) is the Hamiltonian or, in the symplectic language, the symplectic potential. Now, we are ready to introduce the NC algebra into the model. To this end, we will propose the following NC brackets among the variables:
Note that θ has canonical dimensions of (length)^{2}, and, consequently, it introduces an ultra-violet scale to the problem if it is taken to be small. The transformation of phase-space coordinates, the commutative to the noncommutative one is implemented by
Considering the results given in Sec. III, we can follow the recipe given in Eq. (49) and build the matrix R taking D_{s} = 1, Σ = 0, {q̃{1},q̃{2}}=θ, and {p̃{1},p̃{2}}=0. Then, using Eq. (61), we get the transformations that lead us to the NC Lagrangian, which in the shape of Eq. (43); it is given by
This is the same result obtained when the *-product is implemented by Mezincescu [36]. If the Coulomb potential is chosen, we can reproduce the result obtained by Chaichian et_al [45]
After that, we will explore another possibility. To this end, the following NC brackets among the variables will be proposed:
Now, the NC parameter (θ) has canonical dimensions of (mass)^{2}, and, consequently, it introduces an infra-red scale if it is taken to be small. To reflect the NC brackets given in Eq. (63), we must set up in Eq. (49): D_{s} = 1, Σ = 0, {q̃{1},q̃{2}}=0, and {p̃{1},p̃{2}}=θ. Thus, repeating the receipt used before, the NC first-order Lagrangian is obtained as
where the NC Hamiltonian is
From the Euler-Lagrange equation of motion for the canonical momenta, we get
Introducing these canonical momenta into the NC first-order Lagrangian given in Eq. (64), we get
Therefore, distinct choices for the NC algebra among the brackets render distinct dynamic systems.
B. Charged harmonic oscillator
Assuming a system with the potential as being the two-dimensional harmonic oscillator, namely,
where ω is the frequency, the NC first-order Lagrangian given in Eq. (67) renders
with
Writing the Lagrangian above in a first-order form, namely,
the correspondent Hamiltonian is identified as being
or
since the relation given in Eq. (70) was used.
From the investigation done by Banerjee and Ghosh [46], the Hamiltonian of a charged harmonic oscillator in an axially symmetric magnetic field is
Comparing the Hamiltonian above with the one given in Eq. (73), we obtain the following identity:
Therefore, the NC version of the two-dimensional harmonic oscillator represents an electron in a very simple Bohr model of the hydrogen atom, where there is a background magnetic field. Due to this, the motion of the electron can be split into components parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field. In this setup, the NC parameter or the background magnetic field splits the original quantum level into three-levels, where one of the frequencies remains unchanged and the other two frequencies changed to
The Hamiltonian above has a structure very similar to the model of a charged particle in a specified electromagnetic field discussed in these papers [47,48], where the eigenstates are constructed of the invariant operator. In accordance with Banerjee and Ghosh [46], the standard Zeeman level is given by
where B is a constant. With this approach, the presence of NC parameter into the system might be interpreted as being the origin of charge property of the particle and the interaction of this one with a background magnetic field. As expected, this changes the energy spectrum of the model, which was shown above.
C. Two independent harmonic oscillators
In this section, we will explore new features from the NC approach discussed here. In order to do this, we will consider a system with two particles where each one presents mass m. This system has its dynamics governed by the following Lagrangian density:
The potential above is, for a while, a general interactive potential. The correspondent Hamiltonian is
At this point, we started with the Lagrangian density given in Eq. (78) and proposed different NC brackets among the variables, namely,
In this case, we must set up in Eq. (49): D_{s} = 1, Σ = 0, {q̃{1},q̃{2}}=0, and {p̃{1},p̃{2}}=δ_{ab}⋅(−1){δa1}⋅θ to get the transformations that lead us to the NC Lagrangian
where the NC Hamiltonian is
The canonical momenta can be computed from Eq. (81),
Introducing the canonical momenta given above into the first-order Lagrangian given in Eq. (81), we get
Assuming that this model is a pair of an unitary charges of opposite sign in a magnetic field, where the NC parameter is interpreted as being the magnetic field, i.e., θ = B, and doing an educated guess for the potential,
the Lagrangian density given in (84) renders
which is the result discussed by Bigatti and Susskind [49] in Sec. I.A of this referred paper.
D. Charge and mass rescaling
The existence of the scale parameters on the NC scenario can have consequences on the mass values and charge values after the NC mapping. We verify these consequences on the simple Coulomb model for the hydrogen atom, turning on only the scales parameters in the NC algebra. To this end, we will propose the following NC brackets among the variables:
where g is the scale parameter. The Coulomb model is described by the following Hamiltonian
The symplectic matrices on the commutative and noncommutative basis for the phase-space coordinate in the conventional order (q_{i}, p_{i}) are, respectively, given by
The NC transformation matrix can be obtained from the symplectic matrices as
Finally, calculating the NC phase-space coordinates on the commutative basis through the matrix R, we obtain from Eq. (88) the NC Hamiltonian in the commutative framework with the rescaling of the mass and the charge,
where
Thus, at the noncommutative scenario where, for instance, there are non-degenerescence in the mass spectrum, and, consequently, we can adjust conveniently the values for the scale parameter to account for the diversity of the mass spectrum in the commutative scenario. Further, we can interpret the mass degenerescence present in Eq. (92) in analogy with the mass spectrum arbitrariness obtained when the canonical quantization procedure is applied, which arises when the quantum operator is ordered.
V. CONCLUSION
In this article, Bopp’s shifts were generalized and systematized in the symplectic framework. Indeed, Bopp’s shifts were implemented by the transformation that map the commutative and NC phase-space coordinates. Consequently, it reduces the NC deformed symplectic matrix to its canonical representation, as suggested by Faddeev and Jackiw [25]. Now, it is possible to introduce 2n(n − 1) NC and n scale parameters into a n-dimensional system in a wide, practical, and easy way to set up different NC algebra. Consequently, it allows us to explore the corresponding different contributions related to the noncommutativity. This result drives us to conclude that the *-product was also generalized since the usual ⋆-product induces simple Bopp’s shifts [37,38]: the NC mapping reproduces the results obtained when the ⋆-product is implemented without the necessity to constrain the NC parameters to be small (≪1). Therefore, ultra-violet and infra-red divergence do not, necessarily, appear into the model. Furthermore, it was possible to investigate how gauge symmetry behavior can be related to the change of the basis ξ^{α}→ξ̃{α} (commutative basis → noncommutative basis), i.e., the NC algebra among the variables induced into the system can preserve or break the previous gauge symmetry of the system. At this point, it is important to observe that it is possible to choose a NC algebra among the variables which induces a gauge symmetry into the system, i.e., now it is possible to transform systems with second-class constraints in first-class ones—gauge theories [9]—without the necessity to extend the phase-space with the introduction of the auxiliary fields, as elegantly proposed by Batalin, Fradkin, Fradkina, and Tyutin [50–53] and discussed in distinct framework [29,54,55]. In order to illustrate and put our procedure in a correct perspective with others studies present in the literature, we apply the NC mapping in some very simple models: the one- and two-dimensional harmonic oscillators. From this application, some previous results presented in the literature were reproduced and it was also possible to show that distinct choices for the NC algebra among the symplectic variables generates distinct, in a dynamically point of view, NC systems that could be interpreted, at least in the lower energy level, as being quantum versions of the correspondent commutative model. This was shown when it was considered to study the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator, where the NC parameters in these systems were responsible to split the quantum states of the hydrogen atom, as shown by Banerjee and Ghosh [46]. Further, when the two-dimensional harmonic oscillator was considered, it was possible to obtain the result obtained by Bigatti and Susskind [49] and, also, it was discussed and proposed an alternative interpretation for the scale parameters on the NC scenario: the mass and charge values depend on scale parameters, i.e., an arbitrariness in the mass spectrum arises, which can explain the quantum features that arise when the NC system is mapped into its respective commutative one. This can be seen, in analogy with the quantum canonical procedure, as being the mass spectrum arbitrariness due to the operator ordering ambiguity problem.
APPENDIX: REPRESENTATIONS FOR THE SYMPLECTIC AND RELATED MATRICES
For a three-dimensional space whose configuration coordinates q_{i} and their conjugated momenta p_{i} are arranged in the six-component phase-space coordinate as
In order to embrace 12 (twelve) NC parameters in a compact manner, we will consider the three 2 × 2 matrices, Θ_{12}, Θ_{13}, and Θ_{23}, where each one embraces four independent NC parameters. Their respective determinants will be represented as bij2, corresponding to Θ_{ij}. One will present only the 6 × 6 symplectic matrix f̃ and its inverse in the noncommutative basis
Let us consider the symbol
One will highlight that the Pfaffian of the symplectic 6 × 6 matrix on the noncommutative basis can be read as pf(f̃)=g_{1}g_{2}g_{3}−b^{2}. Then, the inverse is given by
Thus, the general condition for f̃ being inverse is that its Pfaffian does not vanish, or equivalently, b^{2} ≠ g_{1}g_{2}g_{3}; on the contrary, the symplectic matrix is singular, and, consequently, the system presents a symmetry. It follows some identities,
