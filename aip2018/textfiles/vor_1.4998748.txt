Oxygen vibrational modes in ZnS_{1−x}O_{x} alloys
ZnS_{1−x}O_{x} alloy films were studied via resonant Raman spectroscopy. Films with a low oxygen content exhibit ZnS longitudinal optical modes and additional modes attributed to O local vibrational modes (LVMs). The frequencies of these modes are explained by a simple mass-defect model. As the O content increases, pairs and larger clusters form, causing the O mode to transition from an LVM to a delocalized phonon. The composition dependence of the modes shows agreement with the modified random element isodisplacement model. Low-temperature measurements show that the O-related mode is composed of multiple features, attributed to zincblende and wurtzite structural regions.
I. INTRODUCTION
Oxide-chalcogenide alloy zinc oxysulfide (ZnS_{1−x}O_{x}) is a promising material for optoelectronic applications. This alloy system presents a number of interesting properties. In particular, the predicted large bandgap bowing may enable engineering of the bandgap from the UV to the blue/green region of the electromagnetic spectrum despite the bandgaps of both endmembers being in the UV [1–4]. ZnS_{1−x}O_{x} is composed of relatively inexpensive, earth-abundant elements. In addition to deliberate alloying, oxygen is also a common contaminant in ZnS crystals [5].
First-principles calculations [3] have shown that by adding O to ZnS, the conduction band shifts to lower energies, while the valence band remains at a nearly fixed energy up to x ∼ 0.5. Above x ∼ 0.5, the valence band moves to lower energies, while the conduction band remains largely fixed. Thus, a deep acceptor in ZnO may be a shallow acceptor in ZnS_{1−x}O_{x} for the appropriate alloy composition. Consequently, by raising the valence band, bandgap bowing may lead to successful p-type doping of ZnO-compatible materials. In addition, the ZnS_{1−x}O_{x} alloy has attracted attention as a possible non-toxic alternative to CdS buffer layers in chalcopyrite based solar cells [6,7]. In this work, we report composition-dependent resonant Raman scattering measurements of ZnS_{1−x}O_{x} films grown by reactive radio frequency (rf) magnetron sputtering.
Because O is lighter than S, substitutional O impurities are expected to have a local vibrational mode (LVM), an oscillation that is localized in frequency and real space [8]. An LVM gives rise to sharp peaks in IR and Raman spectra and involves localized motion of the impurity atom and a only few neighbors. As the O concentration increases into the alloy regime, the vibration transitions from an LVM to an extended, phonon-like excitation. This is known as the “two mode” behavior [9]. Other mixed crystal systems known to display a two mode behavior include Si_{1−x}Ge_{x} [10], GaP_{1−x}As_{x} [11], and CdS_{1−x}Se_{x} [12]. The shift of the vibrational frequencies with the composition is described by the modified random element isodisplacement (MREI) model [13]. The MREI model has been successfully applied to a large variety of mixed crystals including Mg_{x}Zn_{1−x}O [14], Mo_{1−x}W_{x}S_{2} [15], K_{1−x}Rb_{x}I [16], and Ga_{x}Al_{1−x}N [17].
II. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS
The films grown in this work were sputtered using a ZnS ceramic target (99.99%), a power density of 2.5–3.9 W/cm^{2}, and an rf frequency of 13.56 MHz. Ultra-high purity Ar and O_{2} were the working and reactive gases, respectively, and were controlled using MKS p4B mass flow controllers. The chamber was evacuated to a base pressure of <5 × 10^{−6 }Torr using a turbomolecular pump. The c-plane sapphire substrates were held at 150–200 °C using a custom PID type controller. Resonant Raman measurements were collected using a Horiba T64000 micro Raman/photoluminescence system with a CCD detector and 325 nm excitation. Low temperature measurements were performed using an Instec HCS621V cold stage customized for UV compatibility.
Figure 1 presents the representative X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of the films. The lowest composition film agrees with literature data for ZnS, as well as an XRD spectrum of commercial ZnS powder (not shown). The shift in the peak position shows that alloying occurs in the films, in agreement with the Raman results presented here. The XRD peaks of wurtzite ZnS (002) and zincblende ZnS (111) closely overlap [4], and the only peak observed is in this region, indicating that the films are oriented. The longitudinal optical (LO) modes of both phases also coincide, thus leaving phase identification somewhat ambiguous. The comparatively low growth temperature and modeling results suggest that the films are in the zincblende structure. However, low temperature resonant Raman scattering results presented in Sec. III D suggest that the films may have a small wurtzite component. No ZnO phases were detected in XRD or Raman measurements.
The composition of the films (S/Zn ratio) was determined by Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). RBS measurements were carried out using a 3.04 MeV He^{2+} beam at a backscattering angle of 165°. RBS data were analyzed using the SIMNRA software [18]. For consistency, the presented spectra are labeled using compositions obtained by RBS. The sputtered films showed O concentrations of several percent, even when no oxygen was deliberately introduced. The lowest composition film, which was grown with a new ZnS target, showed a concentration of x < 0.01. We refer to this low-O content film as “ZnS.” Samples grown with a high O_{2} flow (1% of the total) resulted in films with poor-quality XRD and Raman spectra, perhaps due to phase separation. From the difference between the RBS and EDS results (Table I), we estimated the uncertainty in S/Zn to be ±0.03.
III. RESULTS
A. Room temperature Raman spectroscopy
Figure 2 shows the representative resonant Raman spectra of ZnS and ZnS_{0.98}O_{0.02} films at room temperature, with bulk single-crystal ZnS (Fairfield Crystal Technology) for comparison. The figure shows the harmonic LO modes of ZnS and a satellite mode near 412 and 416 cm^{−1}, respectively. An additional set of satellite modes are observed 63–68 cm^{−1} above the higher order LO modes. The satellite modes are separated by the 1LO mode frequency. The satellite peaks do not appear in the bulk ZnS sample, indicating that they are not intrinsic features. Furthermore, while two-phonon modes may be present near 400 cm^{−1}, they cannot account for the higher frequency satellite bands near 761 and 1110 cm^{−1}. As discussed in Sec. III B, the 412 cm^{−1} peak is attributed to an O-related mode.
To understand the origin of the satellite bands at 761 and 1110 cm^{−1}, consider that the intensity of resonant Raman scattering is proportional to [19]
where E_{i,j} are the electronic states and ω_{l} and ω_{s} are the frequencies of the laser and scattered photons, respectively. The satellite bands are observed to follow O-mode + nLO behavior (n =0, 1, 2). If the incoming photon ω_{l} scatters and excites the O-related mode, this scattered photon may still be in resonance with an electronic transition E_{i} [20]. For dilute O concentrations, the density of states for the LO mode is considerably larger than that for the O-related mode. Consequently, the photon will likely excite an LO mode. By energy conservation, this scattered photon will have an energy ℏω_{s}_{2} = ℏω_{l} – ℏω_{O-mode} – ℏω_{LO.} In other words, the observation of phonon replicas may be explained in terms of outgoing resonant behavior, where the scattered photon is itself in resonance with an electronic transition [19,21].
B. Mass defect models
To understand the origin of the satellite bands, a mass-defect model was constructed. The ZnS crystal was modeled using a linear chain of 256 atoms with periodic boundary conditions [22]. The force constant was adjusted to reproduce the observed LO mode frequency of ZnS. Thereafter, a single O was substituted onto an S site, and the vibrational frequency was calculated. The model gives the LVM frequency of substitutional O in ZnS as 433 cm^{−1}, close to the observed satellite peak value of 412 cm^{−1} (Fig. 2). Since the mass defect model does not account for anharmonicity or changes in the force constants, the ∼20 cm^{−1} discrepancy between the theory and experiment is reasonable. This model suggests that the 412 cm^{−1} band should be identified as a vibrational mode of O substituting the S sites in ZnS_{1−x}O_{x}. Using a similar model for ZnO, we estimate the gap mode frequency of S substituting on an O site as 323 cm^{−1}.
To investigate the O-related mode further, the ZnS crystal was simulated by a 216-atom three-dimensional cubic cell with periodic boundary conditions. Nearest neighbors interacted via stretching and bending force constants [23]. These two force constants were adjusted to simulate the ZnS phonon dispersion determined from neutron scattering experiments [24]. As shown in Fig. 3, this model qualitatively reproduces the phonon frequency bands. An isolated O mass defect results in a LVM frequency of 436 cm^{−1}. As more O atoms are added randomly, pairs of next-nearest neighbors, and larger clusters, begin to form. This clustering results in a broadening of the vibrational band (Fig. 3), in agreement with the experiment. The mass-defect model does not, however, account for the increase in the LO frequency due to the electronegativity of the O atoms. This effect is treated by the MREI model, which is discussed next.
C. Composition dependence
Figure 4 presents the resonant Raman spectra of ZnS_{1−x}O_{x} films for various compositions. The O-related mode is observed to shift toward higher energy with an increased O content of the films. The ZnS LO mode displays a shift to lower frequencies and a decrease in intensity. The higher order ZnS LO and O-mode + nLO combination modes are rapidly suppressed with the increasing O content.
To understand the composition dependent behavior of the modes, we used the MREI model [13], which gives a basic criterion for predicting the phonon behavior of alloy crystals. Consider an alloy AB_{x}C_{1−x} with masses m_{A}, m_{B}, and m_{C}, respectively, where m_{B} < m_{C}. Letting μ_{AC} be the reduced mass of elements A and C, then if
the alloy will follow a “two mode” behavior; otherwise, the alloy will display “one mode” behavior. If we let A = Zn, B = O, and C = S, then we find that ZnS_{1−x}O_{x} follows a two mode behavior. Upon adding a small quantity of O to ZnS, an O related LVM forms. With the increasing O content, the LVM becomes delocalized and shifts in frequency until it reaches the LO mode of ZnO. In addition, the O mode splits into LO and TO modes, which shift toward their ZnO values with the increased O content.
The MREI model requires knowledge of the high frequency dielectric constant ε_{∞} for both end members. While the value of ε_{∞} is known for ZnS [25], there are no experimental reports for zincblende ZnO. The value has been calculated theoretically [26,27], but the density functional approach used underestimates the bandgap and consequently overestimates ε_{∞} [27]. For the purpose of model calculations, the measured values of ε_{∞} for wurtzite ZnO were compared to the theoretical values and found to be overestimated by about 30% [27]. This overestimation was accounted for in the value of ε_{∞} used for zincblende ZnO.
Table II presents the parameters used for the MREI model and the relevant calculated parameters. The estimated value for ω_{gap} is reasonable as it falls in the predicted frequency gap for zincblende ZnO [26]. The force constants F and the interaction parameter θ were obtained by solving the following system of equations [13]:
The oscillator strength 4πρ_{AB} was obtained using
with the equivalent expression for 4πρ_{AC}.
Figure 5 presents the phonon mode behavior obtained from the MREI model for zincblende ZnS_{1−x}O_{x}. The model reproduces the observed slight decrease in the ZnS LO mode and the shift in the O-related mode. Polynomials describing the phonon frequencies can be found in the supplementary material. The data points presented in Fig. 5 show the composition for each sample as measured by RBS and EDS. No systematic differences between the measurement techniques were observed (Table I).
Our results are different from those reported by Guc et_al, who found that the O-related mode shifts linearly with the oxygen content [28] with an estimated frequency of 403 cm^{−1} at the dilute limit. One difference is that Guc et_al fit data over the entire composition range, which encompassed wurtzite and zincblende phases. Second, XPS is a surface sensitive measurement and may overestimate the bulk oxygen composition due to sulfur-poor surfaces.
D. Low temperature Raman spectroscopy
Low temperature Raman measurements were performed to further investigate the nature of the O-related mode. Figure 6 presents a representative Raman spectrum at 80 K. The vibrational band is found to be composed of two distinct modes at 405 and 416 cm^{−1} (406 and 420 cm^{−1}) for ZnS (ZnS_{0.98}O_{0.02}). At room temperature, thermal broadening obscures these features. Alloy broadening at high O compositions also washes out the features. The mode at 405 cm^{−1} is of considerably lower energy than would be expected for the TO component (Fig. 5), and no reasonable model parameters are able to reproduce this frequency while still fitting the other data.
One possibility is that the mode at 405 cm^{−1} indicates the presence of a wurtzite component. Such detection is possible by resonant Raman scattering [29–31]. As can be seen from Eq. (1), if a material has regions with differing bandgaps and the laser excitation is sufficient near these electronic transitions, resonant Raman scattering may be observed from these regions, even if the quantity of the material is quite small. The bandgap of zincblende ZnS is reported to be 3.7 eV (Refs [25] and  [32]), while that of wurtzite ZnS is reported slightly higher at 3.8–3.9 eV (Refs [32] and  [33]), and the laser excitation is 3.81 eV. The laser excitation is very close to resonance with both ZnS polytypes, and using Eq. (1), both phases could be detectable simultaneously.
ZnS is known to exhibit polytypism similar to that of SiC with numerous degrees of hexagonality and the transition between polytypes occurring at stacking faults [34,35]. Furthermore, studies of nanocrystalline ZnS_{1−x}O_{x} have shown transitions between the zincblende and wurtzite structures [36], suggesting that both phases may coexist in the alloys to some degree. Thus, the 405 cm^{−1} mode may be attributable to O in a wurtzite type structure. Alternatively, this mode could arise from an O atom located at a stacking fault.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
ZnS_{1−x}O_{x} films were grown by reactive rf magnetron sputtering and studied via resonant Raman spectroscopy. Films with a low O content were found to exhibit ZnS LO modes and additional modes attributed to an O-related mode and O-mode + nLO combination modes. The assignment of the modes was supported by mass-defect models. The ZnS_{1−x}O_{x} alloy was modeled using the MREI model, and it is found that ZnS_{1−x}O_{x} follows a two mode behavior, in agreement with the experiment. The phonon frequencies predicted by the MREI model agree with experimental data. Low temperature resonant Raman measurements showed that the O-related mode is composed of two features, which were attributed to zincblende and wurtzite type crystalline regions.
