Defect induced room temperature ferromagnetism in single crystal, poly-crystal, and nanorod ZnO: A comparative study
A comparative study has been made for the defect induced room temperature ferromagnetism of single crystal, poly-crystal, and nanorod zinc oxide (ZnO), based on the magnetic properties and electronic properties by means of X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy (XANES), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), valence band photoemission spectroscopy (VB-PES), and SQUID-type magnetometry. Magnetic measurement demonstrates the defect-induced ferromagnetic nature at room temperature in different ZnO films and a strong correlation between their electronic properties and magnetic responses. The higher ferromagnetic behaviour in polycrystalline ZnO is attributed to the increasing number of surface defects and native defect sites (oxygen vacancies and zinc interstitials) present in ZnO. XANES studies reveal that the number of unoccupied p states in polycrystalline ZnO is higher than single crystal ZnO as well as nanorod ZnO. The more amount of oxygen vacancy causes the highest intensity the O 1 s peak to appear in the XANES spectra of polycrystalline ZnO. In polycrystalline ZnO, the binding energy of the Zn 2p_{3/2} core level peak shifted to lower energy that further confirms the increase of the valence band maximum (VBM) position. The VBM of single crystal, poly-crystal, and nanorod-ZnO is 3.64 eV, 3.99 eV, and 3.71 eV, respectively, obtained from UPS (He-I) measurements. VB-PES studies confirm that the number of electrons in the valence band of O 2p - Zn 4sp hybridized states of poly-crystal ZnO is higher than single crystal and nanorod-ZnO.
I. INTRODUCTION
ZnO is one of the most promising II–VI semiconductors with a wide direct bandgap of 3.3 eV at room temperature [1]. Due to this large bandgap, ZnO has the ability to sustain large electric fields, higher breakdown voltages, lower electronic noise, and high-temperature and high-power operation [2]. Oxygen vacancies and/or zinc interstitials in ZnO result in n-type native doping [2]. It has excellent optical, chemical, and electrical properties while being nontoxic and inexpensive. ZnO has several properties including good transparency, high electron mobility, and strong room-temperature luminescence. Due to its transparent nature, it has been used in different device applications such as transparent thin film transistors [3–6], photovoltaics [7–10], lighting [11–13] bulk acoustic wave devices [14–16], and photonic devices in the ultraviolet range [17–19]. Compared to gallium nitride (GaN), which has similar bandgap (∼3.4 eV at room temperature), ZnO has a larger exciton binding energy (BE) (∼60 meV, 2.4 times of room-temperature thermal energy, k_{B}T = 25 meV) which paves the way for an intense near-band-edge excitonic emission [19]. ZnO has been also considered as a diluted magnetic semiconductor (DMS) for spintronic application [20,21] due to its theoretically predicted and experimentally observed room temperature ferromagnetism (RT-FM) [22]. In the recent era, the d^{0} magnetism in ZnO has been considered to be one of the most interesting and challenging phenomena which may provide a new window for investigating and understanding the origin of nanomagnetism [23,24]. The intrinsic defects and/or vacancies in ZnO nanostructures and the point defects at the grain boundary region in polycrystalline ZnO are considered to be one of the reasons of d^{0} magnetism of different ZnO films with different crystal structures [25,26]. However, the role of extrinsic (magnetic atom etc.) and/or intrinsic defects in RT-FM of ZnO is not yet clearly understood, and still the mechanism behind remains controversial. Different methods have been reported to synthesise amorphous, polycrystalline and single crystalline ZnO nanomaterials, especially in the form of nanorods. Moreover, ZnO has been also synthesized as nanoparticles, nanowires, nanorod, needle-like structures, and many other forms [27]. However, the resulting structures are generally amorphous and they require high-temperature treatment to induce crystallinity. ZnO crystallizes mainly in two forms– hexagonal wurtzite and cubic zinc-blende, among which the hexagonal wurtzite structure is the most stable at the ambient condition. Further, the single crystal ZnO is superior to polycrystalline ZnO due to the decreasing number of grain boundaries that helps a direct and quick charge carrier transport by decreasing the carrier path length, which in turn decreases the recombination losses [27].
The objective of this study is to find out the origin of defect induced d^{0} magnetism at room temperature in different ZnO crystal structures without any magnetic ion dopants with the help of their electronic and bonding properties. To broaden our approach and to profit from various morphologies amenable to ZnO, we have studied a comparison among the single crystal, polycrystalline, and nanorod ZnO films. For a meaningful comparison among the single crystal, polycrystalline, and nanorod ZnO films, different types of x-ray-based spectroscopic and microscopic techniques were used to probe the defects and/or vacancies for a comparative study in terms of their chemical states, electronic structures, and magnetic moments, which are closely related to the origin of d^{0} magnetism in ZnO nanostructure materials. These studies have shown a strong correlation between the electronic and magnetic properties of three different ZnO crystal structures that are identified for different device based applications.
II. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
ZnO single crystals were purchased from Biotain Crystal Co., Ltd. Polycrystalline and nanorod-ZnO thin films were synthesized using a wet chemical method. The details of the synthesis process of different ZnO films could be available elsewhere [28,29]. The microstructures of these films were studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD). The magnetic properties of these films were compared using a SQUID-type magnetometer. The electronic and bonding structure was studied using Raman spectroscopy, X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy (XANES), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), and valence band photoemission spectroscopy (VB-PES). The Zn L_{3}‐edge XANES and O K-edge XANES and VB-PES (hν = 385 eV) measurements of these films were performed at the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Centre (NSRRC), Hsinchu, Taiwan. The Zn L_{3}‐edge and O K-edge spectra were obtained in the surface-sensitive electron-yield mode. The resolution was set to 0.2 eV and 0.1 eV at a photon energy of 1020 and 530 eV for the Zn L_{3}‐edge and O K-edge XANES measurements, respectively. The core-level XPS spectra were recorded on a KRATOS–SUPRA spectrometer at the UNISA (Florida Science Campus), South Africa using monochromatic Al K_{α} radiation with excitation energy hν = 1486.6 eV having a base pressure of 1.2 × 10^{−8 }Torr. The UPS spectra were also recorded using the KRATOS – SUPRA spectrometer using a He lamp (He-I) with excitation energy hν = 21.2 eV and the base pressure was ∼1.2 × 10^{−9 }Torr. Raman spectra were measured using HORIBA scientific XploRA at 532 nm (∼2.41 eV) LASER light excitation energy. The LASER power and the beam spot area were 5 mW and 3 μm^{2}, respectively. Special care was taken in order to rule out possible sample annealing during measurements. All the measurements were performed at room temperature.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The XRD patterns of single crystal, poly-crystal, and nanorod-ZnO are shown in Figs. 1(a)–1(c), respectively. The characteristic peak corresponding to the reflection from the (002) plane in the single crystal ZnO indicates a single crystalline wurtzite phase with preferred c-axis orientation [30]. Various diffraction peaks corresponding to the reflection from (002), (101), and (102) planes were observed in polycrystalline ZnO films in Fig. 1(b) and nanorod ZnO in Fig. 1(c), which indicate its polycrystalline wurtzite phase. However, the relative intensity of the (002) diffraction plane was higher than (101) and (102) planes in poly-crystal and nanorod ZnO films. Shifting of the diffraction peak from the (002) plane at higher angles in polycrystalline ZnO films (2θ ∼ 34.7°) as well as nanorod ZnO film (2θ ∼ 34.7°) with respect to single crystal ZnO (2θ ∼ 34.4°) is related to change in the stress caused by imperfections within the ZnO lattice, such as vacancies, interstitials, and stacking faults [31,32]. It is noted that the nanorod-ZnO is itself a polycrystal and the main difference with the single crystal ZnO is the microstructural shape; whereas polycrystal ZnO is not nanorod in shape but in spherical nanoparticles. The left part of Figs. 1(d)–1(f) compares the surface atomic ratio of individual Zn and O in single crystal, poly-crystal, and nanorod ZnO using XPS elemental micrographs image mapping, whereas the right part shows the average picture of the corresponding films. XPS element mapping visualized the atomic ratio of Zn and O on the surface of ZnO films. From the image, it is clear that the screen turns bluish in single crystal ZnO, which has a higher surface Zn ratio than poly-crystal ZnO. This also indicates a quite uniform distribution of Zn and O in all ZnO crystal systems. The atomic ratio of Zn to O was 53:47, 49:51, and 50:50 for single crystal, poly-crystal, and nanorod-ZnO, respectively, as shown in Table I.
Raman scattering is an effective tool to investigate the structure and defects in nanostructure materials. For hexagonal wurtzite ZnO, the non-polar phonon mode E_{2} has low- and high-frequency components [E_{2} (low) and E_{2} (high)], and the polar A_{1} and E_{1} modes split into longitudinal optical (LO) and transverse optical (TO) components [A_{1} (TO), A_{1} (LO), E_{1} (TO), and E_{1} (LO)] [33]. The high-frequency E_{2} mode and the low frequency E_{2} mode are associated with the vibration of oxygen atoms and Zn sub-lattice, respectively. Raman spectra measured at 532 nm (2.41 eV) LASER light excitation are shown in Figs. 1(g)–1(i) for single crystal, poly-crystal, and nanorod ZnO crystals, respectively. In Fig. 1(g), the Raman spectrum of single crystal ZnO shows two strong and sharp peaks at 100 cm^{−1} and 438.5 cm^{−1} corresponding to the E_{2} (low) and E_{2} (high) modes which are characteristic of the wurtzite crystal structure and a relatively weaker peak at 576 cm^{−1} corresponding to the A_{1} (LO) mode which is attributed to O or Zn vacancy or interstitial related defects present in ZnO crystals [32,34]. Another vibration mode at 332 cm^{−1} was also observed in Fig. 1(g) which is assigned to the second order [E_{2} (high)- E_{2} (low)] mode due to overtones or combination of first order modes [35]. In contrast to single crystal ZnO, the E_{2} (high) mode in poly-crystal [Fig. 1(h)] and in nanorod ZnO [Fig. 1(i)] is much weaker, indicating a large lattice disorder in the wurtzite structure. Moreover, the position of E_{2} (high) mode in nanorod ZnO (440 cm^{−1}) in Fig. 1(i) is shifted by 1.5 cm^{−1} compared to single crystal ZnO, and this causes a compressive stress in the nanorod ZnO, which could be attributed to more oxygen defects present in nanorod ZnO than single-crystal ZnO [36]. Unlikely, the A_{1} (LO) mode was not detectable in the Raman spectrum of poly-crystal ZnO films [Fig. 1(h)]. Cuscó et_al [37] assigned the vibration peak at 480 cm^{−1} in polycrystalline ZnO films to 2LA along M-K Brillouin zone lines, which is relative to the nanoparticle surface defects. The absence of the Raman peak in nanorod ZnO at 576 cm^{−1} suggests the low oxygen vacancy concentration and high quality ZnO nanorod films [38]. The peaks observed at 304 cm^{−1}, 521 cm^{−1}, and 620 cm^{−1} in the Raman spectrum of nanorod ZnO [Fig. 1(i)] are due to scattering from a silicon substrate.
A comparative study based on the magnetic properties of single crystal, poly-crystal, and nanorod ZnO have been carried out by magnetic property measurements using a SQUID-type magnetometer. Figure 2 shows the room-temperature M–H plot of single crystal, poly-crystal, and nanorod ZnO. It is clear that all the films are ferromagnetic at 300 K. The magnetic hysteresis plot clearly shows room temperature ferromagnetism nature with a saturation magnetization (M_{S}) of 1.1 × 10^{−5 }emu/gm, 3.5 × 10^{−5 }emu/gm, and 2.6 × 10^{−5 }emu/gm for single crystal, poly-crystal, and nanorod-ZnO, respectively, which are given in Table I. The highest magnetic moment was achieved in poly-crystal ZnO that was nearly ∼3.5 times higher than the single crystal ZnO. The higher ferromagnetic behaviour in poly-crystal ZnO is attributed to the increasing number of grain boundary surface defects and native defect sites (oxygen vacancies/zinc interstitials) present in ZnO [39]. A small coercive field (H_{C}) was also observed from the magnified view (−400 Oe to +400 Oe) of the hysteresis curve which is shown in the lower inset of Fig. 2. The H_{C} values were approximately ∼25 Oe, ∼134 Oe, and ∼38 Oe for single crystal, poly-crystal, and nanorod-ZnO films, respectively (see Table I). The remanent magnetization (M_{R}) values were 0.18 × 10^{−6 }emu/gm, 5.32 × 10^{−6 }emu/gm, and 1.91 × 10^{−6 }emu/gm for single crystal, poly-crystal, and nanorod ZnO, respectively. All the magnetic parameters obtained from M-H loops are listed in Table I. Thus, single crystal and nanorod ZnO are comparatively lower H_{C} as well as lower M_{R} compared to poly-crystal ZnO. The enhanced RT-FM observed in poly-crystal ZnO films may arise from the oxygen vacancies on grain boundary surface defects [39]. when an oxygen vacancy is created, a positive center is also formed on the grain boundary surface, which can capture the surrounding electrons. Once the electrons are captured, they are localized in their position. As the local electrons have magnetic moments, it makes these oxygen vacancies obtain magnetism [40]. The differences in the magnetic properties of different ZnO films are due to differences in native defects (oxygen vacancies/zinc interstitials), defects due to the grain boundary, density of states (DOS), and work function. On the other hand, the upper inset of Fig. 2 shows the variation of magnetization (M) versus temperature (T) of single crystal, poly-crystal, and nanorod ZnO, that represents a low-field magnetic susceptibility of the materials. One can find that the magnetization of all the ZnO films keeps almost constant at the temperature range from 30 K to 300 K that is thermally independent and suggests that the Curie temperature of the films is above 300 K [41]. A slight increase of the magnetization below 30 K was also observed in polycrystalline ZnO films which could be attributed to weak para-magnetism [42]. It is noted that the M vs. T of ZnO-SC returns to the lowest indication of the paramagnetic signal which agrees that it also has the lowest saturation magnetization. The M vs. T of ZnO-PC points to weak curie – like behaviour of captured, localized electron. In general, all ZnO crystals that are studied act as soft magnetic materials and could be used in electromagnetic applications.
To study the local electronic structure around Zn and O atoms of three different ZnO, we have recorded the XANES spectra at the Zn L_{3}‐edge and O K-edge. This technique is a powerful method to understand the local electronic structure of metal-oxide systems. In this technique, the photons are absorbed by the material and a transition of a core electron to an empty state above the Fermi level occurs. Figure 3(a) shows the Zn L_{3}‐edge XANES spectra of single crystal, poly-crystal, and nanorod ZnO films. The lower inset of Fig. 3(a) shows the Zn L_{3}‐edge of these ZnO films after the background subtraction using a best-fitted Gaussian curve indicated by the black empty circle line as shown in Fig. 3(a). The Zn L_{3}-edge absorption peaks arise due to the transition of the 2p core electron to the unoccupied 4d levels as final states. The Zn L_{3}-edge absorption spectra of the polycrystalline ZnO film are convoluted into four peaks assigned as A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}, and A_{4} at a photon energy of 1022.2 eV, 1024.8 eV, 1026.9 eV, and 1031.2 eV, respectively, which are shown in the upper inset of Fig. 3(a). A similar observation was found in single crystal and nanorod ZnO whose details are given in the supplementary material. This multi peak structure of Zn in Zn L_{3}‐edge XANES spectra, as well as the differences in absorption intensity in different ZnO, is a result of its crystal structure, which gives more convenient quantum symmetries for the excited electrons to occupy as the final state and to construct larger molecular orbitals via mixing of 3d - 4p levels [43]. The peak A_{1} which is in the pre-edge position provides the information about the disorder in the crystal structure formation and defect sites in the structure [43]. These structural disorder and surface defects in ZnO films are responsible for the RT-FM behaviour as observed and shown in Fig. 2. It is clear from Fig. 3(a) (also see in S1) that the peak A_{1} is more prominent in polycrystalline ZnO films, which indicates the presence of more inherent defect sites in it than single crystal or nanorod ZnO [43]. The peaks A_{2} and A_{3} are the main absorption peaks related to the transition of 2p electrons to the Zn 4p levels. The absorption intensity of these peaks can be correlated with the available unoccupied states over the Fermi level for the excited electrons [44,45]. The higher absorption intensity relates to the transition to unoccupied p states. The absorption intensity of the peaks A_{2} and A_{3} in polycrystalline ZnO films is higher than single crystal and nanorod ZnO; which means that the number of unoccupied p states in polycrystalline ZnO films is higher than single crystal ZnO as well as nanorod ZnO. The highest intensity in poly-crystal ZnO may refer to stronger coupling and overlap between the outer shell electrons of the neighbouring atoms and Zn sites [43]. The peak A_{4} occurs as a result of weaker d–d interaction between the source and neighbouring Zn 4d states.
In a metal oxide system, an oxygen atom is the most popular agent for investigation because of being sensitive to the local bonding and symmetry. The O K-edge XANES spectra of three representative films of ZnO single crystal, poly-crysta,l and nanorod are shown in Fig. 3(b). The lower inset of Fig. 3(b) shows the O K-edge near-edge features of all ZnO films after the background subtraction using a best-fitted Gaussian line indicated by the black empty circle line as shown in Fig. 3(b). According to the dipole-transition selection rule, the characteristic peaks in the energy range between 530 and 560 eV that are are denoted by B_{1}–B_{7}, obtained after convolution into seven peaks in the O K-edge XANES spectra of poly-crystal ZnO as shown in the upper inset of Fig. 3(b). These from O 1 s - derived states to 2p_{σ}-derived (along the bilayer) and O 2p_{π}-derived (along the c axis) states, which are approximately proportional to the density of the unoccupied O 2p-derived states [44–46]. The convolutions of O K-edge XANES spectra of single crystal and nanorod-ZnO are describes in the supplementary material. The characteristic peak before 532 eV is due to O 2p - Zn 4p and O 2p - Zn 4d hybridized states. The contributions in the absorption edge mainly arise from O 2p - Zn 4 s hybridized states [47]. The sharp intensity in the pre-edge structure of the films is due to the asymmetry of the wurtzite structure. The absorption intensity of all the peaks was found to decrease in single crystal and nanorod-ZnO as compared to poly-crystal-ZnO. This reduction of absorption intensity is associated with a decrease number of available empty O 2p states in single crystal and nanorod ZnO than poly-crystal-ZnO [44,45]. Similar observations were found in Zn L_{3}‐edge XANES spectra of single crystal, poly-crystal, and nanorod-ZnO. The absorption intensity is related to the amount of oxygen vacancies in the ZnO films. The more amount of oxygen vacancies as well as the occurrence of zinc defects causes the highest intensity peaks to appear in the XANES spectra of ZnO films [46,47]. The enhancement of these characteristic features represents the enhanced local density of states (DOS) that arise from the defects or dangling bonds in different ZnO nanostructures [48]. The polycrystalline ZnO films show higher absorption intensity with respect to single crystal and a nanorod ZnO indicating a higher population of defects and/or vacancies at O sites in polycrystalline ZnO films. This implies higher room temperature ferromagnetism.
To investigate the chemical states and bonding natures of the films, XPS measurements were performed. Figure 4(a) shows the Zn 2p core level spectra of single crystal, polycrystal, and nanorod ZnO. The binding energy of Zn 2p_{3/2} and Zn 2p_{1/2} peaks was observed around ∼1022.2 eV and ∼1045.3 eV in single crystal ZnO, ∼1022.1 eV and ∼1045.3 eV in poly-crystal ZnO, and 1022.4 eV and 1045.5 eV in nanorod-ZnO, respectively. A spin-orbit splitting of ∼23.1 eV of all three cases confirms the presence of Zn as Zn^{2+} in ZnO [49–51]. A negative shift of ∼0.1 eV and a positive shift of ∼0.2 eV were observed in Zn 2p_{3/2} peak of poly-crystal and nanorod ZnO with respect to single crystal ZnO. Similar observations were found by Tay et_al [52] in their studies. Tay et_al [52] observed that in ZnO with Type I defects (in our present case ZnO nanorod), the Zn 2p_{3/2} core level binding energy shifted to higher binding energy whereas in ZnO with Type II defects (in our present case poly-crystal ZnO), the Zn 2p_{3/2} core level binding energy shifted to lower binding energy. The valence band maximum (VBM) position also shifted to higher binding energy, which is discussed in the next section. Type I and Type II defects are mainly due to oxygen vacancies and/or zinc interstitials near the surface of ZnO that are assumed to be one of the reasons of room temperature ferromagnetic behaviour in ZnO [52]. The concentration of oxygen related defects gives a qualitative picture as there is a significant difference in the surface to volume ratio of all three sets of ZnO films. The O 1 s spectra of all ZnO films, shown in Fig. 4(b), are not completely symmetrical. The asymmetry nature of the peak is due to the various co-ordinations of oxygen in ZnO [39]. The O 1 s peaks of single crystal, poly-crystal, and nanorod ZnO films are de-convoluted into three Gaussian peaks and shown in Figs. 4(c)–4(e), respectively. The peaks at ∼530.8 ± 0.2 eV (I), ∼532.6 ± 0.2 eV (II), and ∼533.4 ± 0.2 eV (III) were observed in single crystal ZnO and nanorod ZnO films. All peaks in polycrystalline ZnO films were shifted to the lower binding energy, which could be attributed to the presence of type II surface defects in polycrystalline ZnO films as observed by Tay et_al [52] The peak-I is assigned to O^{2−} ions in the ZnO hexagonal wurtzite structure. The peak-II is attributed to oxygen deficient regions (oxygen vacancies) and the peak-III is due to adsorbed H_{2}O or O_{2} on the surface of ZnO [53,54]. We integrated the total area, took the ratio of each decomposed peak, and found that the atomic ratio of the peak-I to total oxygen was 85% in single crystal ZnO which was much higher when compared to the atomic ratio of the peak-I to total oxygen in polycrystalline ZnO films, which was about 55%. However, the atomic ratio of the peak-II to total oxygen, which is related to oxygen vacancies/defects, in poly-crystal ZnO films was appreciably higher (35%) than the atomic ratio of the peak-II to total oxygen in single crystal ZnO (6%). The atomic ratio of peak-II to total oxygen in nanorod ZnO (32%) was closer to the atomic ratio of peak-II to total oxygen in poly-crystal ZnO films (35%). So an increase in the ratio of peak-II to total oxygen in poly-crystal ZnO films compared to single crystal ZnO and nanorod ZnO confirms the increase in the amount of population of oxygen vacancies/defects [55], whose impact is well compatible with magnetic behaviours discussed above.
To gain further insight into the defect induced nature of ZnO, we have studied the valence band density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level by carrying out UPS measurements at He-I (21.22 eV). Figure 5 shows the valence band (VB) edge of the He-I spectra of single crystal, poly-crystal, and nanorod-ZnO, respectively. The Ag film was used to check the Fermi level edge (E_{f}), which was in excellent agreement with the excitation energy of the He-I line. The intersection of the slope of each spectrum in Fig. 5 [valence-band edge] with the extrapolated background provides the valence band maximum (VBM) position of all ZnO-films. The VBM positions of single crystal, poly-crystal, and nanorod-ZnO are 3.64 eV, 3.99 eVs and 3.71 eVs respectively; which are shown in the inset of Fig. 5. The positive energy shift of VBM in poly-crystal ZnO films with respect to single crystal ZnO is in good agreement with the XPS results obtained by Tay et_al [52] who have discussed that in ZnO with Type II defects (here poly-crystal ZnO), the Zn 2p_{3/2} core level binding energy shifted to lower binding energy and the VBM position shifted to higher binding energy. This upward binding energy shift in the VBM of poly-crystal ZnO films has been attributed to band bending at the surface [56].
The valence band photoemission spectra (VB-PES) corresponding to valence-band density of states of single crystal, poly-crystal, and nanorod-ZnO were measured using Synchrotron radiation at excitation energy hν = 385 eV and are shown in Fig. 6. The zero energy is referred to fermi energy level (E_{f}), where the intensity of the spectra gradually drops. As the valence bands in a solid are the least energetic, they contain the most weakly bound electrons which are responsible for the unique electronic and electrical properties of a material. The valence bands contribute significantly to the density of states (DOS) around the Fermi level. It was observed that the relative intensity of the spectra of poly-crystalline ZnO films near the Fermi level, which correlates with the valence band DOS, was higher than single crystal and nanorod-ZnO which could be ascribed due to the presence of more defects sites in poly-crystal ZnO films. The spectra are dominated by a major peak at a binding energy (E_{b}) of ∼11.9 eV (C_{4}), which is attributed to the Zn-3d band. In poly-crystal ZnO, this peak is shifted slightly towards the lower energy (E_{b} ∼11.2 eV) with respect to single crystal and nanorod-ZnO which is consistent with the XPS results as discussed above, which further implies the increase of VBM (the values are shown in Table I) [57]. In the valence band (VB) region, the peak of each ZnO films was de-convoluted into three Gaussian peaks at binding energies (E_{b}) of ∼5.2 eV (C_{1}), ∼6.1 eV (C_{2}), and ∼7.2 eV (C_{3}) and is shown in the inset of Fig. 6. The peak at ∼7.2 eV is due to O-2p orbitals hybridized with Zn-4 s and Zn-4p ones, the peak at ∼6.1 eV is due to Zn-3p, while the peak at ∼5.2 eV is attributed to the O-2p orbitals [58,59]. It can be seen that polycrystalline ZnO films exhibit significant changes in electronic states within the bandgap range. The intensity and the slope in the VB region of poly-crystal ZnO films were significantly higher than single crystal and nanorod-ZnO, which means the number of electrons, is also higher in the valence band of O 2p-Zn 4sp hybridized states of poly-crystal ZnO than single crystal ZnO [44]. The population of defects and/or vacancies at the O sites is also higher in polycrystalline ZnO films than single crystal and nanorod-ZnO, which enhances the DOS of O 2p-derived states near E_{f}, which is closely related to RT-FM in these films [46]. These findings are consistent with the M-H curves of the ZnO films as discussed above and shown in Fig. 2.
The presence of more defects/vacancies in polycrystalline ZnO films than single crystal and nanorod-ZnO was observed and confirmed via XANES, XPS, and VB-PES measurements. The enhancement of the intensity of the characteristic peaks in the XANES spectra of Zn L_{3}‐edge and O K-edge of polycrystalline ZnO films represents the increased local density of states (DOS) that arise from the defects or dangling bonds in ZnO nanostructures. The highest magnetic moment in polycrystalline ZnO films is strongly related to the enhancement of the VB-DOS of O 2p states close to E_{f}, because the population of defects and/or vacancies at the O sites in polycrystalline ZnO films were higher than single crystal and nanorod-ZnO. The coercivity values of polycrystalline ZnO films are the highest compared to single crystal and nanorod-ZnO, which has been attributed to an increase in the structural disorder leading to an increase in the anisotropy energy density which leads to an increase in the coercivity [60]. Due to high coercivity, poly-crystal ZnO can be considered as magnetically hard materials; whereas, single crystal and nanorod-ZnO show low coercivity and are termed as magnetically soft materials, which have a significant potential for different device applications. Comparatively, soft magnetic materials having low coercivity were observed in our single crystal ZnO and nanorod ZnO films. These magnetic behavioral materials could be used in electromagnetic applications; whereas, a comparatively hard magnetic material like poly-crystal ZnO could be used in spintronic application.
IV. CONCLUSION
A comparative study has been made for the defect induced room temperature ferromagnetism of single crystal, poly-crystal, and nanorod-ZnO based on the magnetic properties and electronic properties by means of XANES, XPS, UPS, VB-PES, and RT-ferromagnetism. XANES studies revealed that the number of unoccupied p states in poly-crystal ZnO was higher than single crystal as well as nanorod-ZnO. The enhancement of the characteristic peaks in XANES spectra of Zn L_{3}-edge and O K-edge of polycrystalline ZnO films represents the enhanced local density of states (DOS) that arise from the defects or dangling bonds in ZnO nanostructures. In poly-crystal ZnO, the binding energy of Zn 2p_{3/2} core level and O 1 s peak shifted to lower energy and the VBM position shifted to higher binding energy with respect to single crystal and nanorod-ZnO. This upward binding energy shift in VBM of poly-crystal ZnO films has been attributed to band bending near the surface. The atomic ratio of peak II to total oxygen in the O 1 s XPS spectra of poly-crystal ZnO films was appreciable higher than single crystal ZnO, suggesting that a higher amount of surface defects was present in poly-crystal ZnO, whose impact is well compatible with the magnetic studies of the films. The highest magnetic moment was achieved in polycrystalline ZnO films which were nearly ∼3.5 times higher than single crystal ZnO. This increased RT-FM in polycrystalline ZnO films is strongly related to the enhancement of the VB-DOS of O 2p states close to E_{f}, because the population of defects and/or vacancies at the O sites in polycrystalline ZnO films were higher than single crystal and nanorod-ZnO. This study confirms the formation of ZnO films in different type of soft and hard magnetic materials that could be used in different electronic and magnetic applications.

FIG. 1. 
XRD pattern of (a) single crystal ZnO, (b) polycrystalline ZnO films, and (c) nanorod-ZnO. XPS elemental mapping surface images of (d) single crystal ZnO, (e) polycrystalline ZnO, and (f) nanorod-ZnO films. Raman spectra of (g) single crystal ZnO, (h) polycrystalline ZnO, and (i) nanorod-ZnO films.
FIG. 2. 
Magnetic moment (M) versus magnetic field (H) curves of single crystal, polycrystalline, and nanorod-ZnO films. The lower inset shows the M-H curves in the low H range (−400 Oe to +400 Oe); whereas the upper inset shows the variation of M versus temperature (K) of the same three films.
FIG. 3. 
(a) Zn L_{3}-edge XANES spectra and (b) O K-edge XANES spectra of single crystal ZnO, polycrystalline ZnO films, and nanorod-ZnO before background subtraction. The lower inset of (a) and (b) shows the same spectra of the same three films after the background subtraction using a best-fitted Gaussian curve indicated by the black empty circle line, whereas the upper inset of (a) and (b) shows the de-convoluted features of Zn L_{3}-edge XANES and O K-edge XANES spectra of polycrystalline ZnO films.
FIG. 4. 
XPS core-level spectra of (a) Zn 2p and (b) O 1s. De-convoluted features of the O 1 s peak of (c) single crystal ZnO, (d) polycrystalline ZnO, and (e) nanorod ZnO films. The black solid curves represent the measured spectra and the open circle represents the fitted results.
FIG. 5. 
VBM position of single crystal, poly-crystal, and nanorod ZnO films obtained from UPS-He-I (hν = 21.22 eV) measurement. The Ag film is used as reference and inset in each case.
FIG. 6. 
VB-PES spectra of single crystal, poly-crystal, and nanorod ZnO. The inset shows the de-convoluted features of the peak in the valence band region.
