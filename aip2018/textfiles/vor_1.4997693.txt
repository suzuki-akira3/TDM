Variables separation and superintegrability of the nine-dimensional MICZ-Kepler problem
The nine-dimensional MICZ-Kepler problem is of recent interest. This is a system describing a charged particle moving in the Coulomb field plus the field of a SO(8) monopole in a nine-dimensional space. Interestingly, this problem is equivalent to a 16-dimensional harmonic oscillator via the Hurwitz transformation. In the present paper, we report on the multiseparability, a common property of superintegrable systems, and the superintegrability of the problem. First, we show the solvability of the Schrödinger equation of the problem by the variables separation method in different coordinates. Second, based on the SO(10) symmetry algebra of the system, we construct explicitly a set of seventeen invariant operators, which are all in the second order of the momentum components, satisfying the condition of superintegrability. The found number 17 coincides with the prediction of (2n − 1) law of maximal superintegrability order in the case n = 9. Until now, this law is accepted to apply only to scalar Hamiltonian eigenvalue equations in n-dimensional space; therefore, our results can be treated as evidence that this definition of superintegrability may also apply to some vector equations such as the Schrödinger equation for the nine-dimensional MICZ-Kepler problem.
I. INTRODUCTION
The Kepler problem is one of the most fundamental problems in physics and, moreover, one of the physics systems of a very small percentage whose Schrödinger equation can be solved exactly. In 1960s, Zwanziger [1] and McIntosh and Cisneros [2] investigated the Kepler problem in the presence of the Dirac monopole potential. Interestingly, adding vector potential to the system does not affect the symmetry as well as the exact solvability of the initial system. The Kepler problem with a Dirac magnetic monopole has been called the MICZ-Kepler problem [3,4]. Naturally, the generalization of the problem to higher dimensional space has been of interest [4–11], especially, the MICZ-Kepler problem in a space of arbitrary dimension was given recently in the work of Meng [7].
The nine-dimensional MICZ-Kepler problem (9D MICZ-KP) is a generalization of the nine-dimensional Coulomb problem by addition of the SO(8) monopole potential. The SO(8) monopole was first introduced in the work of Grossman et_al [12] dedicated to the investigation of the last case of Hopf fibration [13,14], i.e., the octonionic bundle S_{15} → S_{8} with fiber S_{7} (see also the work of Pedder et_al) [15]. This SO(8) monopole field also appeared in the study of the Hall effect in eight-dimensional space [16]. On the other hand, the SO(8) monopole potential was found in the work of Le et_al [17] as a potential which needs to be added in the nine-dimensional Coulomb problem to obtain a 16-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator via the Hurwitz transformation. Interestingly, this kind of transformation, which changes the MICZ-Kepler problem to a harmonic oscillator, exists for only four cases of space dimension [17–21]: 2 → 2, 3 → 4, 5 → 8, and 9 → 16; hence, the last case 9 → 16, i.e., the 9D MICZ-KP, is special and has been of interest [10,17,22–25].
The 9D MICZ-KP has been proved to have hidden SO(10) symmetry [22] and SO(10, 2) dynamic symmetry [23], which are also the symmetry of the nine-dimensional Coulomb system. Moreover, the Schrödinger equation of the considered problem has been solved exactly by the algebraic method [23] as well as by the analytical method [24], showing explicitly the energy spectrum and its degeneration degree. In Ref [24], the wave functions are obtained by the variables separation method in spherical coordinates and seem to be solvable in parabolic coordinates. All these results give clues that the 9D MICZ-KP is superintegrable [25–29]. In this paper, we propose a way to build explicitly a set of seventeen operators, satisfying the superintergrable condition based on the SO(10) symmetry.
The structure of the paper is as follows. In Sec. II, the solvability of the Schrödinger equation is demonstrated by the variables separation method in two different coordinate systems: spherical and parabolic coordinates. In Sec. III, the SO(10) symmetry of the system, which is necessary for building the set of operators, is revisited. Here, the geometric symmetry is represented in the form of a 9 × 9 second-order tensor together with the generalized Runge-Lenz vector—another integral of motion related to hidden symmetry. Based on the symmetry of the system, we construct the explicit form of the seventeen operators and prove that the system is actually maximally superintegrable.
II. VARIABLES SEPARATION OF THE 9D MICZ-KEPLER PROBLEM
The 9D MICZ-KP describes the motion of a particle with electric charge and isospin in the field of a dyon—a particle with both electric charge and magnetic charge in nine-dimensional space. The time-independent Schrödinger equation of the problem in atomic units has the form [22]
where Z is the nuclear electric charge; E is the energy of the system; π^{2} = π_{μ}π_{μ} with the generalized momentum operators defined as
Note that the system now exhibits an interaction between the “isospin” and the SO(8) monopole field beside the Coulomb interaction. This interaction is represented in terms of the components A_{k}(r)Q_{kj} with
We utilize the notation Q^{2} = Q_{kj}Q_{kj} (k > j) with 28 independent anti-symmetric operators Q_{kj}, satisfying the following commutation relations of the SO(8) group:
In the above equations and in the rest of this paper, the repetition of Latin indices (j) means summation on the range from 1 to 8, and the repetition of Greek indices (λ) means summation on the range from 1 to 9; unless otherwise indicated.
By plugging formulae (2) into Eq. (1), the Schrödinger equation now becomes
where the Laplace-Beltrami operator Δ and the operators L_{kj} are defined as
Obviously, the operators L_{kj} are anti-symmetric with the interchange of indices j and k and satisfy the commutation relations of the SO(8) algebra,
The solution of the Schrödinger equation by the variables separation method has been clearly given in the work of Nguyen et_al [24] for the case of spherical coordinates. Here, we first review those results and then apply the variables separation method to the case of parabolic coordinates in order to illustrate the multiseparation of the problem.
A. Variables separation of the Schrödinger equation in spherical coordinates
Because the operators Q_{kj} can be parameterized by seven angular variables of the S_{7} sphere: φ̃{0},φ̃{1},φ̃{2},φ̃{3},φ̃{4},φ̃{5},φ̃{6}, it is more convenient to choose a coordinate system on the S_{7} sphere such as the nine-dimensional spherical coordinates as follows:
where the value ranges of the coordinates are
Under this transformation, the Laplace-Beltrami operator can be rewritten as
where L^{2} = L_{kj}L_{kj} (k > j). The 56 operators L_{kj} depend on the seven angles φ_{s} (s = 0, …, 6) only and form a closed SO(8) algebra; i.e., they satisfy the commutation relations given by Eq. (7). Thus the Schrödinger equation in spherical coordinates has the form
In the above equation and from now on, the notation φ represents the set of seven angular variables {φ_{0}, φ_{1}, φ_{2}, φ_{3}, φ_{4}, φ_{5}, φ_{6}} of the coordinate system, while φ̃ represents the set of seven angular parameters {φ_{0}̃,φ_{1}̃,φ_{2}̃,φ_{3}̃,φ_{4}̃,φ_{5}̃,φ_{6}̃} of the SO(8) monopole potential.
Equation (10) can be solved by the variables separation method using the ansatz
The hyperspherical harmonic functions Φ(φ,φ̃) are the eigenfunctions of both operators L^{2}(φ) and J^{2}(φ,φ̃), where J^{2} = J_{kj}J_{kj} (k > j) with the definition J_{kj} = L_{kj} + Q_{kj} [24],
The Schrödinger equation (10) rewritten in terms of these new operators
now can be easily separated into equations of variables r, θ and angular variables φ,φ̃,
where λ is the separation factor.
B. Variables separation of the Schrödinger equation in parabolic coordinates
Similar to the spherical coordinates, we choose the transformation to separate variables in the parabolic coordinates on the S_{7} sphere as follows:
where the value ranges of the coordinates are
Under this transformation, the Laplace-Beltrami operator can be rewritten as
The Schrödinger equation in parabolic coordinates then can be rewritten as
In order to separate variables, the wave function is now required in the form
Similar to the case of spherical coordinates, by introducing new operators J_{kj} = L_{kj} + Q_{kj} and regarding the hyperspherical harmonic functions Φ(φ,φ̃) as eigenfunctions of the operators L^{2}(φ) and J^{2}(φ,φ̃),
the Schrödinger equation (21) can be rewritten in terms of these new operators
and hence easily separated into equations of variables u, v and angular variables φ,φ̃,
where P is the separation factor.
III. SUPERINTEGRABILITY OF THE PROBLEM
The solvability by the variables separation method in spherical and parabolic coordinates as shown in Secs. II A and II B is a good sign of superintegrability of the problem. Generally, a quantum system in n-dimensional space is called integrable if it admits n independent operators {X_{1} ≡ H, X_{2}, …, X_{n}} which all commute with each other. The system is called superintegrable if beside n independent operators X_{j}, there also exists other k independent operators {Y_{1}, Y_{2}, …, Y_{k}} which all commute with the Hamiltonian, but are not required to commute with each other. If k = n − 1, the system is called maximally superintegrable [25–29]. Although the definition of superintegrability until now is accepted to apply to scalar Hamiltonian eigenvalue equations, we realize that the existence of such independent operators for the considered system may serve as the evidence that this definition also applies to some vector equations, in particular, to the Schrödinger equation of the nine-dimensional MICZ-Kepler problem. In the case of n = 9, we need 9 X-operators and 8 Y-operators to prove the maximal superintegrability. In this section, we first review the result of symmetry group so(10) of the 9D MICZ-KP and then construct the set of 17 operators based on this symmetry group [22,25].
A. Symmetry algebra of the 9D MICZ-Kepler problem
We reuse the original Schrödinger equation (1). With the presence of the SO(8) monopole, the orbital angular momentum is no longer invariant. Instead, the new symmetry is described by the generalized orbital angular momentum represented in the form of a 9 × 9 tensor [22],
where the components are defined as
From the definition (31), the tensor Λ is anti-symmetric; hence there are only 36 independent components. By direct calculation, commutation relations between tensor components can be obtained as
We can also check that all the components Λ_{μν} commute with the Hamiltonian of the system,
which means the nine-dimensional MICZ-Kepler problem has the geometric symmetry of SO(9).
Beside the geometric symmetry represented by the operators Λ_{μν}, there is a hidden symmetry described by the generalized Runge-Lenz vector whose components have the explicit form [22]
The direct calculation using this definition leads to
which implies that the introduced vector M is an integral of motion representing the hidden symmetry of the problem under investigation.
The generalized orbital angular momentum and the generalized Runge-Lenz vector can be combined together in order to describe higher symmetry. It is more convenient to denote
and introduce the matrix operator D (10 × 10) as
The commutation relations between all the elements of matrix D can be written as
and therefore, the D-matrix satisfies the SO(10) algebra.
B. The integrability
First, from the group so(9) represented by the ∧-matrix, we build 8 subgroups so(m) (m = 2, 3, …, 9). The rule of construction is to take the top left m × m block matrix of the Λ-matrix as
From the definition of the Λ-matrix, it is obvious that X(m)s are anti-symmetric matrices with their components satisfying SO(m) algebra described by the commutation relations similar to (32).
Now, 8 operators X_{m} are defined as second-order Casimir operators of the subgroups so(m), according to the formula
where the repetition of indices i, j means summation from 1 to m. By their definition, these invariant Casimir operators constructed from operators, which all commute with the Hamiltonian, must also commute with the Hamiltonian, i.e.,
Besides, this set of subgroups satisfies so(2)⊂so(3)⊂…so(9), which states the fact that these 8 Casimir operators are all independent.
Using commutators (32), we can verify that
where the notation {A, B} is for anti-commutator, i.e., {A, B} = AB + BA; and the notation {A, B, C} means {A, B, C} = {A, {B, C}}. From this commutation relation and from the definition of operators X_{m}, it is easy to check the following equations:
The existence of Eq. (43) together with relations (41) means the set {X_{1} ≡ H, X_{2}, …, X_{9}} has elements which completely commute with each other, implying that the 9D MICZ-KP is integrable.
C. The maximal superintegrability
There is another way to build the set of 8 subgroups similar to that given in Subsection III B. Indeed, the subgroups can be constructed by the bottom right m × m matrices of the Λ-matrix as
Similarly to the construction of X_{m}, eight operators Y_{m} are defined as second-order invariant Casimir operators from eight subgroups Y (m) as follows:
Constructed from basis elements of the symmetric group of the problem, these eight invariant Casimir operators Y_{m} obviously commute with the Hamiltonian. Matrices Y(9) and X(9) are the same, and hence the operators Y_{9} and X_{9} are also the same. Therefore, eight operators Y_{m} and eight operators X_{m} together with the Hamiltonian compose a set of sixteen independent invariant operators.
Related to the hidden symmetry of the system, the generalized Runge-Lenz vector is invariant; thus its first component M_{1} can be chosen for the last seventeenth invariant operator. Up to now, we have constructed a set of seventeen operators as {X_{1} ≡ H, X_{2}, …, X_{9}, Y_{2}, …, Y_{8}, M_{1}} that satisfies the superintegrability conditions
Note that all these seventeen operators are second order in the momenta, so we can conclude that the 9D MICZ-KP is second-order maximally superintegrable. As mentioned above, the usual definition of superintegrability is accepted to apply to scalar equations; therefore, these results can be treated as evidence that this definition may apply to some vector equations. It should be noted that the way we construct the set of seventeen operators is based on the method given in Ballesteros’s studies [30,31].
We also emphasize that there are different ways to choose the set of operators. For example, we can choose the first nine independent commuting operators as {H, Y_{2}, Y_{3}, …, Y_{9}}, where operators Y_{m} are constructed from subgroups Y(m). Similar to the set of operators X, by direct calculation we can prove that these eight operators Y_{m} all commute with each other, i.e.,
Addition of eight more operators {A, X_{2}, …, X_{8}} to {H, Y_{2}, Y_{3}, …, Y_{9}}, where A is any linear combination of nine components of the generalized Runge-Lenz vector, gives us a set of seventeen operators that satisfies the maximally superintegrable conditions.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
We have shown that the 9D MICZ-KP can be solved by the variables separation method, not only in spherical coordinates but also in parabolic coordinates. This multiseparability is widely known as a common sign of superintegrable systems. Based on the SO(10) symmetric algebra of the 9D MICZ-KP, we also establish explicitly a set of seventeen independent operators, which are all second order and commute with the Hamiltonian. This set of operators allows us to conclude that the problem is second-order maximally superintegrable. These results serve as evidence that the definition of superintegrability may also apply to some vector equations such as the 9D MICZ-KP.
