Temperature dependence of reduced offset in double Hall sensor structure reducing voltage offset
We have recently described the principle of operation of a double Hall sensor structure (DHSS) reducing the voltage offset [M. Oszwałdowski and S. El-Ahmar, Rev. Sci. Instrum. 88, 075005 (2017)]. The correctness of operation of the structure and its characteristic features were checked and clarified experimentally using the structures made of InSb thin films. In the present paper, we investigate the very important problem of the temperature dependence of the reduced offset in the DHSS. We show that the reduced voltage temperature dependence is entirely governed by the temperature dependence of the resistance of the component Hall sensors. If the averaged temperature dependence of the resistance of both the component Hall sensors were the same in a given temperature range, the reduced offset of the DHSS can be virtually independent of temperature in that temperature range. This behavior is confirmed by experimental investigations performed on DHSSs made of InSb thin films.
I. INTRODUCTION
In a previous work [1], we have considered general features, including the principle of operation, of the double Hall sensor structure (DHSS) reducing the voltage offset. The offset reduction is very important because the offset is always added to the Hall voltage and by that decreases the accuracy of measurements of the magnetic field magnitude in the magnetometers based on the Hall effect. The principle of operation of the DHSS has been described in detail and confirmed by an experimental work, in which the structures were made of InSb thin films. However, the very important problem of thermal stability of the reduced offset of the DHSS was not considered in the previous work. This is the goal of the present work.
In spite of the fact that the schematic diagram of the DHSS was presented in our earlier article [1], here for the convenience of the reader, we present it once again in Fig. 1 in the version realizable with the standard thin film technology methods.
The DHSS is composed of two standard Hall sensors that are activated with two currents I_{1} and I_{2} from electrically independent current sources. The currents are injected to the electrodes 5 and 1, respectively. An important feature of the DHSS is that by slightly changing the supplying currents at their values close to the condition I_{1} = I_{2}, it is possible to change the sign of the offset. This means that it is always possible to pass through the zero value of the offset. However, the smallest value of the stable offset that was possible to obtain in our work was 10 μV because of the disturbing effect of the electric noise. 10 μV was obtained by reducing the offset of the DHSS by two orders of magnitude. The minimum value of the magnetic field equivalent offset in investigated DHSSs was around 60 μT.
The temperature dependence of a Hall sensor offset is very important, and hence, it was studied many times in the past. The origin of the offset usually is geometrical inaccuracy introduced to the Hall plate during its manufacturing process. That inaccuracy results in the generation of electric voltage between the Hall effect electrodes. The offset resulting from the voltage electrodes’ misalignment is always proportional to the driving current, and its temperature dependence is proportional to the temperature dependence of the sensor input resistance. That means that the offset temperature drift depends on the electrical properties of the semiconductor Hall plate only. The situation is changed when the Hall device is composed of more than a single Hall bar, and its offset is considerably reduced by special means. In such a case, the offset temperature drift may depend on the reduction level and method. In view of that, we think that for further comparison of our results on the offset temperature drift with those obtained earlier, it is purposeful to make a short review of the earlier results. We consider only the results obtained by methods that enable one to reduce the offset to the microvolt level. It appears that there are only two such methods. In the first method, the offset reduction is performed in a Hall device that is composed of two single Hall sensors supplied with two independent driving currents. In the second method, the offset is reduced with the so-called spinning current method. In that method, a symmetric cross-shaped Hall sensor is supplied with driving current that is periodically commutated between the current and the voltage electrodes.
The double current technique was first time applied to the structure named Hall-bar-with-hole [2]. In this structure, two independent Hall effects can be observed using internal and external contacts. The authors find that it results from the principle of operation of that Hall device that the offset can be totally reduced. This is because the current noise is also reduced in the applied reduction procedure. However, experimental investigations performed on a Hall-bar-with-hole having 300 μm in length made of GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure showed that in practice, the offset can be reduced by about two orders of magnitude. Further investigations of the offset reduction performed on silicon sensors [3] showed that in that case, the offset can also be reduced by about two orders of magnitude. The authors suggest that further offset reduction is limited by mechanical stress introduced to the Si Hall sensors in the sensor encapsulation procedure.
The double current technique was also applied to the offset reduction in the double-Hall device [4]. This device is simply a single symmetric Hall sensor in which two independent Hall effects are simultaneously generated by interchanging the current and the voltage electrodes. Measurements performed on silicon sensors obtained by the CMOS procedure showed that the offset can be reduced to about 50 μV, which is a reduction larger than two orders of magnitude. That reduction corresponds to the magnetic field equivalent offset of about 12 μT. Between −10 °C and +80 °C, the offset increases with the rate of about 0.5 μV/°C.
Another double-Hall sensor in which a signal offset compensated by the double current technique is a device described earlier by Steiner et_al [5] It consists of two single Hall sensors sharing the same active area. The sensors have the current and the voltage electrodes on the same side of the Hall plate [6], and they are merged along the sides not having the electrodes. Such obtained double-Hall sensor detects the magnetic induction perpendicular to the plate surface. In silicon double-Hall sensor made by a standard CMOS process, the offset was reduced by more than 500 times in comparison to that measured in the single Hall sensors. That resulted in obtaining the magnetic field equivalent offset smaller than 2 mT. The thermal offset drift was lower than 11 μT/°C.
The well-known spinning current method was invented by Munter [7]. The method uses only one single symmetrical Hall plate in which the direction of the current is made to spin by contact commutation. The consecutive Hall voltages are averaged over time, and the offset cancels out. The spinning current method has been developed in many subsequent articles, especially those in which the Hall sensor is a part of IC and the current spinning process is performed within the IC. The advantage of the spinning current method is that the Hall signal is AC voltage before averaging, which substantially reduces the electric noise. Hence, the voltage reductions below 10 μV were obtained [8]. In Ref [8], the authors investigated the effect of the shape of the Hall plate on the offset in the Hall sensors integrated in a 0.35-μm CMOS technology. They found that the minimal offset and offset temperature drift are observed in symmetric cross-shaped Hall sensors. In this case, the minimal offset was 1.5 μV and magnetic equivalent offset was 25 μT. The offset drift was reduced approximately to 0.1 μT/°C. These results are the best so far. Therefore, in all the papers considered, the offset was reduced by about two orders of magnitude to the level of microvolts.
II. SAMPLES
The investigated DHSSs were prepared in the thin film form exploiting InSb thin films for that purpose. Two sorts of InSb thin films were prepared by two different preparation methods [1]. The electrical parameters of these films are presented in Table I. This table is a reduced form of Table I presented in Ref [1].
The InSb films obtained by the regrowth from the melt are expected to have larger resistance inhomogeneity than the InSb films obtained by epitaxial growth on the i-GaAs substrate. We decided to use these two sorts of InSb thin films expecting that the resistance inhomogeneity may have an effect on the offset temperature dependence.
The preparation method of the single Hall sensors and of the DHSSs made of them was given in the earlier article [1].
III. TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE OF REDUCED OFFSET
An important property of each Hall sensor is its temperature dependence of the voltage offset. Before studying the temperature dependence of the reduced offset in the DHSSs, their single sensors were covered with a protective SiO_{x} (1 < x < 2) layer being 130 nm thick and subsequently annealed in air at a temperature of 270 °C for 15 min. The aim of this procedure is to stabilize the DHSS electrical parameters during the annealing. After the annealing, the voltage offset at 25 °C is not changed, i.e., it is the same as before annealing. The thermal cycles, during which the reduced offset is measured, are performed between 25 °C and 60 °C. The measurement results are shown in Fig. 2. DHSS numbering follows on the single Hall sensor numbering, e.g., DHSS 907 is composed of single sensors 907-1 and 907-2.
In the figure, we present separately the results of DHSSs made of InSb films obtained by the vacuum epitaxy [Fig. 2(a)] and those obtained by the regrowth from the melt [Fig. 2(b)]. We expected that because the InSb obtained by the regrowth method have larger electric inhomogeneities, which must result in a larger distribution in the temperature dependence of the film resistivity, the regrown InSb films might show a larger temperature dependence of the reduced offset. Actually, it is observed in Fig. 2 that the electrical inhomogeneities are not a decisive factor for the temperature dependence of the reduced offset. This may be understandable as it results from the principle of operation of the DHSS that the reduced offset can depend on the temperature only when the averaged temperature coefficients of the resistance of the single Hall sensors H_{1} and H_{2} are different.
In order to interpret the temperature dependence of the reduced offsets shown in Fig. 2, we will now consider the temperature dependence of the resistivity of investigated InSb thin films. For this purpose, we can assume that for the undoped or lightly donor-doped InSb thin films, their resistivity, ρ = 1/enμ, depends on the temperature only through the temperature dependence of the electron density, n, and the electron mobility μ is temperature independent, and thus
In the case of donor-doped InSb, the electron density is
where N_{d} is the effective density of ionized donors and n_{i} is the intrinsic electron concentration. In indium antimonide at room temperature, n_{i} is close to 10^{16} cm^{−3}. InSb having the donor density above 10^{15} cm^{−3} form a donor band, which overlaps with the conduction band. This means that there is no energy gap between the donor levels and the edge of the conduction band. For that reason, the donors are always ionized independent of temperature, and thus the electron density generated by the donors is independent of temperature. Hence, it results from Eqs. (1) and (2) that the temperature coefficient of the resistivity α of the InSb thin films is
This equation shows that when N_{d}<<n_{i}, the temperature coefficient of the resistivity is independent of the effective donor density and is equal to the temperature coefficient of the resistivity of intrinsic InSb, which is about −1.3%/^{o}C. On the other hand, when N_{d} ≫ n_{i}, the temperature coefficient of the resistivity of the strongly donor-doped InSb is inversely proportional to the donor density, which means that the coefficient is very low.
We now use Eq. (3) to the interpretation of the temperature dependence of the reduced offset of the DHSSs shown in Fig. 2. Let us consider first DHSSs 907 and 931. The single Hall sensors H_{1} and H_{2} of these DHSSs have the electron density of about 2 × 10^{16} cm^{−3}. However, in the case of DHSS 907, the electron densities of the single sensors are different; namely, they are 1.9 × 10^{16} cm^{−3} and 2.2 × 10^{16} cm^{−3} (see Table I). This means that they must have different donor densities [see Eq. (2)]. In such a case, in accord with Eq. (3), they must have different temperature coefficients of the resistivity. The temperature dependences of the resistance of the single Hall sensors of DHSS 907 and their corresponding resistivity temperature coefficients as a function of temperature are shown in Fig. 3.
The temperature dependence of the temperature coefficients of the resistivity, α(T), shown in the inset is calculated from Eq. (3). The values of N_{d} are determined from Eq. (2) assuming for n(T) the measurement result obtained at room temperature. The temperature dependence of the intrinsic concentration n_{i}(T) for InSb are taken from Ref [9].
It may be observed in Fig. 3 that the temperature dependences of the resistance of the single sensors of DHSS 907 are different, and consequently, the temperature dependences of their resistivity temperature coefficients are different too. In a result, one observes a relatively strong thermal drift of the offset in DHSS 907 close to room temperature. At higher temperatures, the offset temperature dependence saturates because the temperature coefficients tend to become equal. They become equal because both the sensors enter in the intrinsic conduction range. It may be anticipated that at higher temperatures, above 100 °C, the offset temperature dependence curve will fully saturate. The same is true for all the DHSSs, which at higher temperatures enter in the intrinsic conduction range. Their offsets must become temperature independent because their single Hall sensors have the same resistivity temperature coefficients.
In contrast to DHSS 907, DHSS 931 being also in the intrinsic conductivity range shows a much weaker temperature dependence of the reduced offset. The reason is that the electron density in both its single Hall sensors is equal and amounts to 1.6 × 10^{16} cm^{−3}. Thus, their donor concentration must be equal or negligibly small, and as it results from Eq. (3), the temperature coefficients of the resistivity of the Hall sensors H_{1} and H_{2} must be equal or very close. This explains why the temperature dependence of the reduced offset of DHSS 931 is relatively weak. Actually, the offset of this DHSS should be temperature independent. The small minimum of the offset seen in Fig. 2 may be associated with the experimental conditions. The single Hall sensors are shifted in space, and thus they may go temporary to slightly different temperatures, which results in the generation of a small offset.
Consider now DHSS 913 and DHSS 917+919. The electron density of the single Hall sensors of these two DHSSs is relatively large, and hence n is considerably larger than n_{i}. Thus, the donor density in the single Hall sensors must also be considerably larger than n_{i} (=2 × 10^{16} cm^{−2}), and as it results from Eq. (3), the temperature coefficients of the resistance of the single Hall sensors must be relatively small. In the case of DHSS 917+919, its single Hall sensors have the largest and equal electron density of 1.6 × 10^{17} cm^{−3} (see Table I). Hence, one can anticipate that the temperature dependence of the reduced offset of this DHSS will be negligible. This is fully confirmed in Fig. 2(a). With the accuracy of the measurements, the temperature dependence of the reduced offset of this DHSS is close to zero.
In the case of DHSS 913, the electron density in its single Hall sensors is slightly smaller than that in DHSS 917+919, and in addition, the density in both the sensors is slightly different.
The temperature dependence of the resistance and the resistivity in these single sensors are shown in Fig. 3. The figure confirms that in comparison with the sensors 907-1 and 907-2, the temperature dependence of the resistance of the sensors 913-1 and 913-2 is relatively weak and the temperature coefficients of the resistivity are virtually the same. Hence, the temperature dependence of the reduced offset of DHSS 913 must also be very weak, which is confirmed experimentally in Fig. 2(a).
The electron density in single Hall sensors of DHSS 934 and DHSS 934a is about 5.5 × 10^{16} cm^{−3} (see Table I). This electron density is higher than those found in the single Hall sensors of DHSS 907 and DHSS 931 and lower than those found in the single Hall sensors of DHSS 917+919 and DHSS 913. Therefore, performing considerations analogous to those presented above, one can deduce that the temperature coefficient of the resistance of the single sensors of DHSS 934 and DHSS 934a is smaller than that of DHSS 907 and DHSS 931 and larger than that of DHSS 917+919 and DHSS 913. On the other hand, the temperature coefficients of the resistance of the single sensors of DHSS 934 and DHSS 934a must be different, as the electron densities of these single Hall sensors are different. Consequently, the reduced offset of DHSS 934 and DHSS 934a must increase with temperature. This increase should be slightly larger for DHSS 934 as the difference in the electron density between its single Hall sensors is slightly larger. These predictions are fully confirmed by the measurements, as shown in Fig. 2(b).
Thus it results that the experimental temperature dependence of reduced offset voltage of DHSSs shown in Fig. 2 can be fully explained by a theoretical approach based on the assumption that it totally depends on the temperature coefficient of the resistance of the single Hall sensors, which are components of the given DHSS. This is independent of the sensors’ resistance value. It results that if the temperature coefficients of both single sensor resistances are equal, the temperature dependence of the reduced offset is small, especially when the temperature coefficient of the single sensors is also small. In the other case, the temperature dependence of the reduced offset voltage of DHSSs can be meaningful. These rules are independent of the structural properties of the InSb thin films used for manufacturing of the single Hall sensors, in particular on the distribution of macroscopic structural defects electrically active. Thus, our expectation that these defects can play an important role in the temperature behaviour of the DHSS offset is not confirmed in the present experiments.
IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Experimental temperature dependence of the reduced offset in samples of Double Hall Sensor Structures (DHSSs) made of InSb thin films is investigated. Two sorts of weakly or medium donor-doped InSb thin films having different resistance inhomogeneities in the InSb film plane are used in the investigations. It appears that the electric inhomogeneities are unimportant for the offset reduction process effectiveness and its thermal stability. A possible explanation of that is that the electric inhomogeneity effect is averaged across the Hall plate.
The analysis of the experimental results presented in Fig. 2 suggests that the temperature dependence of the reduced offset in the DHSS may be associated with the coefficient of temperature dependence of the resistance of the single Hall sensors. This suggestion results from the principle of operation of DHSS anticipating that the reduced offset can depend on temperature when the averaged temperature coefficients of the resistance of the single Hall sensors were different.
To confirm this suggestion, an equation describing the temperature coefficient of the resistivity of the investigated InSb thin films [Eq. (3)] is derived. This equation fully explains the reduced offset temperature dependences shown in Fig. 2. In particular, it results that if the temperature coefficients of the resistance of the single Hall sensors are small and the difference between them is also small, the temperature dependence of the reduced offset in the DHSS becomes negligibly small. This conclusion resulting from the principle of operation of DHSS has a general character, and it is independent of the semiconductor material of which the single Hall sensors are obtained. However, when the offset is reduced to the microvolt level, its temperature dependence can be influenced by fluctuation phenomena such as the electric noise and also by small thermoelectric voltages generated by small temperature gradients within and between the single Hall sensors.
In the earlier paper [1], we have suggested that the DHSS can very effectively reduce the large offset voltage in graphene Hall sensors. The present investigations show that reduced voltage should be thermally stable in a broad range of temperatures because the temperature coefficient of the resistivity of graphene is small in a broad range of temperatures [10].
In our short review in the Introduction, we have concluded that the offset reduction can be performed most effectively with the help of one of the two methods: the double current technique and the spinning current method. With each of these methods, the offset can be reduced by two orders of magnitude or even more. Our DHSS belongs to the double current technique group. However, in the other offset reduction methods, one assumes that both the single sensors must have exactly the same parameters. We have shown that assumption is not necessary in the case of DHSS. In our DHSSs, effective offset reduction could be performed even when their single sensors had different resistances and magnetic sensitivities However, to obtain a small temperature dependence of the reduced offset, their temperature dependence of the resistance had to be equal.
In our DHSSs, the smallest thermal drift is observed in those having the donor concentration of about 10^{17} cm^{−3}. In these sensors, the temperature dependence of the resistance is relatively small and the difference in the temperature dependence of the resistance between the single Hall sensors is usually very small. Between 25 °C and 60 °C, the thermal offset drift in DHSS 913 is 1,4 μV/°C, and in DHSS 917+919, the offset is temperature independent. In the later case, because the temperature dependence of the resistance of the single sensors is the same, it may be expected that the temperature independence of the offset must exist in a much wider temperature range. Therefore, DHSSs based on InSb thin films doped with 10^{17} cm^{−3} donors can be excellent magnetic sensors having very small and thermally stable offset.
