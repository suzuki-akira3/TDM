Pulsed laser deposition of zinc vanadates from a ZnV_{2}O_{6} target
Zinc vanadate thin films, which have the property of band gap tunability together with interesting optical and electrical properties, are excellent candidates for optoelectronic applications such as solar cells. But so far, no reports on thin films deposition of zinc vanadates exist in literature. In the present work, zinc vanadate compounds were grown on glass substrates at room temperature by pulsed laser deposition. A polycrystalline ZnV_{2}O_{6} target synthesized by melt quenching was used for the ablation process. The physical properties of the films were analyzed as a function of density and the mean kinetic energy of ions in the plasma. As-deposited films were amorphous, and after annealing at 500 °C in air, the crystalline structure of the samples changed depending on the plasma density. Raman spectroscopy measurements showed the presence of several vibrational modes in different regions of the annealed samples, indicating the presence of different crystalline phases. The band gap values were 2.77 and 2.82 eV for the as-deposited samples and 3.17, 3.09, and 1.73 eV for the heat treated cases. As-grown samples presented a broad luminescence band in the visible region of the spectrum with features that depended on the plasma density.
I. INTRODUCTION
Bulk zinc vanadate glasses have been the subject of intensive studies due to their semiconducting, optical, electronic, electrochemical properties, and their possible applications in energy storage [1–5]. Crystalline phases of the zinc vanadate compounds exhibit the possibility of band gap modification by the control of the crystalline structure and chemical composition. Reducing dimensions on vanadate compounds by the deposition of thin films is of interest due to the possibility of achieving materials with excellent properties for their use in optoelectronic applications by offering the possibility of being integrated to devices where thin films are needed. No reports on thin film deposition of zinc vanadates exist in literature. However, pellets have been achieved by techniques such as Sol-Gel [2].
Band gap tunability along with the optical and electrical properties makes zinc vanadate thin films excellent candidates for optoelectronic applications. For instance, in solar cells, zinc vanadate thin films could be used as absorbers or window layers. If a narrow gap (∼1.5 eV) material could be obtained, it may be used as the absorbing layer, provided appropriate conductivity is also achieved. On the other hand, films with wider band gap values (above 2.5 eV) could be used as window layers. The band gap tunability of the films presented here allows foreseeing optoelectronic applications such as photovoltaic technology.
Among the different deposition techniques that could be used for the synthesis of vanadate films, pulsed laser deposition (PLD) offers some advantages due to the nature of the phenomena involved in the laser-target interactions (ablation), which include nonequilibrium processes that could lead to the growth of metastable phases, which are not possible with other techniques [6]. Besides, it has been reported that PLD is a suitable and widely used technique for the growth of multicomponent oxide films due to the possibility of controlling composition by the plasma interactions, which are strongly dependent on the experimental conditions (pressure, background gas, laser fluence, etc.) [7,8].
In the present work, zinc vanadium oxide films were grown by pulsed laser deposition, and the results showed that the structural and optical properties after annealing are strongly dependent on the deposition pressure and, thus, on the plasma density.
II. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS
For target preparation, powders of ZnO (Sigma-Aldrich) and V_{2}O_{5} (Sigma-Aldrich) were mixed in a crucible in 50–50 mol. %, the mixture was melted at 650 °C by using the melt-quenching method, and it was kept at this temperature for 24 h. The resulting material was a disk of ZnV_{2}O_{6} of approximately 1 in. diameter with 0.25 in. of thickness. Figure 1 shows the diffraction pattern of the target where the peaks corresponding to ZnV_{2}O_{6} (ICDD#01-074-1262) can be observed. The inset shows a plot of (hν F(R))^{2} versus the photon energy (hν), where F(R) is the Kubelka–Munk relation obtained from ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) diffuse reflectance measurements acquired by a Cary 100 Varian spectrometer. The band gap energy (E_{g}) was estimated extrapolating the absorption edge to the photon energy axis through a linear fit [9].
For the pulsed laser deposition process, a neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet; Nd:Y_{3}Al_{5}O_{12} (Nd:YAG) laser with 500 mJ of maximum output energy, a wavelength of 1064 nm, 5 ns pulse width, and frequency of 10 Hz was used. The deposition chamber was evacuated to a base pressure of 5 × 10^{−6} mbar. The thin film depositions were carried out by ablating a ZnV_{2}O_{6} target at an angle of incidence of 30° with respect to a normal line to the target. First, one deposit was done at the vacuum base pressure (5 × 10^{−6} mbar) with a laser fluence of 2 J/cm^{2} on the target. A second film was deposited using a commercial mixture of oxygen/argon (20%/80%) atmosphere from INFRA at a pressure of 2 × 10^{−2} mbar with a fluence of 2 J/cm^{2}. Finally, a third film was deposited reproducing the same pressure conditions as the second growth but using a fluence of 1.2 J/cm^{2}. The target–substrate distance was kept constant at 5.0 cm. For fluence modifications, the spot size was kept constant at 2.3 mm, and the laser output energy was varied. In Table I, the experimental conditions are summarized. The films were cut in half, and one part of each film was annealed at 500 °C in air during 90 min.
Prior each deposition, the laser produced plasma was analyzed by Langmuir probe characterization. Measurements were carried out using a 6.0 mm diameter planar Langmuir probe biased at −50 V. The probe current was obtained by measuring the voltage drop across an 18 Ω resistor; this voltage was measured using a Tektronix 500 MHz digital oscilloscope. For these measurements, the substrate was replaced by the planar probe. The plasma parameters such as mean kinetic ion energy and plasma density were estimated by the time of flight technique (TOF). The average kinetic energy of the ions, E_{k}, present in the plasma was estimated using the TOF curve data, and the procedure described in Ref [10]. The calculation uses the following relationship:
where m is the mass of the ion, L is the target to probe distance, and I(t) is the probe current as a function of time. For the plasma ion density calculation, the maximum value of the current (saturation current) was used [11]. Table I shows the plasma parameters used for the samples growth.
The films were structurally characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Rigaku Dmax2100 diffractometer and Raman spectroscopy using a Horiba Jobin Yvon HR 800 Raman spectrometer with a 532 nm excitation line. The optical characterization of the films was carried out by UV-Vis spectroscopy in a PerkinElmer Lambda 35 spectrophotometer and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy using a Dilor LabRam microspectrometer, equipped with a Si CCD detector and a 488 nm Ar^{+} laser line as excitation source.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Plasma parameters (mean kinetic ion energy and ion density) calculated from the TOF curves, obtained from Langmuir probe measurements, are shown in Fig. 2. The x axis represents the delay time, which is the time taken by the ions to reach the probe's surface, and the y axis is the calculated current. It can be noticed that the signal reaches a maximum value at some time, and this value is the ion saturation current, which is proportional to the density [11]. The higher the maximum value for the signal, the larger the ion density. For the plasma parameters calculation, the mass of vanadium was used, assuming that V ions reach the probe faster than Zn because V is lighter than Zn. Besides, according to the target composition, more V than Zn ions are expected to exist in the plasma. In the TOF curves (Fig. 2), the straight black line corresponds to sample ZVO1, which was deposited under vacuum at a fluence of 2 J/cm^{2}. Under these conditions, it is expected that scattering due to collisions in the plasma is low, producing large mean free paths, which result in a large quantity of ions with high mean kinetic energy reaching the probe. Both plasma density and energy depend on the fluence and background pressure. As it can be observed, the deposition conditions for sample ZVO1 yielded an ion energy of 114 eV with a density of 27.6 × 10^{12 }cm^{−3}. The red dashed line corresponds to sample ZVO2, which was deposited using the same fluence as ZVO1 but at a pressure of 2 × 10^{−2} mbar. Notice that the intensity decreases by an order of magnitude with respect to sample ZVO1 as a consequence of the increase in the scattering processes in the plasma due to collisions with ions in the background gas. As a result, the mean kinetic ion energy and density decreased to 69 eV and 3.5 × 10^{12 }cm^{−3}, respectively. Finally, the dotted blue line is the TOF curve for sample ZVO3, deposited at a pressure of 2 × 10^{−2} mbar with a fluence of 1.2 J/cm^{2}. In this case, the ion energy and density were calculated to be 61 eV and 0.8 × 10^{12 }cm^{−3}, respectively. Decreasing the fluence and keeping the pressure at 2 × 10^{−2} mbar induces a scattering increase in the plasma, while reducing the number of ions reaching the probe with no significant effect on their energy.
It has been shown in previous works [6,12,13] that the energy of ions in the plasma plays an important role on the structural properties of the obtained films. Thus, the aim of having two energy ranges in this study was to evaluate possible structural changes in the films, as it will be discussed later. The plasma density changed from 0.8 to 27.6 × 10^{12 }cm^{−3}.
Figure 3 shows XRD patterns of as-deposited and annealed samples. As-deposited samples are amorphous regardless of the ion energy and density. Higher surface energy on the substrate or higher kinetic energy of the ions is needed in order to grow crystalline films. The amorphous samples were annealed at 500 °C with the aim of crystallizing them and analyze the obtained structure. In the XRD patterns of the annealed samples (Fig. 3), a mixture of crystalline phases can be observed in all the films corresponding to Zn_{3}V_{2}O_{8} (PDF#340378) and α and β-Zn_{2}V_{2}O_{7}. The diffraction pattern of the sample grown with an ion energy of 114 eV and plasma density of 27.6 × 10^{12 }cm^{−3} (ZVO1-T_{a}) shows that the film was not completely crystallized as revealed by the broad band centered at approximately 27°. Along with the amorphous signal, peaks corresponding mostly to α-Zn_{2}V_{2}O_{7} (PDF#291396) can be observed. A small peak associated with β-Zn_{2}V_{2}O_{7} (PDF#191474) can also be observed, indicating that at this deposition conditions the α zinc pyrovanadate compound is favored after annealing. It is important to remember that this sample was grown under vacuum conditions (Table I). For samples grown in an oxygen atmosphere, the annealing process produced the formation of α and β-Zn_{2}V_{2}O_{7} with the inclusion of Zn_{3}V_{2}O_{8}. The diffraction pattern corresponding to sample ZVO3-T_{a} grown at energy and density of 61 eV and 0.8 × 10^{12 }cm^{−3}, respectively, differs from sample ZVO2-T_{a} in the preferred orientation of β-Zn_{2}V_{2}O_{7}, and in the presence of Zn_{3}V_{2}O_{8} indicating that the deposition conditions of sample ZVO3-T_{a} tend to form an almost pure phase of β-Zn_{2}V_{2}O_{7}, preferentially oriented in the [100] direction. As these two samples were grown at the same pressure and kinetic energy, it can be concluded that the density of the ions in the plasma plays an important role in the crystalline orientation for the low energy range. That is, the crystalline phases can be controlled by the plasma parameters during growth.
Sample ZVO1-T_{a} presents a broad band, indicating the presence of amorphous material. When comparing with films ZVO2-T_{a} and ZVO3-T_{a}, it can be concluded that the samples need to be deposited using an oxygen atmosphere in order to crystallize with postannealing treatments.
Figure 4 shows the Raman spectra of the as-deposited and the annealed samples. In the first case, the presence of vibrational modes of Zn_{2}V_{2}O_{7} and ZnV_{2}O_{6} can be observed. According to the XRD results, these samples are amorphous; nevertheless, the Raman spectra conformed by well-defined peaks reveal a short range order in these materials. The spectra corresponding to the annealed samples show intense and sharp peaks in the high frequency region (800–1000 cm^{−1}), characteristic of vanadate compounds [9,14]. It can be observed that the sample ZVO1-T_{a} has almost only vibrational features associated with Zn_{2}V_{2}O_{7} confirming the results obtained by XRD where a majority of the zinc pyrovanadate compound was found. For samples ZVO2-T_{a} and ZVO3-T_{a}, an intense peak centered at 950 cm^{−1} corresponding to ZnV_{2}O_{6} is observed [2], which reveals the presence of inclusions of the ZnV_{2}O_{6} phase, which was not observed by XRD.
UV-Vis absorption measurements were used to estimate the band gap using the Tauc relation [15]. Plots of (O.D. hν)^{2} versus hν, where O.D. is the optical density (absorption) and hν is the photon energy, are shown in Fig. 5 for the as-deposited and annealed samples. The film deposited in vacuum at high energy conditions (ZVO1) is strongly absorbent in the visible region of the spectrum; it is black colored, and it was not possible to observe any absorption edge. A similar behavior was observed previously for nonstoichiometric cadmium oxide, grown by ablating a stoichiometric CdO target [12]. This strong absorption can be associated with the presence of a high density of structural and compositional defects generated by the oxygen deficiencies in the sample, resulting from the deposition in vacuum. After annealing the ZVO1 sample, an absorption edge can be observed; thus, the band gap could be estimated, yielding a value of E_{g} = 1.73 eV, which is below the estimated band gap of bulk Zn_{2}V_{2}O_{7} (2.76 eV) at room temperature. This behavior can be due to the presence of structural defects mentioned before along with the amorphous phase still present in the film, which generates energy levels within the band gap, producing a strong optical absorption.
The Raman spectroscopy results were in agreement with the existence of short range order in the amorphous films deposited at 2 × 10^{−2} mbar in the low energy range. The band gap value of these films is approximately 500 meV higher than the estimated gap for bulk ZnV_{2}O_{6} (2.29 eV) (Fig. 5). This widening could be assumed to be originated by the presence of very small crystals so that the size effects could account for the band gap. Nevertheless, the annealed films have the band gap values of approximately 3.1 eV, while the XRD results indicate the existence of bigger crystals, which would be in conflict with the band gap widening due to size effects. An accurate and more detailed explanation for this phenomenon is needed; however, due to the lack of information about thin films of zinc vanadates, this explanation is not possible.
The photoluminescence spectra are shown in Fig. 6. A weak broad band in the infrared-visible region of the spectrum can be observed for all samples. The band corresponding to the ZVO1 film is centered at 1.95 eV, and it has a shoulder at 2.1 eV. According to the UV-Vis results, the absorption in the UV-Vis range for this sample is very high, leading to negligible light transmission producing a black-colored film to the eye. This phenomenon has also been previously observed for CdO [12], in which a broad band, associated with defects, centered near 1.9 eV, was detected. For the case of the ZVO1 sample, the band could be generated by oxygen vacancies [12].
Similar behaviors were observed in spectra of samples ZVO2 and ZVO3, with the observation that the center of the broad feature shifts to lower energies. Note that a shoulder centered at 2.3 eV appears in the spectrum of sample ZVO2, which is better defined in the spectrum of sample ZVO3. The band gap obtained by UV-Vis measurements for these samples is near to 2.8 eV; thus, the observed PL emissions correspond to transitions between energy levels within the bandgap, probably generated by the oxygen related defects, as they change with the deposition pressure.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
Films of amorphous zinc vanadates were deposited by pulsed laser deposition. The films can be crystallized in different compounds depending on the deposition pressure and thus on the plasma conditions. It was found that a mixture of α and β ZnV_{2}O_{7} and Zn_{3}V_{2}O_{6} with different proportions were obtained. The results showed that the structural and optical properties after annealing are strongly dependent on the deposition pressure, i.e., plasma density. The phase content of each material is affected mainly by the deposition pressure. The band gap of the films can be controlled by both deposition conditions and postdeposition annealing treatments.
