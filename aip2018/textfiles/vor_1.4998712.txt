High resolution thickness measurements of ultrathin Si:P monolayers using weak localization
The key building blocks for the fabrication of devices based on the deterministic placement of dopants in silicon using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) hydrogen lithography are the formation of well-defined dopant delta-layers and the overgrowth of high quality crystalline Si. To develop these capabilities, it is of critical importance to quantify dopant movement in the sub-nanometer regime. To this end, we investigate Si:P delta-layer samples produced by fully exposing a Si surface to PH_{3} prior to Si encapsulation with dramatically different levels of dopant confinement. We examine the effect of delta layer confinement on the weak localization signal in parallel and perpendicular magnetic fields and extract the delta-layer thickness from fits to the Hikami-Larkin-Nagaoka equation. We find good agreement with secondary ion mass spectroscopy measurements and demonstrate the applicability of this method in the sub-nanometer thickness regime. Our analysis serves as detailed instruction for the determination of the conducting layer thickness of a Si:P delta-layer by means of a high-throughput, nondestructive electrical transport measurement.
Atomistic patterning of phosphorus dopants on Si (100) surfaces by means of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) probe tip-based hydrogen lithography [1–4] is a promising method to produce atomic scale devices such as wires [5,6], quantum dots [7,8], and single dopant transistors [9]. Advances in this technique motivate its use as a powerful metrological tool to study the building blocks of the Si-based Kane quantum computer [10–12] and the ultimate scaling of conventional semiconductor devices [13]. Essential to the successful fabrication and study of single- or few-dopant devices is the development of a method to produce high-quality epitaxially overgrown silicon to embed [14,15] and electrically activate the phosphorus dopants [16]. Much progress has been made in improving sample synthesis methods that limit dopant diffusion and segregation of the incorporated phosphorus by limiting the thermal excursion of the overgrowth to 250 °C [17,18] and suppressing dopant segregation by growing a locking layer at room temperature prior to Si encapsulation [19].
Continued improvements in reducing device variability that arises from the movement of dopants during Si overgrowth are necessary to reproducibly fabricate devices based on the precise dopant position. This requirement lays bare a need to accurately measure phosphorus diffusion and segregation. This is most straightforwardly done by studying the thickness of Si:P delta-layers (highly confined Si:P monolayers of high dopant concentration) as a function of silicon encapsulation layer growth parameters, a measurement conventionally done by means of secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS). SIMS has the unfortunate drawback of being a destructive measurement technique that is limited in terms of spatial resolution due to, e.g., information depth limits of bombarding atoms, surface roughness, and sputter mixing [20,21]. An alternative depth profiling method with nominally higher spatial resolution is atom probe tomography (APT) [22], a technique that is highly destructive to the measured samples, suffers notoriously low measurement throughput and low atomic accuracy, and is relatively underevaluated from the perspective of repeatability and reproducibility [23].
A more unorthodox method of measuring confinement of the delta-layer dopants in these samples is via the use of magnetotransport measurements with the magnetic field applied both parallel and perpendicular to the plane of the sample at cryogenic temperatures. We report here the advancement of a non-destructive technique for measuring the thickness of embedded phosphorus delta-layers in silicon by using a study of the weak localization feature observed at low fields and low temperatures for Si:P delta-layers grown into Si from PH_{3} precursors [24]. Sullivan et_al demonstrated the effectiveness of this technique for embedded Si:P delta-layers grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) in Si with thicknesses greater than 10 nm [25], and Scappucci et_al utilized this technique for several-nm-thick Ge:P delta-layers grown into Ge from PH_{3} precursors [26]. This technique does not specifically measure depth-profiled ion core density of P in Si:P systems as SIMS and APT do but rather measures the thickness of the region in which charge carriers undergo conductive transport. This entails a notable difference in measured length scales due to charge shielding and parameters related to doping density, ordering, separation, and activation. It is, however, a decidedly useful way to measure dopant confinement as it pertains to the function of the Si:P source and drain terminals, side gates, and single electron transistor islands that, furthermore, distinguishes active and inactive P dopants (SIMS does not). Moreover, because the active P dopants contribute to the Coulomb potential that confines the charge carriers in the delta-layer, we are able to relate the magnetotransport-measured conducting layer thickness to the distribution of the activated P atoms in the delta-layer. Magnetotransport measurements offer the compelling advantage of overcoming the resolution limits of SIMS. For example, using magnetotransport, Mensz and Wheeler measured a conducting layer thickness of 0.21 ± 0.015 nm in Si inversion layers in a Si MOSFET [27].
We compare results for samples with dramatically different levels of dopant confinement, grown with and without a 15 monolayer (ML, 1 ML ≈ 0.1358 nm) Si locking layer deposited at room temperature prior to Si encapsulation. Our careful analysis shows that weak localization signals in perpendicular and parallel magnetic fields offer a sensitive probe of delta layer thickness that serves as a complementary tool to SIMS that overcomes its resolution limitations, which we discuss in this paper for Si:P delta-layers. We demonstrate the applicability of this method in the sub-nanometer thickness regime.
Sample synthesis followed the methodology in previous work by Deng et_al [28] Two samples were fabricated with a phosphorus delta layer produced in ultra-high vacuum by exposing a clean Si (100) surface to a saturation dosing of PH_{3} at room temperature followed by heating the sample at 384 ± 24 °C for 2 min to incorporate P into the Si surface. The phosphorus delta layer is encapsulated by overgrown epitaxial Si using a sublimated Si source. A 15 ML Si locking layer was deposited at room temperature prior to encapsulation on one of the samples; no locking layer was deposited on the other sample. For this study, we aimed to have the largest contrast in conducting layer thickness between a non-locking layer sample and the locking layer sample. The locking layer growth process used in this study was chosen for the following reasons. 1.8 ML/min deposition rate for the locking layer is the highest rate we have investigated, and because the degree of confinement is determined by the deposition rate [29], we deem that a locking layer deposition process with a deposition rate of 1.8 ML/min achieves our best confinement process. The 15 ML locking layer thickness was chosen as this was observed to be of sufficient thickness to prevent substantial dopant movement into the overgrown Si layer during the encapsulation process. Both samples were then held at 274 ± 17 °C for 17 min prior to the epitaxial overgrowth of a Si encapsulation layer at 274 ± 17 °C for ≥140 min, producing an approximately 30 nm Si encapsulation layer. Growth parameter details are illustrated in Fig. 1.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images for both samples [Figs. 2(a) and 2(b)] reveal remarkably high quality epitaxial overgrowth of the encapsulating Si. The sample grown with a 15 ML locking layer shows a pronounced interface contrast near the delta layer in the TEM image that is absent in the sample grown without a locking layer, indicating a change in the interface arising from the deposition of 15 ML of Si at room temperature. We attribute this change to an increase in the introduction of defects at this interface due to the room-temperature growth. This is supported by electrical transport data showing a lower mobility for the locking layer sample (Table I), which suggests increased scattering due to interfacial impurities. Furthermore, the reduced carrier concentration in this sample relative to the SIMS-measured P concentration of 1.92 ± 0.19 × 10^{14} cm^{−2} suggests that fewer P atoms were electrically activated due the poorer crystal quality at this interface compared to the no locking layer sample, where the carrier concentration was in much closer agreement to the SIMS-measured P concentration of 1.94 ± 0.19 × 10^{14} cm^{−2}. A study by Keizer et_al reveals a method by which the dopant activation rate can be improved in Si:P delta-layers confined by a locking layer by minimizing the formation of deactivating defects [29].
The areal density of P versus sample depth as measured by SIMS [Fig. 2(c)] for both samples shows that the locking layer considerably improves the confinement of P to the delta layer. Moreover, without the locking layer, P appears to segregate and/or diffuse through the entire thickness of the encapsulation layer. A detailed method by which we quantify and differentiate mechanisms for dopant movement in Si:P atomic devices during Si encapsulation is presented elsewhere [30]. For the purpose of this paper, to report approximate SIMS-measured delta-layer thicknesses to which to compare magnetotransport measured delta-layer thickness values, we determine the conducting layer thicknesses of each sample by means of the following simple deconvolution of the SIMS signal. Diffusion experiments and calculations show virtually no diffusion of P into the substrate during the overgrowth of either the locking layer or the silicon encapsulation layer [31]. We therefore assume that the P density measured in the region of the delta layer at depths below the position of peak P density [0 ML in Fig. 2(c)] is due to sputter mixing during ion bombardment; we disregard this region of the SIMS profile and only assume that the layers of the sample contributing to charge conduction are those monolayers above the position of peak P density with P concentration above the degenerate level of about 3 × 10^{18} cm^{−3}. By this analysis of the SIMS profile for each sample, we measure delta-layer thicknesses of approximately 30 nm for the no locking layer sample (approximately the thickness of the entire overgrown Si layer) and 3 nm for the locking layer sample (Table I). While a delta-layer thickness measurement of 3 nm for the locking layer sample is a promising indication that the P is highly confined to the delta layer, we lay out in the following paragraph a perspective on the limitation of SIMS to resolve the thickness of the delta-layers in these Si:P samples.
A measure of SIMS spatial resolution limits can be deduced by examining the decay lengths of highly optimized SIMS measurements. One of the best decay lengths ever achieved, 0.83 nm per decade of dopant density, was reported by Juhel et_al for B in Si under O bombardment [32]. Good results for SIMS measurements of dopant density depth profiling in Si under Cs bombardment of 1 nm/decade–2 nm/decade have been reported for As dopants in Si [33,34]. For the reason that Cs is the required bombarding atom for Si:P profiling, we can set an approximate lower bound on the decay lengths of our SIMS-measured P density profile at about 1 nm/decade. For the Si:P delta-layer in the locking layer sample, which has a peak P concentration of 7.65 × 10^{20} cm^{−3}, a 1 nm/decade decay length—just about the best case scenario—would limit the ability of SIMS to accurately resolve a spread of the delta-layer of less than 2.5 nm on the leading SIMS profile edge for the delta-layer (sputter mixing adds additional uncertainty to ascertaining dopant spread on the back end of the delta-layer profile). This limitation motivates our use of magnetotransport measurements to ascertain the delta-layer thickness with improved sensitivity to complement SIMS measurements.
Electrical measurements were performed on Si:P samples etched into a Hall bar geometry with channel lengths of 500 μm and channel widths of 50 μm by using standard lithographic techniques. Samples were affixed to the end of an insert rod and loaded into a continuous closed-cycle cryostat with a superconducting magnet (maximum field of 12 T). With an approximately 1 μA current applied along the channel and longitudinal and transverse (Hall) voltages measured simultaneously, magnetoresistance measurements were taken at temperatures ranging from a base temperature of 2 K to 10 K, with magnetic fields swept from −3 T to +3 T applied both perpendicular (B_{⊥}) and parallel (B_{ǁ}) to the planes of the samples. Temperatures were measured by a thermocouple positioned near to the sample. Parameters associated with electrical transport extracted from measurements at base temperature are given in Table I. The sample two-dimensional carrier density, n_{2D}, and the mobility, μ, were determined by standard evaluation of the B-dependent Hall resistivity. From these parameters, we calculate the mean scattering time, τ=μme, where m is the effective mass. Conductivity in this system is assumed to be dominated by electrons in the lowest energy subband, with effective mass, m = 0.19 m_{e}, where m_{e} is the free electron mass [35]; this theoretically derived effective mass value is in good agreement with one measured by Miwa et_al using direct spectroscopic measurements and density functional theory calculations for a similar system [36]. The diffusion coefficient is calculated as D=vF2τ/2, where v_{F} is the Fermi velocity of carriers in a two-dimensional electron gas, v_{F}=ℏmk_{F}. The Fermi wavelength, k_{F}, is solved for the 2D density of states (DOS) for Si, k_{F}=4πn2Dgsgv{12}, where g_{s} and g_{v} are the spin degeneracy and the valley degeneracy, respectively. Here, for a two-dimensional electron gas with Si (001) orientation, we assume g_{s} = 2 and g_{v} = 2. The calculated values of k_{F} = 0.15 Å^{−1} and k_{F} = 0.24 Å^{−1} for the locking layer sample and no-locking layer sample, respectively, are in reasonably good agreement with k_{F} = 0.1 Å^{−1} as measured by Miwa et_al for a similar Si:P delta layer system [36]. The mean free path, l, is calculated per the equations l=2Dτ.
A two-dimensional electron gas at temperatures low enough to maintain phase coherence over many scattering events will support self-intersecting closed electron paths that, due to the Aharonov-Bohm interference between these paths, leads to a higher probability of localization [37]. This quantum effect, known as weak localization (WL), leads to an increase in sample resistivity and a corresponding decrease in the sample conductivity at zero magnetic field, B = 0 T, given by
where τ_{ϕ} is the dephasing time.
When |B| > 0, the conductivity of the sample increases with increasing |B| as the increasing magnetic flux through these self-intersecting closed electron paths changes the phase of the two paths, reducing the WL signal. The WL signal, therefore, depends on the temperature and both the magnitude and direction of B. When a non-zero B is perpendicular to the delta layer (B_{⊥}), the change in conductance due to weak localization in the two-dimensional conducting layer for a Si:P system with weak spin and spin-orbit scattering with B_{⊥} is given by the Hikami-Larkin-Nagaoka equation [38]
where Ψ is the digamma function. Fitting the data to Eq. (2) gives τ_{ϕ}, from which we calculate the phase coherence length, l_{ϕ}=Dτ_{ϕ}. The ratio of l_{ϕ}/l gives approximate values for the average number of scattering events leading to dephasing at B = 0 and T = 2 K. The no locking layer sample and the locking layer sample give l_{ϕ}/l ratios of 9.4 and 12.3, respectively. In the Si:P delta layer system, where the delta layer thickness is derived from the distribution in the positions of individual P dopants as a result of the processing, the correlation length, l_{c} (a measure of surface roughness), is equivalent to the mean donor spacing, l_{c}=1/n_{2D}, which is on the order of ∼1 nm, in good agreement with a study by Lee et_al [39] In this system, where l_{c}≪l≪l_{ϕ}, when the magnetic field is parallel to the delta layer (B_{ǁ}), the field enhances the dephasing rate, as ττ_{ϕ}→ττ_{ϕ}+ττ_{||}, where ττ_{||}≅4πe^{2}ℏ^{2}l_{c}llϕ2Δ^{2}B_{||} [40]. Inserting this into Eq. (1) leads to the homogenous broadening of the weak-localization line per the equation
where Δ is the root-mean-square thickness fluctuations of the delta layer or the average delta layer thickness.
The experimentally observed change in conductivity due to WL as a function of magnetic field was calculated as δσ_{WL}B−δσ_{WL}B=0=σB−σ0. For the purposes of this study, we ignore the parabolic contribution to the magnetoresistance typically attributed to electron-electron (e-e) interactions. The contribution to the conductivity tensor from e-e scattering in the Si:P system studied here is small, as it is in the diffusive regime, Tτ≪kB/ℏ{−1}, and in weak magnetic fields, ω_{c}τ≪1, where cyclotron frequency ω_{c} = eB/m [41,42]. Fits to Eqs. (2) and (3) are shown for both samples in Fig. 3. Using parameters derived from the equations, we calculate the root mean square thickness, Δ, for both devices at base temperature (Table I). Δ derived from the analysis of the WL signal is about 24 nm and 0.8 nm for the no locking layer sample and the locking layer sample, respectively. The WL-derived values are in good agreement with the respective 30 nm and 3 nm thicknesses derived from SIMS, and the measured thickness of the well-confined delta layer of about 0.8 nm agrees well with the approximately 0.40 nm to 0.52 nm full-width-half-max of the Lorentzian envelope of a modeled single highly doped Si:P monolayer in Si [43].
We examine the dephasing effect of temperature on the conducting channels by plotting l_{ϕ} as a function of temperature for both samples, shown in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b). The fit to the power law equation is shown, with uncertainty given as the one-sigma fitting error. The divergence from the power law temperature dependence for l_{ϕ} at 2 K suggests that the experimental measurement setup is insufficient to cool the electron temperature to the thermocouple-measured temperature value at base temperature. The profile of the WL magnetoconductivity signature at different temperatures is shown in the insets. The locking layer sample shows a power law temperature dependence for l_{ϕ} of approximately T^{−0.51 ± 0.01}, a temperature dependence very close to the expected T^{−1/2} due to e-e scattering in a 2D disordered conducting system [44]. The no locking layer sample shows a power law temperature dependence for l_{ϕ} of approximately T^{−0.71 ± 0.02}, which is very close to the expected T^{−3/4} temperature dependence of l_{ϕ} due to large energy transfer e-e scattering interactions typically observed in 3D disordered conducting systems [44]. It should be noted that while we ignore the e-e interactions in regard to the conductivity tensor, e-e interactions have a more notable effect on phase coherence as τ_{ϕ}≫τ and Tτ_{ϕ} is on the order of kB/ℏ{−1}.
The sample thickness of the no locking layer sample, which is much larger than the Fermi wavelength, λ_{F}, of 2.6 nm, and the temperature dependence of l_{ϕ} suggestive of e-e scattering interactions in a 3D disordered system imply that this system may not be a purely 2D one. Our analysis largely relies on the assumption of a 2D system, specifically in the density of states calculations that give v_{F} and D, the mean donor spacing, l_{c}, as well as in the application of Eq. (2). To explore the question of dimensionality, we calculate Δ per the previously described methodology while assuming a 3D density of states, where k_{F}=6π2n3Dgsgv{13}, n_{3D} is the carrier volume density calculated as n_{3D} = n_{2D}/Δ, where Δ is self-consistent with the WL-derived Δ value, g_{v} = 6, and l_{c}=1/n_{3D}3. This calculation gives Δ = 9.2 nm, which does not agree with the SIMS-measured value of 30 nm nor our WL-determined value of 24 nm. This suggests that taking the above measures to partially treat the system as 3D, even in the case where Δ≫λ_{F}, produces inaccurate results. Furthermore, in the systems studied here, l_{ϕ}≫Δ, which means that the z-component to the scattering contributes minimally to the overall path length of the self-intersecting closed electron paths and that the delta layer thickness does not suggest a significant deviation from WL in a 2D system. We thus determine that the treatment of transport through P delta layers embedded in Si as 2D is appropriate for deriving delta layer thickness via analysis of the WL signal at low temperatures. Moreover, we note the application of the 2D framework is preferable for consistency of analysis.
We have shown that analysis of the weak localization signal in magnetoconductance measurements represents an effective metrological technique by which we ascertain the thickness of the delta layer beyond the depth resolution of traditional SIMS measurements. We show that magnetotransport measurements provide a useful determination of the quality of the confinement of P delta layers in Si and provide detailed instructions for the determination of the conducting layer thickness of a Si:P delta-layer. Comparison of our results to findings based on SIMS shows good agreement. This procedure serves as an efficient method to study and quantify phosphorus dopant movement at atomic scales by means of a high-throughput, nondestructive electrical transport measurement, which provides essential fabrication guidance toward increasing the reproducibility of single and few dopant devices in Si. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of this method for Si:P delta-layers in the sub-nanometer thickness regime. In principle, a modified version of this measurement, whereby the magnetoresistance is measured at low temperatures with a magnetic field applied parallel to the sample plane, swept between ±1 T, can serve as a qualitative screen for adequate dopant confinement in real world samples if no weak localization signal is observed.
