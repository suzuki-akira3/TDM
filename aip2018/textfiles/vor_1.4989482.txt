First-principles study of native defects in bulk Sm_{2}CuO_{4} and its (001) surface structure
Using the first-principles calculations based on the density functional theory, we have studied the bulk defect formation and surface structures of Sm_{2}CuO_{4}. To ensure the accuracy of calculations, the spin order of Cu atoms is rechecked and it is the well-known nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic ground state, which can be attributed to the hole-mediated superexchange through the strong pdσ hybridization interaction between Cu d_{x2-y2} electron and the neighboring oxygen p_{x} (or p_{y}) electron. Under each present experimental condition, the Sm vacancy has a very high formation energy and is unlikely to be stable. The Cu vacancy is a shallow acceptor, which is preferred under O-rich conditions, whereas the O vacancy is a donor and energetically favorable under O-poor conditions. To construct its (001) surface structure, CuOO, CuO, and Cu terminated surfaces are found to be most favorable under different experimental conditions. The stable surface structures are always accompanied by significant surface atomic reconstructions and electron charge redistribution, which are intimately correlated to each other.
I. INTRODUCTION
The lanthanide copper oxides of a general formula RE_{2}CuO_{4} (Refs [1–10]) (RE =La, Pr, Nd, Eu, Sm, and Gd) have been extensively studied due to the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in 1986. The non-stoichiometric cuprates contain CuO_{2} planes as common elements, where a simple antiferromagnetic (AFM) configuration with the Cu moments align antiparallel in the plane [11–18]. Systematic studies of the electronic and magnetic properties, as well as the defect physics in cuprates shall be beneficial to understand the physics nature of d-wave superconductors.
Within a decade, a high mobility two-dimensional electron gas, magnetism, and superconductivity have been observed in the band-insulator-formed SrTiO_{3}/LaAlO_{3} interface [19–23]. Different from the SrTiO_{3} and LaAlO_{3}, Sm_{2}CuO_{4} is a n-type Mott insulator with a charge-transfer gap [24]. It is much more interesting to observe the depletion layer in p‐N junctions and the conduction-band offset in the n‐N junctions through photocurrent action spectra in Sm_{2}CuO_{4}/Nd:SrTiO_{3} [25,26]. Furthermore, Bruno et_al [24] have grown LaFeO_{3}/Sm_{2}CuO_{4} superlattices on TiO_{2} terminated (001) SrTiO_{3} substrates in a high-pressure pure oxygen sputtering system. Their transport measurements provide evidence of a metallic state at the interface between two nominally Mott-insulating materials. For understanding the novel interfacial metallic behavior on LaFeO_{3}/Sm_{2}CuO_{4} superlattices, a realistic theoretical model for interfaces related to Sm_{2}CuO_{4} and investigations of surface termination on bulk Sm_{2}CuO_{4} are greatly desired. However, to our best knowledge, the theoretical study on the surface properties of Sm_{2}CuO_{4} is still lacking.
In this paper, using first-principles calculation methods, we firstly study the magnetic ground states of Sm_{2}CuO_{4} compound, and the long-range AFM order of Sm atoms is not considered here. In good agreement with experiments, we find that the Cu magnetic moments are ordered antiferromagnetically (G-type AFM order), which is induced by the hole-mediated superexchange between Cu and neighboring O atoms. We also comprehensively examine the native defects and antisite defects in bulk Sm_{2}CuO_{4} compounds. We find that the V_{cu} is energetically favorable under O-rich conditions, whereas under O-poor conditions, the Sm_{Cu} and V_{O2} are relatively easy to achieve in experiments because of their lower defect formation energies. Besides the neutral defects, we also considered formation energies of the defects in various charged states under different experimental conditions. V_{Cu} have the lowest formation energies over the whole range of Fermi level, indicating that V_{Cu} is easily formed under O-rich atmosphere. Under O-poor condition, the formation energies of V_{O2} are negative and much lower than other vacancies over the whole range of Fermi level, resulting in spontaneous formations. V_{Cu}, V_{Sm}, and Cu_{sm} have very high formation energies and are not energetically favorable under O-poor condition. Moreover, we investigate the (001) surface properties of Sm_{2}CuO_{4} to determine the stable surface terminations. Through fully relaxing atomic positions, we find that significant surface atomic reconstruction and electron charge redistribution occur simultaneously.
II. COMPUTATIONAL METHODS
All the calculations were carried out using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [27,28] based on density-functional theory (DFT) with the projector augmented wave (PAW) method. Generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional was adopted to describe the exchange-correlation interaction. To account for the correlation energy of Cu 3d orbitals, we employed a Hubbard term within the functional (GGA + U) [29,30]. The values of on-site Coulomb U and exchange J parameters are set to be 8 and 0.88 eV, respectively, which were used in previous calculations [31,32]. The valence electrons for the Sm, Cu, and O atoms are 11 (Sm: 5s^{2}6s^{2}5p^{6}5d^{1}), 11 (Cu: 3d^{10}4s^{1}), and 6 (O: 2s^{2}2p^{4}). The kinetic energy cutoff of 500 eV for the plane wave basis was used. Following the Monkhorst-Pack scheme, the Brillouin-zone of the 56-atom supercell was sampled 6 × 6 × 4 k-points grid to obtain the total energies; in the case of surface structures, 12 × 12 × 1 k-points grid was used for the geometry optimization and total energy calculations. The symmetry unrestricted atomic position optimization (as well as lattice constant) was performed using the conjugate gradient scheme until the Hellman–Feynman force was smaller than 10^{−2 }eV/Å in all the calculations. For the charged defects, it is necessary to align the electrostatic potential in the perfect bulk and defect supercells and to account for finite-cell size effects on the total energies of charged defects. In our work, we have adopted the supercell corrections for charged defects by Freysoldt et_al [33,34], which comprises a rigorous treatment of the electrostatic problem.
The defect charge-state transition level ε(q/q′) is defined as the Fermi-level position below which the defect is stable in the charge state q and above which the defect is stable in charge state q′. The defect charge-state transition level is calculated as [37–42]
where E_{f} (D, q; E_{F} = 0) is the defect formation energy for charge state q when E_{F} is at the valence band maximum (VBM). The position of the transition level in the band gap does not depend on the chemical potential.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Magnetic structure and electronic properties of bulk Sm_{2}CuO_{4}
For ensuring the accuracy of our density functional theory calculations, we rechecked the atomic, electronic, and magnetic structure of the bulk Sm_{2}CuO_{4}. The Sm_{2}CuO_{4} compound adopts a tetragonal I4/mmm (T′-phase) structure, the same as Nd_{2}CuO_{4} and Pr_{2}CuO_{4} [2–8]. For investigating the magnetic properties of the Sm_{2}CuO_{4} crystal, we chose a 2 × 2 × 1 supercell containing 32 O, 8 Cu, and 16 Sm atoms, as shown in Fig. 1(a). We use O1(O2) to represent the O atoms in CuO(OO) layer. The optimized lattice constant of the supercell Sm_{2}CuO_{4}, i.e., a = 7.872 Å and c = 12.061 Å, which agrees well with the previous study [15–18].
First, we discuss the magnetic properties for the Cu spins in Sm_{2}CuO_{4}. As shown in Figs. 1(b)–1(e), we consider four magnetic configurations in the supercell: (b) FM coupling (both intra-plane and inter-plane coupling are ferromagnetic); (c) A-AFM coupling (the intra-plane coupling is ferromagnetic while inter-plane coupling is antiferromagnetic); (d) C-AFM coupling (the intra-chain coupling is ferromagnetic, while inter-chain coupling is antiferromagnetic); and (e) G-AFM (the nearest-neighbor coupling is antiferromagnetic in a plane). Since the supercell sizes and the numbers of each type of atoms are the same, we can simply compare the total energy of these different magnetic spin configurations. Table I lists relative total energy of the Sm_{2}CuO_{4} in different magnetic configurations with respect to G-AFM. We can observe the G-AFM order is energetically favorable, and the energy is lower than the A-AFM, FM, C-AFM, and NM (nonmagnetic) configurations about 1.33, 1.33, 0.56, and 2.62 eV, respectively. This indicates that the G-AFM should be the ground state of Sm_{2}CuO_{4}, which is agreement with the experimental observations [15,16]. Especially, the energies of the A-AFM and FM are degenerate as the distance between Cu spins layer is too large, and the inter-plane interaction between Cu spins layer can be ignored.
To further illustrate the origin of the G-AFM magnetic order, the calculated total and partial density of states (DOS) and the band structure, are presented in Figs. 2(a)–2(h) and 3. The total density of states (DOS) are shown in Fig. 2(a), and the Sm_{2}CuO_{4} is an insulator with band gap of about 1.25 eV, which is also consistent with the previous results [24–26]. The spin resolved DOS are totally symmetric and the energy gap is located around the Fermi level (E_{F}), and both the valence band maximum (VBM) and the conduction band minimum (CBM) have O 2p and Cu 3d character, respectively, which is consistent with the band structure as shown in Fig. 3. The band structure calculation also reveals that the Sm_{2}CuO_{4} have a direct band gap with the VBM and CBM both located at the Γ point, and the band gap is about 1.25 eV. It is also clear from these calculations that the Cu-d_{x2-y2} and O-p bonding band is located at 7.5 eV below the Fermi level, and the corresponding antibonding band is at 1–2.5 eV above the Fermi level.
As shown in Fig. 1(a), Cu ions in Sm_{2}CuO_{4} form a square planar coordination, and thus the fivefold degenerate atomic d levels split into a lower doublet (d_{xz} and d_{yz}) and three upper nondegenerate orbitals with E_{dxy} < E_{d3z2-r2}< E_{dx2-y2}. The order of energy levels is the same as the one for the splitting of d levels due to a tetragonal elongation distortion of octahedral. As shown in Figs. 2(c), 2(d), 2(g), and 2(h), the partial DOS of Cu1 and Cu2 atoms, two Cu atoms separated by an O1 atom along y-direction [in Fig. 1(a)], are totally symmetric because of G-AFM order, and shows that there exists a hole state (d_{x2-y2}), located about 2 eV above the Fermi level, only for one spin channel. Namely, only one d_{x2-y2} hole with either up or down spin resides at Cu ions, resulting in a total magnetic moment of 0.65μ_{B} per Cu atom. More importantly, there exists a nonzero p_{x} (p_{y}) hole state at the O ion between the neighboring Cu ions along the x (y) direction. For the Cu^{2+}(d^{9})-O-Cu^{2+}(d^{9}), there is a p-d hybridization between the p_{y} (or p_{x}) and d_{x2-y2} orbital. Our band structure calculations in Fig. 3 find that the bonding p-dσ band is at 7.5 eV below Fermi level and the antibonding p-dσ band at 1–2.5 eV above Fermi level. As indicated in Fig. 3, the partial charge densities for these bonding and antibonding bands have strong characters of Cu-d_{x2-y2} and O1–p_{x,y} The lobes of d_{x2-y2} orbital and the p_{y} (or p_{y}) orbital are directed toward each other, which gives rise to a strong p-dσ hybridization. Therefore, the G-AFM order is caused by the hole-mediated superexchange through the p-dσ hybridization between Cu and neighboring O atoms.
B. Formation energies of native defects in bulk Sm_{2}CuO_{4}
We also chose the 2 × 2 × 1 supercell, as shown in Fig. 1(a), for the simulation of native defects, i.e., Sm vacancy (V_{Sm}), Cu vacancy (V_{Cu}), and O vacancy in different sites (V_{O1} and V_{O2}) . The Sm antisite defect Sm_{Cu} occurs when the occupation of a Cu site in the lattice is replaced by a Sm atom and the Cu antisite defect Cu_{Sm.} is the counterpart of the antisite defect Sm_{Cu}.
The formation energy of a neutral defect or impurity is estimated as
where E_{tot}(D) is the total energy of the supercell with impurity or defect, E_{tot}(perfect) is total energy of the supercell Sm_{2}CuO_{4} without any impurity or defect [38].n(i) indicates the number of atoms that are added to (n(i) > 0) or removed from (n(i) < 0) the perfect supercell for atomic species i, and u(i) is the atomic chemical potential. Given the host material being ternary compound, the formation energy depends on the atomic chemical potential u(i). In Sm_{2}CuO_{4}, the limit of u is determined from the equilibrium conditions with various phase containing Sm, Cu, and O. The chemical potentials of these three elements satisfy the following relation: 2μ(Sm)+μ(Cu)+4μ(O) = μ(Sm_{2}CuO_{4})_{bulk}, where μ(Sm_{2}CuO_{4})_{bulk} is the chemical potential of perfect Sm_{2}CuO_{4} crystal. There are nine equilibrium conditions given as:
We chose Sm (R3m), Cu (Fm3¯m), CuO (Cc), CuO_{2} (Pn3¯m), Sm_{2}O_{3} (C2/m), Sm_{2}CuO_{4} (I4/mmm), and O_{2} molecule as reference to evaluate the chemical potentials (or total energy) μ(Sm)_{bulk}, μ(Cu)_{bulk}, μ(CuO)_{bulk}, μ(Cu_{2}O)_{bulk}, μ(Sm_{2}O_{3})_{bulk}, μ(Sm_{2}CuO_{4})_{bulk}, and μ(O_{2})_{molecule}, respectively.
As shown in Fig. 1(a), there are two different kinds of O atoms, one class of O atoms are in the same layer of Cu atoms and located in the middle of Cu atoms (denoted as O1), and the other class of O atoms are located between the Cu layers (denoted as O2). The total energy of V_{O1} is 0.22 eV larger than that of V_{O2}, which means that an O vacancy is easily introduced in O2 site. Therefore, we consider only V_{O2} for O vacancy. The formation energies of defects V_{Sm}, V_{Cu}, V_{O2}, Sm_{Cu}, and Cu_{Sm} under nine different equilibrium conditions are summarized in Fig. 4. The formation energy of V_{Sm} is found to be relatively high as compared to other defects under all conditions, and increases from 4.23 eV (condition 1, O-rich limit) to 12.79 eV (condition 9, O-poor limit), indicating that V_{Sm} is relatively difficult to achieve in experiments. The formation energy of Cu_{sm} has almost the same tendency as that of V_{Sm}; it increases from 0.95 eV (condition 2) to 8.20 eV (condition 7). The formation energy of Sm_{cu} decreases from 3.08 eV (condition 1) to −4.16 eV (condition 7). In particular, the formation energy of V_{O2} (or V_{cu}) decreases (or increases) as the O chemical potential reducing from condition 1 to condition 9. Going toward O-rich limit conditions (1–2), the formation energy of V_{cu} is lower than those of other defect structures, which suggests that the Cu vacancy is easily formed under O-rich atmosphere. The formation energy of V_{O2} decreases and becomes much lower than others under O-poor condition (8–9). Under condition 7, the Sm_{Cu} is more stable than other defect structures.
In synthesizing Sm_{2}CuO_{4} experimentally, pure samples without defects are usually desired. However, according to our calculations, the formation energy of Sm_{Cu} (or V_{O2}) under condition 7 (or conditions 8–9) is predicted to be about −4.16 eV (or −2.06 and −2.12 eV) lower than other defects, and thus it is relatively easy to introduce these defects in experiments. To avoid this, the synthesis in experiments should not be performed in O-poor condition (like conditions 7–9). Since the samples are often baked in a stream of oxygen or in aircondition [35,36] (O-rich condition), this is much favorable for synthesizing pure samples.
Besides neutral defects, charge defects can also generate, depending on the growth condition and thermal processes. Therefore, we also study the formation energies of the defects in various charged states. In this case, the formation energy is estimated as [37–42]
In this expression, E_{tot}(D, q) is the total energy of the supercell with impurity or defect in charged state q, E_{F} is the Fermi level, referenced to the valance band maximum E_{V} of bulk Sm_{2}CuO_{4}. Finally, the term Δ^{q} is the charge-state dependent correction due to the finite size of the supercell [33,34].
We study the formation energies of charged defects as a function of the Fermi-level as shown in Fig. 5. The slope of a line corresponds to a charge defect state and the change in slope indicates a transition between charged states. The chemical environment at condition 1(O-rich limit) and condition 9 (O-poor limit) is focused in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b). The cation vacancies (V_{Cu}, V_{Sm}, and Cu_{sm}) prefer neutral states above the top of VBM and negatively charged states are stable as the Fermi-level increase. The formation energies of cation vacancies decrease as the Fermi level increases. On the contrary, the anion vacancies (V_{O2} and Cu_{sm}) positively charged states are stable over the whole range of Fermi level and the formation energies increase as the Fermi level increases. In Fig. 5(a), V_{Cu} have the lowest formation energies over the whole range of Fermi level, which suggests that V_{Cu} is easily formed under O-rich atmosphere. The transition level of V_{Cu} is close to the VBM, ε(0/1−) = 0.37 eV, indicating that V_{Cu} is a deep acceptor. The formation energies of V_{Cu} with 1− state decreases with increasing Fermi-level, including that V_{Cu} is a likely source of donor compensation.
Under condition 9 (O-poor limit), the formation energies of all charged states defect have similar trend as those under condition 1 (O-rich limit), but the formation energies have different order. In Fig. 5(b), the formation energies of V_{O2} are negative and very lower than other vacancies over the whole range of Fermi level, resulting in spontaneous formations. It shows that the 2+ charge state is the dominant defect above the top of VBM, and its energy increases as the Fermi level increases. At the bottom of conduction band (E_{F} > 0.66 eV), the 1+ charge state becomes stable, and the ε(2+/1+) = 0.66 eV. As a result, n-type Sm_{2}CuO_{4} is preferable under O-poor conditions. For Sm_{cu}, no transition level is found and the 1+ charge state is energetically favorable for the whole range of the Fermi level. On the other hand, V_{Cu}, V_{Sm}, and Cu_{sm} have very high formation energies and are hence quite unstable.
C. Ideally terminated Sm_{2}CuO_{4} (001) surface
Understanding the surface atomic and electronic structures of composite materials is prerequisite for understanding transition-metal-oxide heterostructures such as SrTiO_{3}/LaAlO_{3} [19–23], where even the robust ferromagnetic state can be induced by Al-vacancies in the LaAlO_{3} layer and the O-vacancies in SrTiO_{3} or in the LaAlO_{3} layer [43–45]. Studying the surface properties of Sm_{2}CuO_{4} is also essential to understand the interface properties of Sm_{2}CuO_{4}/Nd:SrTiO_{3} and LaFeO_{3}/Sm_{2}CuO_{4}.
We chose the 1 × 1 simulation cell in plane (x-y plane), and we consider the unit cell of Sm_{2}CuO_{4} with seven different slab structures as shown in Figs. 6(a)–6(g). The Sm_{2}CuO_{4} (100) surface may be terminated with Sm atomic layer, two O atomic layer, one O atomic layer, or one Cu atomic and two O atomic layer (labeled as –Sm1, –Sm2, –OO, –O, and –CuOO, respectively). As shown in Figs. 6(e) and 6(f), we also consider the -CuOO layer with one O atom vacancy and two O atoms vacancies layers (labeled as –CuO and –Cu, respectively). The central CuOO layer is labeled as L-0 locating at 0-th layer, and the –Sm1, –OO, –O, –Sm2 –CuOO, –CuO, and –Cu surface layers are located at L-11, L-10, L-10, L-9, L-8, L-8, and L-8, respectively. A vacuum region of 15 Å is set to avoid interactions between two slabs. All the slabs possess a mirror symmetry about L-0, and thus the surfaces on both sides of the slab are equivalent.
To compare the stability of the different seven surfaces, the surface energies (E_{s}) should be calculated [46]. The surface energy is evaluated as
where the E(slab) refers to the total energy of the slab supercell, n(O), n(Sm), and n(Cu) are number of O, Sm, and Cu atoms in the slab, and μ(O), μ(Sm), and μ(Cu) are the chemical potential of O, Sm, and Cu atoms. As previously described in Sec. III B, the chemical potentials of the three elements satisfy the following relationships: 2μ(Sm)+μ(Cu)+4μ(O) = μ(Sm_{2}CuO_{4})_{bulk} and with nine equilibrium conditions.
The calculated surface energies of Sm_{2}CuO_{4} under different conditions are shown in Fig. 7. The surface energies of –OO and –CuOO increase from 6.39 J m^{−2} (O-rich condition 1) to 18.45 J m^{−2} (O-poor condition 7) and from 1.57 J m^{−2} (O-rich condition 2) to 9.66 J m^{−2} (O-poor condition 9), respectively. The surface energies of −CuO and −Cu decrease from 3.32 J m^{−2} (condition 1) to −2.92 J m^{−2} (condition 7) and form 10.27 J m^{−2} (condition 1) to −7.57 J m^{−2} (condition 7), respectively. We can see that the surface energies of -Sm1 decrease from 5.91 J m^{−2} (condition 2) to −2.19 J m^{−2} (condition 9), and the energies of -Sm2 decrease from 11.20 J m^{−2} (condition 1) to −0.86 J m^{−2} (condition 7) It should also be noticed that the surface energies of -O are always the same under different conditions with the surface energies 3.59 J m^{−2}. This is because the surface structure of -O is composed of 10 Sm, 5 Cu and 20 O atoms, and thus satisfies the stoichiometry of Sm, Cu, and O being 2:1:4 as in bulk Sm_{2}CuO_{4}.
From condition 1 to condition 6, the surface energies of –CuOO and –CuO are lower than those of other surface states. However, under conditions 7 and 8 (O-poor), the –Cu surface energy (−7.57 J m^{−2}) is the lowest, indicating that under O-poor conditions 7 and 8, the -Cu surface, i.e., the surface terminated at the -CuOO layer with both O atoms removed, is the most stable. Under condition 9, -Sm1 surface has the lowest surface energy. From condition 1 (O-rich) to condition 9 (O-poor), the most stable surfaces are −CuOO, −CuO, −Cu, and −Sm1 surfaces, respectively. And the O atoms vacancies are easily created under O-poor condition.
Since the samples are usually synthesized under O-rich condition, we now discuss the surfaces under O-rich condition. Under conditions 1 and 2 (O-rich), the order of the surface energies is –Sm2 > –Cu > –OO > –Sm1 > –O > –CuO > –CuOO. Therefore, under O-rich condition, the –CuOO surface without any O vacancy is most likely, which corresponds to perfect heterostructures without defects in experiments [24–26].
We also examined the atomic position relaxation around the surface. We firstly calculated the change of distance between the neighboring layers Δd = d_{surface}–d_{bulk}, where d_{surface} and d_{bulk} are the distances between two neighboring layers in relaxed surfaces and bulk, respectively. The Δd_{n} indicates the change of distance between the layer n the n − 1. If Δd is negative, it indicates that atomic layer distance in surface is decreased as compared with that in bulk. The results are summarized in Fig. 8 for the seven different surfaces. The surface Δd of seven different surfaces are all negative, meaning that atomic layer distances in surface are decreased, due to the surface structures cut from bulk. The Δd of –Sm1, –OO, –O, –Sm2, –CuOO, –CuO, and –Cu surfaces fluctuate around zero as one approaches the center of the slab and |Δd| gradually decreases to zero. For example, the Δd_{11} and Δd_{10} are −0.18 and 0.22 Å for the -Sm1 surface, implying that the L-11 and L-10 (Sm layer) move inward and L-10 (OO layer) moves outward after the atomic position relaxation. Similar movements are observed for other surfaces. It is also important to notice that there are surface atomic reconstructions for the −CuOO surface: at the surface (L-8), the Cu atoms are pulled outward about 0.08 Å while O atoms are pulled inward about 0.28 Å. A similar reconstruction occurs for the -O surface: one of the O atoms in L-8 layer is pulled outward about 0.29 Å and the other O atom in the same layer is pulled inward about 0.34 Å with respect to the Cu atoms in L-8 layer. This significant atomic reconstruction is due to the removal of one of the O atoms at the surface (L-10) layer. Also at the surface (L-8) layer of the -CuO surface, the Cu atom moves outward about 0.08 Å and the O atoms move inward about 0.20 Å.
To further understand the surface reconstruction, we also calculated the Bader charges in these surfaces with and without relaxation. The Bader charge difference between the surface layer (or atom) and the corresponding layer (or atom) in the bulk are shown in Fig. 8, and the value inside the parentheses indicates the results without relaxation. For all surface structures, the changes of charge difference are largest at the surface layer and rapidly decrease as one departs from the surface layer. The trend is the same as Δd shown in Fig. 8. For the surface atoms, they have a larger charge difference due to the dangling bonds. In -Sm1 surface structure, the surface Sm atom is a donor atom, so there are excess electrons due to the surface dangling bonds. We can see the Sm atom charge difference is 0.57 e^{−} due to free carriers accumulating in the surface [45] without relaxation but decreases to 0.45 e^{−} after structure relaxation. This clearly shows the intimate correlation between the surface atomic reconstruction and the electron charge redistribution.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
Using first-principles calculations, we have studied the ground state magnetic structure and the formation energy of various defects for bulk Sm_{2}CuO_{4} and the surface energies with different surface terminations. Our calculations reveal that the ground state magnetic structure is G-AFM. The AFM order arises from the strong p-dσ hybridization between Cu-d_{x2-y2} orbital and O-p_{x} (or p_{y}) orbital, inducing a hole-mediated superexchange mechanism. Through the formation energies of defects V_{Sm}, V_{Cu}, V_{O2}, Sm_{Cu} and Cu_{Sm.}, we have found the V_{Cu} is energetically favorable under O-rich conditions, while the formation energy of V_{O2} and Sm_{Cu} are lower than others under O-poor conditions. We have also studied the formation energies of the defects in various charge states. Under condition 1 (O-rich limit), the formation energies of V_{Cu} are lowest throughout the whole range of Fermi level. Under condition 9 (O-poor limit), the V_{O2} is dominant defect and act as a donor, indicating that n-type Sm_{2}CuO_{4} is preferable under O-poor conditions. Considering seven different surface structures, the –CuOO, –CuO (–Cu) or –Sm1 terminated surface is most stable under O-rich (O-poor) condition. We have also demonstrated that the significant surface atomic reconstruction and electron charge redistribution occur for all considered surfaces and these two are intimately related.

Δd is the change of distance between the neighboring layers Δd =d_{surface}-d_{bulk}, where d_{surface} and d_{bulk} are the distances between two neighboring layers for the relaxed (001) surfaces and bulk Sm_{2}CuO_{4}, respectively. The Δd_{N} indicates the change of distance between the layer N the layer N-1. The Bader charge difference between the surface layer (or atom) and the corresponding layer (or atom) in the bulk are shown in the figure, the value inside of the parentheses indicates the results without relaxation.
