Design of a facility for the in situ measurement of catalytic reaction by neutron scattering spectroscopy
Catalysis is a critical enabling science for future energy needs. The next frontier of catalysis is to evolve from catalyst discovery to catalyst design, and for this next step to be realized, we must develop new techniques to better understand reaction mechanisms. To do this, we must connect catalytic reaction rates and selectivities to the kinetics, energetics, and dynamics of individual elementary steps and relate these to the structure and dynamics of the catalytic sites involved. Neutron scattering spectroscopies offer unique capabilities that are difficult or impossible to match by other techniques. The current study presents the development of a compact and portable instrumental design that enables the in situ investigation of catalytic samples by neutron scattering techniques. The developed apparatus was tested at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) in Oak Ridge National Laboratory and includes a gas handling panel that allows for computer hookups to control the panel externally and online measurement equipment such as coupled GC-FID/TCD (Gas Chromatography-Flame Ionization Detector/Thermal Conductivity Detector) and MS (Mass Spectrometry) to characterize offgassing while the sample is in the neutron scattering spectrometer. This system is flexible, modular, compact, and portable enabling its use for many types of gas-solid and liquid-solid reactions at the various beamlines housed at the SNS.
I. INTRODUCTION
Approximately 80% of the processes in the chemical industry require catalysts, and catalysts contribute directly or indirectly to approximately 35% of the global GDP (Gross Domestic Product) [1]. The next frontier of catalysis is to evolve from catalyst discovery to catalyst design [2]. For this next step to be realized, we must meet one of the grand challenges stated in the 2007 DOE Basic Research Needs Workshop report on Catalysis for Energy, which is to “Understand reaction mechanisms and dynamics of catalyst transformations—Connect catalytic and photocatalytic reaction rates and selectivities to the kinetics, energetics, and dynamics of individual elementary steps and relate these to the structure and dynamics of the catalytic sites involved.” [3]
Neutron scattering (NS) offers unique capabilities and unparalleled sensitivity to hydrogen that are difficult or impossible to match by other techniques [4,5]. Furthermore, inelastic neutron scattering (INS) is a valuable analytical tool, which like other vibrational spectroscopies can be used to probe chemical transformations, providing information about molecular structures, chemical bonding, and intermolecular interactions as they occur during heterogeneous catalysis [6,7]. INS at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) located at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) is positioned to have a profound impact on catalysis, through kinetic analysis and mechanistic interpretations of the conversion of hydrogenous materials. VISION, which is the SNS’s vibrational spectrometer, has the equivalent of more than 4000 times the neutron count as any predecessor. Such a leap forward means routine samples can be measured in a matter of a few minutes as opposed to hours. This offers the prospect of improving time resolution in the kinetic analysis of catalytic reactions by INS spectroscopy.
While INS has many properties that complement other vibrational techniques and INS spectroscopy has enabled vibrational spectra to be measured for more than half a century, it has historically remained underutilized in mechanistic investigations in the field of catalysis unlike its counterpart techniques [8]. This is due to the sample and time requirements infamously required by neutron scattering techniques. Most of the analysis on the catalyst is done in a post-mortem fashion and very little in situ work focusing on the microscopic aspects of the catalyst has been performed [9,10]. For the first time, we are positioned to utilize neutron scattering spectroscopy to monitor kinetic events in catalytic reactions. While there are only a few research centers around the world for neutron scattering [11], such a technique has been attracting more and more attention in the field of heterogeneous catalysis since it probes the motion of atoms/molecules in the sample [12].
The current sample cell associated with the VISION beamline at SNS at ORNL is designed for ex situ measurement, limiting the use of INS as a probe in in situ measurements for investigating reactions at low temperature. Here, we have developed a work station that enables researchers working at the SNS by providing a means to investigate catalytic samples in situ using neutron scattering techniques. The combination of these two pieces of apparatus allows us to control gas flow and carry on in situ measurement for the catalytic reaction with gas chromatography (GC), mass spectrometry (MS), and INS, which provides a way to deeply understand reaction mechanisms. We present the design sections and a case study on hydrogenation of acetylene over Pd/Al_{2}O_{3} in this contribution.
II. SYSTEM DESIGN
A. Portable cart design
Most devices of this reaction analysis system are built into the cart and can be hooked up in the beamline at SNS such that the instrumentation can be controlled remotely from the hutch. Hence, the size of the cart was determined by the space allowed by the doorway of the instrument beamline cave. Moreover, considering the stability of the system, the 80/20 T-slot profiles were chosen as the framework of the cart and ¼ in. aluminum slots were used as the chassis to hold all equipment and parts. The design is shown in Fig. 1. The cart has four wheels all equipped with brakes to ensure the stability of the cart during reaction. The vertical panel on the top deck is used as the gas handling interface, while the back as well as bottom deck has the analysis equipment (gas chromatography, mass spectrometer, H_{2} generator). In front of the vertical panel, a laptop can be used as the work station to control the entire system.
B. Gas panel design
The gas handling panel contains a gas purifier (VICI Metronics) to remove impurity and moisture from the cylinder, mass flow controller (MFC, Alicat Scientific), and mass flow meter (MFM, Alicat Scientific). These components are connected by 1/8” stainless steel tubing with appropriate 2/3-way switching valves (Swagelok). All parts were mounted on the back side of the panel, while leaving windows for the mass flow controller/meter and valve to the front side in order to allow users to observe and operate. This gas handling system can deliver up to 4 gas flows to the sample during an INS experiment. The detail configuration and the actual panel can be found in Fig. 2. Gas flow can be controlled by setting the MFC separately, with each gas line containing a check valve to prevent reverse flow. All tubing is 1/8 in. diameter 316 stainless steel from Swagelok. After passing the MFM, the gas mixture goes to a flow cell for in situ INS experiment, followed by the measurement of GC-FID/TCD (Gas Chromatography-Flame Ionization Detector/Thermal Conductivity Detector) and/or MS. It should be noted that the panel also leaves a port where liquid samples can be injected. The corresponding tubing was wrapped with heating tape and the temperature was monitored and controlled by a thermocouple and temperature controller. Such functionality makes the system more flexible for not only measuring in situ INS experiment but also running a routine kinetic test where the reactant is in the liquid phase under room temperature.
C. Flow cell design
The sample chamber of the Closed-Cycle Refrigerator (CCR) used on the VISION beamline has an inner diameter of 84 mm. Fitting a flow cell in this relatively tight space presents a challenge. The sample cell is normally supported at the end of a stick to be inserted (with helium gas flowing) in the sample chamber. This top-loading design permits samples to be changed with the refrigerator at temperatures as low as 5 K. The use of a flow cell presents particular challenges. In addition to the signal and power cables used for thermometry, a minimum of two heated gas lines must be run along the stick axis from the gas-handling setup to the flow cell. Because of the permanent temperature gradient from room temperature (on top of the stick/CCR) to the coldest temperature (at the bottom of the stick/CCR), the gas lines need to be thermally isolated—mostly to prevent condensation of the gas or mixture of gases flowing to the sample cell. This dictates a design with a large (1 in. diameter) center stick diameter (Fig. 3). This space is kept under high vacuum. In it runs (a) two gas lines (steel tubing, quarter inch diameter), (b) four two-wire thermocouple cables and type K thermocouples arranged uniformly along the gas lines over the length of the stick, (c) two four-wire diode cables for sample thermometry, and (d) two two-wire cables for heater blocks for the sample cell.
On top of the stick, these various electrical and gas lines go through suitable vacuum feedthroughs. At the bottom of the stick, the 1-in. pipe expands to a chamber to allow for spatial separation of the gas lines and the connection of (c) and (d) to a 15-pin D-type, vacuum-tight feedthrough, Fig. 4. This “utilities” chamber is welded to the 1-in. center pipe. The flange at the bottom of this “utilities” chamber is removable to allow for repairs, as necessary.
Since this chamber is in the cold part on the CCR sample chamber, a rubber O-ring was not suitable for sealing. Instead we used the system depicted in Fig. 5 and used a sticky Kapton tape to establish a vacuum-tight seal. The seal was tested, first by immersion in liquid nitrogen and then in the CCR itself at a temperature of 5 K. In both cases, it was possible to maintain a vacuum of the order of 10^{−6} mbar for a couple of days. To complete the test, we removed the stick from the (cold, 5 K) CCR and brought it up to room temperature and then returned the assembly to the cold CCR. This operation was repeated half a dozen times. The Kapton seal never showed any sign of failure. This flexible design of the stick allows for a variety of cells and heater block assemblies to be connected at the bottom of the stick without sacrificing the limited space available at the bottom of the CCR sample chamber.
III. INSTRUMENT PERFORMANCE
Characterization and determination of active adsorbate and intermediate are of particular importance in terms of elucidating the reaction mechanism in the area of heterogeneous catalysis. A major difficulty is due to the differences of characterization condition and reaction condition. To this end, conventional IR spectroscopy is an effective approach for in situ measurement of a variety of catalytic systems and even allow us to carry out a transient study when equipped with proper accessories (i.e., SSITKA (Steady State Isotopic Transient Kinetic Analysis)) [13]. However, the selection rule of IR still applies and constricts such a technique from being widely applied. By contrast, there are no selection rules for neutron scattering, meaning that all vibrational modes make contributions to the total intensity (weighted by the cross section and vibrational amplitude). Neutron scattering is particularly sensitive to hydrogen due to its large scattering cross section. The detection limit at VISION is about 0.1–1 mmol of hydrogen. Neutrons have no charge and do not interact with electrons. Instead, they interact with the nuclei directly. As a result, neutrons can penetrate very deep into the materials, and the typical sample size at VISION is on the order of cm. Almost all materials can be studied with neutron scattering except probably a few heavy neutron absorbers (such as Gd, Cd, and ^{10}B).
In this study, the hydrogenation of acetylene over Pd/Al_{2}O_{3} was chosen as the model reaction. It has been reported that the surface and subsurface hydrides could directly affect the activity and selectivity [14,15]. Considering the constraint of IR spectroscopy and advantages of the neutron spectroscopy, the latter technique is the best mean to measure the arise of hydride species and determine the key factors that control the activity and selectivity.
The INS experiment was performed at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) located at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) on the VISION beamline, which is the SNS’s neutron vibrational spectrometer. Approximately 3 g of the Pd/Al_{2}O_{3} sample was loaded in an alumina flow cell and preheated to 383 K for 2 h under vacuum. The background spectrum was first collected after the flow cell cooled down to 5 K and was subtracted from all other spectra during the interpretation. Figure 6 is the stack of the sequential adsorption and the static reaction with fixed amounts of C_{2}H_{2} and H_{2} (1.5 mmol each) sealed in the flow cell at varying temperatures. In order to have better comparison and band assignment, the individual organic (C_{2}H_{2}, C_{2}H_{4}, and C_{2}H_{6}) NVS (Neutron Vibrational Specta) were computed and are shown in Fig. 6. Details of the calculation can be found in the supplementary material.
The black spectrum refers to the adsorption of C_{2}H_{2} over Pd/Al_{2}O_{3}, with featured peaks present at ca. 630 and 780 cm^{−1}. According to the calculation, these modes correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric C–H bending, respectively. Molecular hydrogen was loaded into the sample environment at 35 K. This lowest possible temperature was chosen to avoid the condensation of H_{2} which has a critical point of 33 K and has minimum possibility of a reaction. The red curve is obtained after an addition of a known quantity of H_{2} (1:1 ratio). Two new bands appeared at ca. 110 and 230 cm^{−1}, assigned to the rotational/vibrational modes of molecular H_{2} [16]. It should be noted that C_{2}H_{2} peaks are still observable, indicating coexistence of both species (C_{2}H_{2} and H_{2}) at the catalyst surface. Then, the cells are heated sequentially to 100, 160, 200, and 240 K for 30 min and subsequently cooled back to 5 K to take the spectra (see curves in green, blue, cyan, and magenta, respectively). It should be mentioned that measuring at low temperature allows us to minimize the effects of the Debye-Waller factor, which tends to suppress/smear the signal at elevated temperatures [17]. As can be seen, H_{2} peak intensities start to decrease from 100 K, indicating the loss of H_{2}. However, the C_{2}H_{2} band intensity remains until 200 K and starts to decrease at 240 K. Meanwhile, a new band at ca. 830 cm^{−1} is observed, which can be assigned to the –CH_{2} rocking mode in the C_{2}H_{4} product. These observations suggest that semi-hydrogenation occurs at 200–240 K. It should be mentioned that for fully hydrogenating acetylene to ethane, we would expect a sharp peak at ca. 300 cm^{−1} corresponding to the torsion of –CH_{3} (as assigned by the calculation). The absence of such a peak indicates that C_{2}H_{2} is only half-hydrogenated under the conditions used in our experiment.
The great capability of palladium to adsorb hydrogen and form a hydride phase was well recognized [18]. Since then, the binary system becomes a subject to many theoretical and experimental studies. Very recently, several reports suggest that the adsorbed hydrogen species play key role in determining activity and selectivity for alkyne hydrogenation over the Pd-based catalyst [14]. For example, both Freund and Sautet proposed that the subsurface hydrogen is more active, while the surface hydrogen is more selective [15,19]. Hence, we made a close examination of the spectra in Fig. 6 within the region of 300–2000 cm^{−1} in order to gain insights between active species and catalytic performance. As shown in Fig. 7, the spectra are obtained by subtracting the combination of C_{2}H_{2} and H_{2} signals in a least square regression. At 100 K, the difference spectrum shows no new features (green line in Fig. 7). This means at this temperature, no reaction has occurred, and the system still contains a mixture of C_{2}H_{2} and H_{2}. The loss of H_{2} at this temperature is because a fraction of H_{2} moved out of the neutron beam (i.e., relocated in the sample container-stick system) after heating to 100 K and cooling back to 5 K. When temperature was raised to 160 K, a new band (ca. 460 cm^{−1}) shows up with a shoulder at ca. 650 cm^{−1}. This peak is assigned as subsurface palladium hydride [20]. However, in the region of 700–2000 cm^{−1}, where the characteristic peaks of C_{2}H_{4} are supposed to be observed, the signal is still close to zero. This observation suggests that at this temperature, palladium hydride species started to form while no hydrogenation reaction occurred. A further increase of temperature to 200 K leads to the appearance of several bands within 700–2000 cm^{−1} (830, 950, 1050, 1250, 1400 cm^{−1}). By comparing with the calculation, they can be assigned to various vibrational modes of C_{2}H_{4} (830: rocking, 950: wagging, 1050: twisting, 1250: symmetric scissoring, 1400: asymmetric scissoring of the CH_{2}).
Tysoe et_al measured C_{2}H_{2} and C_{2}H_{4} adsorption on Pd(111) and Pd/Al_{2}O_{3} at 80 and 300 K with IR spectroscopy and found that C_{2}H_{4} exhibited featured peaks at 1089 and 1329 cm^{−1} [21,22]. These two bands are consistent with our observation at 1050 and 1400 cm^{−1}. The broad peak at 1268 cm^{−1} due to C_{2}H_{2} adsorption is also aligned with our observation (see Fig. 6).
For the case of 240 K, similar behavior was found with a stronger signal for C_{2}H_{4}, indicating further conversion of C_{2}H_{2} to C_{2}H_{4}.
The cart was connected to a flow cell to measure the hydrogenation reaction under flow condition (see Fig. 8). 0.5 SCCM C_{2}H_{2} mixed with H_{2} (balanced with He) at 50 SCCM total flow rate was co-fed to the flow cell (loaded with 2.3 g Pd/Al_{2}O_{3}) at 200 K. After purging with He, the sample was cooled down to 5 K to obtain INS data. It can be seen in Fig. 9 that at the two current cases (C_{2}H_{2}/H_{2} = 1/2 and 1/10), only broad peaks ca. 400–800 cm^{−1} show up (black and red curves, respectively). This is assigned as hydride species. Unfortunately, the absence of any hydrocarbon peaks is probably due to the weak bonding at the surface and being removed during the He purging step. The computational results for bulk C_{2}H_{2}, C_{2}H_{4}, and C_{2}H_{6} are also shown in Fig. 9 (green, blue, and cyan, respectively).
It should be mentioned that the reaction rate in Figs. 7 and 9 is quite slow due to the low beamline temperature, and the volume of tubing connecting the flow cell and the MS is unknown. This makes it difficult to estimate the resident time to correlate the data collected from MS and neutron measurement. Hence, we are unable to quantitatively calculate the activity during the INS measurements. Accordingly, we carried out the following experiment in the reaction hood to examine the applicability of coupling GC/MS analysis in situ. Specifically, 0.15 g of Pd/Al_{2}O_{3} mixed with quartz sand (0.15 g) was loaded at the bottom of a U-shaped tubular reactor with 1/8 in. I.D. The two ends were sealed with quartz wool. The reactor was put into a cooling bath with a Dewar. The cold bath is made by slurry of liquid N_{2} with acetonitrile, which has a melting point of −41 °C. C_{2}H_{2} was set to 0.6 SCCM as background (see first step in Fig. 10), while H_{2} was stepwise added from 0.2 to 1.2 SCCM (the C_{2}H_{2}/H_{2} ratio was set to 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 2:3, and 1:2 respectively). The total flow rate was set to be 50 SCCM with He as the balance gas. The GC and MS were used simultaneously throughout the entire reaction and results were shown in Fig. 10.
As can be seen, the conversion increases as the H_{2} flow rate increases. However, the C_{2}H_{4} selectivity remained at 100% no matter H_{2} is insufficient or excess with respect to the stoichiometry. Such observation suggests the occurrence of semi-hydrogenation and the absence of full-hydrogenation. This phenomenon is also consistent with what we have observed in Figs. 7 and 9. In order to further verify such observation, a series of tests with conventional tubular tests were carried out at different temperatures, and the results are summarized in the supplementary material (Fig. S2). In summary, within the tested temperature ranges (179–298 K), most tests show C_{2}H_{4} as the primary product, except the case at 298 K with H_{2} being excessive [Fig. S2(d) of the supplementary material]. This is possibly due to the high activity of Pd at this temperature.
It should also be mentioned that current neutron spectroscopy is not a good quantitative measurement. Taking into the account that many factors for the reactions carried out in a conventional tubular reaction and in a neutron beamline (i.e., catalyst mass, space velocity of C_{2}H_{2}, resident time, temperature), it brings us difficulty to rigorously compare the catalytic performance, such as selectivity/activation energy. Nevertheless, this does not affect our conclusion towards these kinetic aspects (activity and selectivity).
IV. OUTLOOK
In this work, we present a new reaction control cart and a new flow cell that was constructed at SNS ORNL. It has been tested on the VISION beamline for a series of experiments at temperatures varying from 100 to 240 K. The cell can be used for a wide range of temperatures and is adjustable to be used on many of the beamlines at the SNS. This flow cell can be used at the SNS for a wide range of measurements under different reaction conditions, allowing us to study chemical/physical processes in situ and ex situ.
The reaction cart contains online gas flow controllers and purification system to deliver gaseous reactants to catalysts and an onboard analysis system including GC and MS to characterize any gaseous offgassing. When combined with the flow cell designed for the SNS, it has the advantage of studying the catalytic system under flow condition while monitoring the catalyst bed using various neutron scattering techniques.
