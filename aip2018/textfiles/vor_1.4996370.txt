Excellent field emission properties of VO_{2}(A) nanogap emitters in air
VO_{2}(A) emitters with a 10 nm gap between the emitter and the collector were fabricated with the aid of focused ion beam etching. Due to the extremely small electrode gap, high emission currents (upto 53 μA at 1 V) and excellent emission stability were achieved in air with a turn-on voltage as low as 0.46 V. The field emission behavior exhibits a temperature dependence, which is attributed to the temperature-induced reduction of the work function. This work provides a practical way to ease the demand of high vacuum and high operation voltage in vacuum devices, which is helpful for developing low-power nanoscale vacuum devices.
Vacuum is an ideal medium for ballistic transport since electron transport in vacuum does not suffer scattering as in a solid-state medium, and vacuum devices show immunity against radiation and other harsh conditions [1]. However, vacuum devices commonly suffer from low emission currents and high operating voltages, which greatly weaken their competitiveness against solid-state devices. Nanoscale vacuum channel electronics has been receiving much attention recently for its high performance under low voltage. Recent efforts in this direction have addressed wafer scale fabrication of vacuum channel transistors using silicon [1,2] surrounded gate vacuum channel transistors [3] with a source to drain distance of 50 nm and 2- and 3-terminal devices with short gaps enabled by e-beam lithography [4], among others [5–7]. The nanoscale gap between the emitter and the collector allows operation in air since the mean free path of electrons exceeds the gap size. Besides, the choice of emitter material is critical to achieve a good emission performance, which has been dictated by the work function, thermal stability, and other emission properties [8].
Field emission (FE) from one-dimensional nanostructures such as nanotubes and nanowires has attracted much attention due to the high electric fields achievable with low voltages. For example, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and nano-diamond emitters have been studied extensively, showing great emission properties [9,10]. However, it is hard to make a nanoscale vacuum channel among CNTs without destroying their original morphologies or crystal structures. The reported methods to fabricate nanodiamond emitters [5,6,11] cannot meet the need for nanometer scale channels neither. Alternatively, one-dimensional metal oxides with a low surface potential barrier can be taken as field emitters for nano-channel vacuum electronics. Among various metal oxides, vanadium dioxide is attractive because of the multiform polymorphs and special optical, electrical, and magnetic properties [12]. FE behavior of the bundle-like B phase of VO_{2} nanostructures has been reported, showing excellent field emission properties [13,14]. A phase of VO_{2} shares a similar structure with the B phase and can be synthesized controllably with tunable morphologies [15]. A phase of VO_{2} can be an alternative emitter material. However, its field emission behavior has been scarcely reported due to the harsh growth conditions (obtained exclusively by a hydrothermal method). The knowledge of its FE properties is of significance for its potential application in emerging nanoscale vacuum electronics. Here, we report the fabrication of a two-terminal emission device with a nanogap using a single VO_{2}(A) nanowire. The emission is turned on below 1 V in air with excellent emission stability and high emission current. A systematic study of the FE properties at different temperatures is also reported.
0.3 g of V_{2}O_{5} powder and 0.6 g of oxalic acid dihydrate (C_{2}H_{2}O_{4}•2H_{2}O) were dissolved in 30 mL of deionized water and stirred for 40 min to form a homogeneous solution. The solution was then heated at 220 °C for 60 h in a high temperature drying oven and cooled down at room temperature. The resultant precipitate was washed with distilled water and anhydrous ethanol alternately and then dried at 70 °C for several hours in a drying oven. The powders were subsequently dispersed into deionized water by an ultrasonic cleaner. The dispersion solution was dropped slowly on to a cleaned SiO_{2}/Si substrate. After drying for some time, the nanowires were dispersed on the SiO_{2}/Si substrate as shown in Fig. 1(a). HRTEM images and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns in Fig. 1(b) indicate that the as-synthesized VO_{2}(A) nanowire is single crystalline and grows along the [001] direction. The phase structure investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) in Fig. 1(c) shows patterns consistent with the metastable tetragonal phase of VO_{2}(A) (JCPDS: 42‐0876).
Two Au electrodes were bridged by a single VO_{2}(A) nanowire with the help of a nanoprobe in the focused ion beam (FIB) as shown in Fig. 2(a). Then, the nanowire with an original thickness of ∼500 nm was thinned to ∼80 nm by FIB etching and cut off at one end to form the nanogap between the emitter and the collector as shown in Figs. 2(b) and 2(c). The nanowire thickness and the nanogap size were controlled by changing the etching time and etching strength. The thickness reduction rate was ∼10 nm/s with FIB setting at 30 kV and 1.5 pA. A tip with a radius of ∼5 nm and a gap of ∼10 nm was created by etching the thinned nanowire in FIB for 500 ms, and larger gaps could be created with progressively longer etching time. The SAED pattern of the final nanoemitter in Fig. 2(d) was found to be crystalline as the initial nanowire, indicating that the crystal structure was not influenced by the FIB etching process. Field emission measurements were taken in an ambient environment using a Keithley 4200-csc Parameter Analyzer.
For VO_{2}(A) nanoemitters with ∼10 nm gaps, the emission current increases exponentially in air at room temperature once the collector voltage is beyond 0.46 V as seen in Fig. 3(a). The linearity in the F-N plot [the inset of Fig. 3(a)] confirms that it is Fowler-Nordheim tunneling. The gap here is much smaller than the electron mean free path in air (200 nm), and so, most electrons emitted from the emitter can arrive at the collector without collisions with air molecules. It is of great importance to make the devices operating under ambient conditions due to the reduced packaging cost. A maximum current of 53 μA is achieved at 1 V in air. Such a large emission current from an individual emitter at such a low voltage has not been demonstrated before. Previously reported current levels for triodes include 1–10 μA at drive voltages upto 10 V [1,2,4]. The high current achieved here is ideal for future FE-based vacuum devices with the potential for scaling. In addition, the turn-on voltage V_{on} (to induce a current of 1 nA) here is the lowest (about 0.5 V) compared to previously reported field emission diodes with small gaps [4,7,16–20].
The excellent field emission performance here can be attributed to three reasons: (i) the ultra-short emitter-collector distance, which enables a high field at a relatively low voltage; (ii) the sharp tip made by FIB etching, which brings a high local field enhancement effect; (iii) the perfect crystal structure of the tip before and after FIB etching, which contributes to the emission stability.
The field emission stability at 1.1 μA in air is shown in Fig. 3(b). No obvious fluctuation of current is observed, and the emission current increases slightly by 0.8% after 90 min, showing high emission stability. A similar increase in emission current with time has been reported previously [20], but no discussion about the increase was given. Electric field induced material migration was reported to give rise to such field emission instability with evident metal atom accumulation at the anode [21]. However, no such formation of hillocks was observed at the anode in our SEM images after field emission tests. The drive voltage in our experiments is much lower than that reported for metal atoms' electromigration. Thus, electric field mediated instability should not be the main reason for the tiny current increment after 90 min. We attribute this phenomenon to the FE sensitivity of VO_{2}(A) emitters to temperature, which is further confirmed in our next set of experiments. The temperature of the emitter goes up slowly with emission time due to the accumulation of Joule heat and consequently increases the emission by lowering the effective work function of the emitter.
The temperature-dependent field emission properties of VO_{2}(A) emitters with nanogaps were measured in ambient next. Figure 3(c) shows the relationship between the emission current and applied voltage at different temperatures. The emission is significantly enhanced with temperature increasing from 233 K to 333 K (the first test) and can be repeated with temperature decreasing from 333 K to 233 K (the second test). The measured emission current should be the result of both field emission and thermionic emission. However, the thermionic emission is small enough to be neglected at such a low temperature [22]. Therefore, the emission current is mainly from field emission, which can also be confirmed by the straight lines in F-N plots shown in Fig. 3(d). According to the Fowler-Nordheim equation, the work function φ can be expressed as
The value of B can be determined by tracing the slope of the F-N plots. The field enhancement factor β can be modeled [23] by β = h/r, where h is the length of the emitter and r is the radius of the emitter. Some sawtooth structures are induced to the VO_{2} nanowire after FIB etching as shown in Figs. 2(b) and 2(c). But most sawtooth structures will not be active during the field emission process except the most front one. So, here, r is taken as the radius of the tip (∼5 nm) and h is the length of the thinner part (∼800 nm). Therefore, φ at different temperatures can be calculated and is plotted in Fig. 3(e). φ depends on temperature linearly and shows a decrease from ∼2.1 to 1.0 eV with the temperature increasing from 233 to 333 K. The work function at 298 K calculated from Fig. 3(e) is 1.46 eV. The work function values of other polymorphs of vanadium dioxide have been reported previously, while the work function of VO_{2}(A) is absent in the literature. There are two common methods to measure the work function of bulk or film materials, by Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS) and Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM). However, both these methods are inapplicable for our samples because the dimension of VO_{2} nanowires (∼600 nm) is too small to get an accurate measurement. The work function of VO_{2}(A) is then theoretically calculated according to a general work function model [24]. The calculated value is 1.24 eV at 298 K which is 0.22 eV lower than our results from field emission tests. As field emission in our experiments was carried out in ambient, the presence of adsorbates at the VO_{2}(A) surface is thought to be the main reason for the difference. The rapid reduction in the work function with increasing temperature at a rate of 0.011 eV/K seen here in Fig. 3(e) is comparable to the rate of 0.009 eV/K for the VO_{2} (M/R) thin film [25] from 333 K to 353 K. The work function appears to be sensitive to environmental parameters including adsorbates.
The temperature-enhanced field emission can be further confirmed by detecting emission current at different temperatures at a fixed voltage, as shown in Fig. 3(f). The current increases nearly one order of magnitude with the increase in temperature from 233 K to 333 K and decreases by the same amount in the reverse.
In summary, VO_{2}(A) emitters with nanoscale gaps were fabricated from a single nanowire by FIB etching. The results here are remarkable, showing the possibility of stable and high emission current at low voltage in the air environment. Moreover, the field emission properties were shown to be enhanced with an increase in ambient temperature due to a decrease in the work function. This preliminary work is valuable for the design of VO_{2} field emitters for future nanoscale vacuum electronics. Future work would include the FE properties of VO_{2} (A) nanowires with different dopants and the fabrication of three-terminal devices.
