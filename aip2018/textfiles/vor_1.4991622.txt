CuS nanoplates from ionic liquid precursors—Application in organic photovoltaic cells
Hexagonal p-type semiconductor CuS nanoplates were synthesized via a hot injection method from bis(trimethylsilyl)sulfide and the ionic liquid precursor bis(N-dodecylpyridinium) tetrachloridocuprate(ii). The particles have a broad size distribution with diameters between 30 and 680 nm and well-developed crystal habits. The nanoplates were successfully incorporated into organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells as hole conduction materials. The power conversion efficiency of OPV cells fabricated with the nanoplates is 16% higher than that of a control device fabricated without the nanoplates.
I. INTRODUCTION
Semiconductor nanoparticles (NPs) have attracted tremendous attention for countless applications. This is mainly due to their unique properties arising from size-dependent quantum confinement effects [1,2]. Moreover, their nanometer dimensions generate a much higher surface area-to-volume ratio, which provides enhanced interaction between the NPs and the surrounding material [3]. Among others, metal chalcogenide NPs such as ZnS [4], CuS [5], CuIn(Se,S)_{2} [6,7], CuInGa(Se,S)_{2} [8,9], and Cu_{2}ZnSn(Se,S)_{4} [10,11] have been used to improve the optoelectronic properties of solar cells or light emitters [12–18]. For example, CuS, a p-type semiconductor, has been investigated for its application in ultraviolet (UV) photodetectors and organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells [19–25].
One of the issues in the development of such devices is the design of NPs suitable for these applications. While the precipitation of metal sulfide NPs can be achieved via numerous processes, the detailed control over the NP shapes, sizes, size distributions, crystal phase, crystal phase homogeneity, and possible doping is not straightforward [26,27]. This particularly applies to the a priori design of their electronic and optical properties [27,28]. New approaches towards a rational and reliable a priori design of metal chalcogenide NPs are therefore highly sought after.
Among others, ionic liquids (ILs) have shown potential for nanomaterial design and NP tuning [29,30]. Of relevance to the current study, we have previously introduced the concept of ionic liquid precursors (ILPs) for nanomaterial synthesis, where the IL acts as a solvent-template-reactant and provides access to materials that are difficult to synthesize otherwise [31–33].
The work reported here is rooted in the ILP concept and describes the synthesis of hexagonal CuS nanoplates (CNPs) synthesized via hot-injection from bis(N-dodecylpyridinium) tetrachloridocuprate(ii), [C_{12}Py]_{2}[CuCl_{4}] [33,34], and bis(trimethylsilyl)sulfide, (TMS)_{2}S. The resulting particles were evaluated as hole transport materials in bulk hetero-junction (BHJ) OPV cells based on poly(3-hexylthiophene):phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) active layer blends. The hole transport (hole collection) properties of CuS in OPV cells have already been demonstrated for single CuS anode buffer layers [25]. In spite of this, relatively few studies on such systems are available and these studies were performed only with a conventional device structure [23,24].
Here, the effects of the CNPs on OPV cell performance were investigated by embedding the NPs in the P3HT:PCBM active layer blends for both conventional and inverted structures. CNPs in the active layer blends provide a broad optical absorption window and improve the charge transport [35,36]. The hole collection process strongly depends on film preparation and film homogeneity, and the CNPs are viable candidates for the fabrication of new hybrid OPV cells.
II. EXPERIMENTAL
A. Materials
N-dodecylpyridinium chloride (Aldrich, ≥98%), CuCl_{2}·2H_{2}O (Fluka, ≥99%), acetonitrile (Aldrich, 99.8%), (TMS)_{2}S (Aldrich, 99%), oleylamine (OAm) (Aldrich, 98%), zinc acetate dihydrate (Aldrich, 99%), tetramethylammonium hydroxide pentahydrate (TMAH) (Aldrich, 97%), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (Heraeus, Clevios P VP AI4083, aqueous dispersion with 1.3–1.7 wt. %), poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) (Aldrich, 90%), phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) (Solenne BV, 99.0%), Ca (Aldrich, 99.0%), Ag (Umicore, 99.9%), MoO_{3} (Aldrich, 99.99%), ethanol (Rotisolv, 99.8%), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Merck, 99%), 1-butanol (Chemsolute, 99.5%), chlorobenzene (CHB) (Aldrich, anhydrous, 99.8%), 2-methoxyethanol (2ME) (Aldrich, 99.5%), ethanolamine (FLUKA 99%), n-hexane (Rotisolv, 96%), toluene (Chemsolute, 99.5%), tetrachloroethylene (TCE) (Aldrich, 99%), hydrophobic filters (Rotilabo, PTFE 5 μm, 1 μm, 0.2 μm, and 0.45 μm), and hydrophilic filters (Rotilabo, nylon 0.2 μm) were used as received.
B. Synthesis of CNPs
The ILP [C_{12}Py]_{2}[CuCl_{4}] was prepared according to Refs [33] and  [34]. CNPs were synthesized via hot-injection under argon. First 4 mmol of [C_{12}Py]_{2}[CuCl_{4}] were heated to 120 °C. Then 4 mmol of (TMS)_{2}S were added in one step with a syringe, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 4 h at 120 °C. After cooling to room temperature, the dark solid products were collected by centrifugation, washed several times with absolute ethanol, and dried in a vacuum oven at room temperature for 12 h.
C. Stabilization and redispersion of CNPs
For the fabrication of OPV cells, the CNPs were capped with OAm ligands according to Ref [25]. 10 mg of dry CNPs was dispersed in 2 mL of DMSO, then 2 mL of OAm was added at room temperature. The mixture was gently shaken by hand for 60 s. Upon standing at room temperature, a two-phase system formed and the CNPs transferred to the OAm phase as indicated by the dark color of the upper phase. Finally, the OAm-capped NPs were washed once with 26 mL of ethanol and dried under vacuum for 24 h at room temperature.
D. Synthesis of ZnO NPs
ZnO NPs were synthesized according to a procedure modified from Refs [37] and  [38]. First, 5.5 mmol of zinc acetate dihydrate were dissolved in 80 mL of 2ME. Then 10 mmol of TMAH dissolved in 8 mL of 2ME were added dropwise to the zinc acetate solution over 10 min followed by the addition of 1.6 mL of ethanolamine. The ZnO NPs were precipitated by addition of toluene (176 mL) and hexane (80 mL), and centrifugation. 1/3 of the toluene was added first to the solution followed by adding 1/3 of hexane. This was repeated three times upon which the solution turned turbid. After centrifugation and decantation of the supernatant, the ZnO NPs were redispersed in 1-butanol (22 mL, ca. 1.4 wt. % of ZnO). Synthesis and washing were done at ambient conditions.
E. Device fabrication
Eight types of OPV cells containing different active layers and device structures were built. Devices A, B, E, F, G, and H were designed with a conventional device structure (i.e., ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM:CuS/Ca/Ag). Devices C and D were designed with an inverted device structure (i.e., ITO/ZnO/P3HT:PCBM:CuS/Ag). All devices were fabricated on indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with 2 vol. % Hellmanex III solution.
Hole collection layer (HCL): PEDOT:PSS solution (1.3–1.7 wt. %) was filtered through a hydrophilic membrane filter with 0.2 μm pore size and spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s onto the ITO glass substrate followed by drying at 120 °C for 15 min.
Electron transport layer (ETL): ZnO NPs dispersed in 1-butanol (1.4 wt. %) were filtered with a hydrophobic membrane filter with 0.2 μm pore size and spin-coated at 2000 rpm for 30 s onto the ITO glass substrate followed by drying at 180 °C for 15 min.
Active layer: For active layer deposition, a mixture of P3HT:PCBM:CuS with a different blending weight ratio in CHB and a total concentration of 54 mg/mL was stirred at 75 °C for 12 h. A P3HT:PCBM:CuS ratio of 1:1:0.1 was applied in the cases of the devices A, B, C, and D. In addition, ratios of 1:0.8:0.1, 1:0.8:0.2, and 1:0.8:0.3 were applied for optimizing the conventional OPV cells (i.e., devices E, F, G, and H). The solution was filtered through a hydrophobic membrane filter with different pore sizes (0.45 or 0.2 μm), spin-coated at 1500–1850 rpm for 30 s, and dried at 120 °C for 15 min to form an approximately 200 nm thick active layer. The active pixel area of 4 mm^{2} was defined with the passivation layer pre-patterned on top of the ITO glass.
Top electrode: 30 nm/150 nm of Ca/Ag for conventional and 150 nm of Ag for inverted devices were deposited by thermal evaporation in a high vacuum chamber (3 × 10^{−6} torr).
F. Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were collected on a PANalytical Empyrean powder X-ray diffractometer with Bragg-Brentano geometry, equipped with a PIXcel1D detector using CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5419 Å) and operating at 40 kV and 40 mA. Theta-theta scans were run during 190 min over a 2θ range of 4–70° with a step size of 0.0131° and a sample rotation time of 1 s. For fluorescence reduction, the PHD level of the detector was set to 45–80.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were acquired on a Philips CM 200 instrument with a LaB_{6} cathode operated at 200 kV. TEM samples were prepared by drop-casting the CNP dispersion on a carbon-coated Cu grid. The diameter of the CNPs was determined from the TEM images using the ImageJ software.
Ultraviolet (UV)–visible (vis)–near infrared (NIR) absorption spectroscopy data were acquired with a PerkinElmer Lambda 19 spectrometer with a scan step of 1 nm between 300 and 2500 nm. The UV–vis–NIR absorption of CNPs in CHB and TCE (i.e., for NIR measurements) was determined from NP dispersions with a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. Absorption spectra of P3HT:PBMB:CuS active films were measured with the samples deposited on ITO glass by the same process applied in device preparation. The bandgap of the CNPs was determined from Tauc-plots drawn from the absorption spectrum. According to Tauc, the dependence of the absorption coefficient α on the photon energy hν for near-edge optical absorption in semiconductors is
where E_{g} is the optical bandgap, k is the constant, m is a number which relates to the mechanism of the transmission process, and m = 1/2 or 3/2 for direct allowed or direct forbidden transitions while m = 2 or 3 for indirect allowed or indirect forbidden transitions, respectively. Since the CNPs have a directly allowed transition, (αhν)^{2} was plotted versus hν. The direct bandgap of the CNPs was obtained by extrapolation of the linear part to the zero of the ordinate [39,40].
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was done on a NEXUS 6700 FT-IR spectrometer (Thermo-Nicolet, Diamond). Attenuated total reflection (ATR) correction was done via Omnic 6.2 (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Germany). Spectra were recorded between 4000 and 400 cm^{−1} with a resolution of 4 cm^{−1} and 32 scans per spectrum.
UV-photoelectron spectroscopy (PESA, Riken Keiki AC-2) to measure ionization energy (IE), which corresponds to the valence band maximum (VBM), was done with CNP thin films deposited on a glass substrate. UV intensity was 300 nW, and energy step was 0.1 eV. Measurements were done in air.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was done on a Nanosurf Easyscan-2 (cantilever ACLA-20, n-type silicon, spring constant 36–90 N/m, scan size of 5 × 5 μm). Roughness values in the article are averages obtained from three randomly selected scan regions per sample.
Contact profilometry to determine the film thicknesses was done with Veeco Dektak 150 with the vertical bit resolution of 1 Å and a stylus radius of 12.5 μm.
Characterization of OPV cells: Current density-voltage (J-V) data were measured under nitrogen using a Keithley 2400 source meter in the dark or with 100 mW/cm^{2} of simulated solar irradiation (AM 1.5G, K.H Steuernagel light source). A silicon reference diode with a KG3 filter calibrated at Fraunhofer ISE was used to adjust the light intensity prior to the measurements. Open-circuit voltage (V_{oc}), short-circuit current density (J_{sc}), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs; PCE = J_{sc} × V_{oc} × FF/P_{in}, where P_{in} is the incident optical power) were calculated from the J-V curve.
III. RESULTS
A. CuS nanoplates (CNPs)
The synthesis produced 260 mg of CNPs in powder form, which corresponds to a yield of 68%. Figures 1(a), 1(c), and 1(d) show powder XRD and TEM data of the hexagonal CNPs obtained by the reaction of [C_{12}Py]_{2}[CuCl_{4}] and (TMS)_{2}S. The reflections in the XRD patterns are broad, indicating nanocrystalline products [41]. The XRD pattern can be assigned to hexagonal covellite (ICDD 98-006-3327). TEM confirms the formation of hexagonal NPs. The particles are hexagonal plates with a broad diameter distribution ranging from 30 to 680 nm. TEM shows that the particles are rather thin at only 4–20 nm; this can be seen from TEM images showing particles standing upright on the TEM grid. Finally, the line patterns that are visible in Fig. 1(d) are Moiré patterns arising from overlapping particles with a slightly different crystal orientation. These patterns prove the high level of crystallinity in the NPs [42].
Figure 1(b) shows UV–vis–NIR spectroscopy of as-prepared CNPs dispersed in TCE. TCE is a good dispersant for measurements in the NIR because it does not show an absorption in this range. The spectra demonstrate that the CNPs have a very broad absorption spanning the entire UV–vis–NIR range. This is in a good agreement with previous data [43]. The absorption spectrum of as-prepared CNPs shows a strong absorption below 550 nm with a shoulder around 420 nm. This shoulder, the lowest energy exciton transition peak of CuS, is blue-shifted compared to bulk CuS (490 nm) due to quantum confinement effects of the smaller particle size [44]. Moreover, the spectrum shows a strong and very broad absorption in the near infrared region originating from the localized surface plasmon resonance of CNPs [45,46].
B. P3HT:PCBM:CuS active layers
Prior to building the entire devices, the active layers were characterized. Figure 2(a) shows an active layer structure used to evaluate the effect of the CNPs on OPV cell performance. To eventually incorporate the CNPs in the P3HT:PCBM active matrix, the as-prepared CNPs must be compatible with the matrix. To this end, the particles were hydrophobically modified by capping with OAm.
Figure 2(b) shows that the NPs have a high affinity to the OAm additive because after only 2–4 min the transfer from the more polar dispersant DMSO to the unpolar OAm is essentially complete. Figure 2(b) also shows that dispersions of the OAm-modified NPs are more stable than dispersions of the as-synthesized particles in CHB. While the as-prepared particles sediment after ca. 10 min, the dispersions of the OAm-modified particles in CHB are stable for up to 2 h.
Comparison of the FTIR spectra of pure OAm, as-prepared CNPs, and OAm-modified CNPs proves ligand capping of the CNPs, Fig. 2(c). Spectra obtained from the as-prepared CNPs do not show specific bands indicating that the NPs do not contain organic components such as residues from the ILs or (TMS)_{2}S [47–49]. However, the presence of OAm on the respective CNPs is indicated by the CH_{2} and CH_{3} symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations at 2857 and 2931 cm^{−1}, which are very weakly visible in the spectra of OAm-modified CNPs [50]. The bands do not shift compared to pure OAm; this indicates that the ligands are only weakly bound to the particles [25].
Figure 2(d) shows the UV–vis absorption spectra of CNPs. The CNPs capping with OAm result in minor spectral changes. The absorbance below 420 nm slightly increases, while the absorption in the region above 420 nm is less pronounced than in the as-prepared sample. Moreover, the shoulder at around 420 nm is blue-shifted by ca. 10 nm upon capping with OAm.
Figure 3(a) shows the effect of filtration on the optical properties of the OAm-modified CNP dispersion. The absorption spectrum of pure OAm dissolved in CHB shows an absorption only below 400 nm. This indicates that the absorbance at the lower wavelength originates from both the NPs and OAm. Accordingly, the spectra of the dispersions containing the as-prepared, unfiltered CNPs show a broad absorption essentially over the entire UV-vis-NIR range.
The spectra of dispersions made with the CNP samples filtered with 0.45 and 0.2 μm filters, respectively, are essentially identical. They show a strong absorption below 450 nm, but the signals previously observed above 450 nm are not visible anymore. The only remaining signal is a weak and broad band centered at around 650 nm.
The absorption above 450 nm in the spectra of the as-prepared samples has previously been observed in amorphous and bulk CuS [39,44,51]. It has been assigned to localized surface plasmon resonance of CNPs but also to particle aggregation. As a result, the disappearance of this signal after filtration shows that filtration efficiently removes large particles and aggregates present in the as-synthesized products. TEM (Fig. S1 of the supplementary material) indeed confirms a significant reduction of the particle size by filtration.
The remaining fraction of CuS nanoparticles was estimated by the change of absorbance after the filtration, based on Beer’s law. After filtration with a 0.2 μm PTFE filter, the absorbance at 420 nm decreases by ca. 69% indicating that only ca. 31% of the particles remain after filtration.
Bandgap estimations were done via Tauc-plots, Fig. 3(b). As-prepared CNPs have a bandgap of 2.3 eV, while samples filtered with 0.2 μm pore filters have a bandgap of 3.1 eV. The fact that the bandgap is larger after filtration with the 0.2 μm pore filter indicates that the filtration indeed removes larger particles and thus confirms TEM and absorption spectroscopy.
Figure 3(c) shows the photoelectron yield spectra of CNP films upon increasing UV excitation light energy. The valence band maximum (VBM), a measure of ionization energy (IE), is the onset of photoelectron emission, which is 4.8 and 5.3 eV for the OAm-modified unfiltered and filtered CNPs, respectively.
Figure 3(d) shows the resulting band diagram of the CNPs and their position relative to P3HT and PCBM. The energy levels of P3HT and PCBM were obtained from the literature [25]. According to the band diagram, the CNPs should be a good hole collection layer (HCL) material; they should also be a good electron blocking layer with a barrier of 0.8 eV between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of P3HT and the conduction band minimum (CBM) of the CNPs.
Finally, the morphology of the active P3HT:PCBM:CuS blend layer [Fig. 2(a)] was evaluated via AFM. Different preparation parameters were studied—mainly the ratios of the three components P3HT, PCBM, and CuS along with different filtration steps (no filtration vs. 0.45 μm vs. 0.2 μm PTFE filter).
Figure 4 shows the surface morphology of the resulting films. A P3HT:PCBM film without CNPs [Fig. 4(a)] where the blended solution was filtered with a 0.2 μm filter shows rather homogeneous films but has a root-mean-square roughness (R_{q}) and peak-to-valley roughness (R_{pv}) of 3.3 nm and 28.8 nm, respectively. The P3HT:PCBM:CuS blend film where the CNPs were filtered with a 0.45 μm filter [Fig. 4(b)] is very similar to the reference film but has a slightly higher roughness (i.e., R_{q} = 3.9 nm and R_{pv} = 31.0 nm).
In stark contrast to both films above, the P3HT:PCBM:CuS films produced with a 0.2 μm filter [Fig. 4(c)] are very homogeneous and show no protrusions, crazes, or other features. Consequently, the R_{q} and R_{pv} are only 1.4 nm and 11.1 nm, respectively. In addition, the P3HT:PCBM blend film produced with a 0.2 μm filter [Fig. 4(d)] has a slightly lower roughness (i.e., R_{q} = 1.1 nm and R_{pv} = 9.2 nm) than the P3HT:PCBM:CuS films produced with a 0.2 μm filter. Therefore, the surface roughness of the blend film where the CNPs were filtered with a 0.2 μm filter is smoother due to the fact that the larger particles in the P3HT:PCBM blend are removed. Overall, these results clearly show that the embedded CNPs do not significantly affect the film roughness compared to films prepared without CNPs.
C. P3HT:PCBM:CuS active layers in conventional and inverted devices
The potential of the CNPs as hole transport materials (i.e., p-type semiconductors) in the P3HT:PCBM:CuS active matrix was evaluated in both conventional and inverted OPV cells. Figure 5 shows the architecture of both devices and the corresponding band diagrams. The energy levels of ZnO NPs [37] and MoO_{3} [52] were obtained from the literature. In the following, the J-V characteristics of the devices shown in Fig. 5 were investigated. To that end, several devices with different architectures and compositions were made, Table I and Table S2 of the supplementary material.
Figure 6 shows the J-V characteristics of devices A to D, including the reference devices fabricated without CNPs, which are designed to investigate the role of CNPs in both conventional and inverted device architectures.
Figure 6(a) shows the data for the conventional devices. The reference device A (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/Ca/Ag) shows an S-shape (i.e., S-kink or double diode) J-V curve. S-kink J-V curves are normally observed in BHJ or flat heterojunction (FHJ) OPV cells with various drawbacks such as high energy barriers for carrier extraction and injection or an imbalance of charge carrier mobilities [53–55].
We assign this behavior to the combination of a 1:1 blending ratio of P3HT:PCBM and the high sheet resistance of ITO (50–70 ℧/sq) in the conventional device structure because the S-shape curve is not observed when the device is fabricated only with low sheet resistance (10–15 ℧/sq) and 1:0.8 blending ratio (Fig. S2a and Table S3 of the supplementary material). This suggests that the hole transport is delayed by the higher concentration of the PCBM acceptor material (i.e., electron transport material) and the high resistance of the anode. In addition, this reference structure provides good contact between the active layer and both the anode and the cathode (i.e., metal-semiconductor contact) by a PEDOT:PSS and Ca buffer layer, respectively. Therefore, control device A is a good reference to evaluate the effect of the CNPs on the hole transport properties.
Upon addition of the CNPs to the active matrix, the S-shape of the J-V curve of the conventional device A changes, Fig. 6(a). J_{sc} increases from 1.26 mA/cm^{2} (device A) to 2.68 mA/cm^{2} (device B) and the fill factor (FF) increases from 17.78% to 22.60%, respectively. Overall, this leads to an increase of power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 0.14% to 0.35%, Table S1 of the supplementary material.
Figure 6(b) shows the corresponding data for the inverted devices. A control device C (ITO/ZnO/P3HT:PCBM/Ag), designed without HCL, was chosen to determine if the CNPs could reduce V_{oc} by improving the contact property between the Ag cathode and the active layer. Consequently, Fig. 6(b) shows that a device D containing CNPs increases V_{oc} from 0.39 V to 0.56 V, which leads to an overall increase of the PCE from 0.39% to 0.49%, Table S1 of the supplementary material.
D. Efficiency enhancement by CNP concentration variation
To increase OPV performance in the conventional structures, different CNP concentrations were investigated, see Table I. The different CNP concentrations do not dramatically change the surface roughness of the active layer, but device G shows the lowest R_{q} and R_{pv} (i.e., 1.13 nm and 8.96 nm, respectively), Table S4 and Fig. S3 of the supplementary material. Device performance was not enhanced by the roughness, but the slightly different roughness, especially R_{pv}, brought only a minor difference in dark current measurements as shown in Fig. 7(b). This aspect will be discussed below.
Figure 7(a) shows the J-V characteristics of device E to device H under illumination; the corresponding OPV parameters are summarized in Table II. V_{oc} is almost identical at around 0.6 V for all devices. However, the change of J_{sc} strongly depends on the CNP concentration, with device G having the highest current density (J_{sc}) of 8.38 mA/cm^{2}. Even though the FF of the devices decreases from 46.64% to 43.72% as the CNP concentration increases from device E to device H, the P3HT:PCBM:CuS ratio of 1:0.8:0.2 (device G) consequently increases the PCE from 2.27% to 2.64% (i.e., by 16%) compared to the control device E. This is due to the highest J_{sc} in this sample. Table S5 of the supplementary material shows the complete results obtained from all devices with different pixel areas demonstrating a high reproducibility of these experiments and proving that the device performance shows the same trends.
Figure 7(b) shows the dark current (J_{dc}) characteristics of the devices with semi-log plots. The three indicated regions account for where different effects dominate: region I, region II, and region III account for leakage (i.e., shunt) currents, recombination currents, and series resistance, respectively [56,57]. Region II and III are quite similar for all devices. However, region I shows a different current density behavior. The shunt resistance (R_{sh}), correlated with the J-V curve slope of region I (i.e., R_{sh} ∼ 1/slope), is reduced when CNPs are embedded in the active layer compared to the control device; this leads to low FFs.
However, the different CNP concentrations do not significantly change the slope. Additionally, the level of current density in region I, which indicates the difference of leakage current in the devices, is lowest in device G. This low leakage current correlates with the higher J_{sc} and the lower surface roughness of the blended layer in device G (Table S4 of the supplementary material). Since the control device shows also a lower current density in region I compared to the other devices containing CNPs, the higher leakage currents is due to the presence of the CNPs.
IV. DISCUSSION
Semiconductor NP-based OPV cells are interesting for many applications, and although the general concept is well established, open questions remain. One of the open questions concerns the design of the perfect NPs for such devices, mainly in terms of chemical composition, shape, anisotropy, size, and size distributions. The current study addresses these questions via a novel synthetic process towards anisotropic CNPs that have so far not been used in OPV devices.
For application of covellite CNPs in OPV cells, the broad size distribution and the initially rather poor dispersibility of the as-prepared CNPs must be improved. Capping with OAm is a simple and highly successful approach towards stable dispersions. Additionally, filtration is a successful tool to remove larger particles and aggregates (Fig. 3 and Fig. S1 of the supplementary material). Filtration also improves the optical properties of the CNPs: the strong absorption below 450 nm and the weak and broad peak at 650 nm originate from the smaller size of the filtered CNPs, similar to previous examples [58,59]. In consequence, the particles obtained after filtration are interesting candidates for the active blend in OPV cells.
As a result of the favorable properties of the NPs, both the conventional and inverted OPV cells fabricated with the CNPs show a good performance comparable to the few existing examples so far [23–25]. First, p-type CNPs distributed in the BHJ active layer of the conventional devices [Fig. 6(a)] modify the J-V curve and enhance the device performance. These improvements are due to an increased carrier mobility by (i) additional interfacial area between the CNPs and the conjugated polymers and (ii) the high hole mobility of the CuS single crystal structure; the latter is particularly pronounced because of the high crystallinity of the CNPs used in the current study. These assignments are consistent with simulation and experimental data [55,60].
Second, V_{oc} significantly improves from 0.42 to 0.57 V upon embedding the CNPs in the active layer of the inverted devices [Fig. 6(b)]. In general, V_{oc} is not only limited by the effective bandgap (i.e., energy level difference between the acceptor LUMO and donor HOMO, V_{oc} ≈ E_{LUMO(A)} − E_{HOMO(D)}) but also by the contact property between the metal and semiconductor in OPV cells [61–64]. Here, the increased effective bandgap of CuS/PCBM to 1 eV in P3HT:PCBM:CuS blend compared to the 0.8 eV from P3HT:PCBM is responsible for the improved V_{oc}.
In addition, the hole contact property of the CNPs improves V_{oc}. When an additional MoO_{3} HCL is applied in the inverted control device between the active layer and the anode (i.e., ITO/ZnO/P3HT:PCBM/MoO_{3}/Ag, Fig. S2b and Table S3 of the supplementary material), both V_{oc} and J_{sc} increase, proving the hole contact property of the MoO3 layer. Indeed, similar to the MoO_{3} HCL, the CNP layer has the same effect and increases V_{oc} by modifying the contact between the active layer and the Ag anode. On the other hand, some of the CNPs distributed in the P3HT:PCBM:CuS matrix will not necessarily be in direct contact with the Ag anode in device C. Since this device has no other hole-extracting layer like an MoO_{3} layer, some of the holes may be trapped or recombine again with electrons. This leads to a slightly lower J_{sc} in device D compared to the device C fabricated without CNPs. The improved contact property by the CNPs is consistent with the literature [25] and also confirmed by our experiments (Fig. S4 and Table S6 of the supplementary material). The current study in fact confirms the earlier findings for more complex architectures. As a result, the current data prove that CNPs synthesized from ILPs are efficient p-type semiconductors leading to improved OPV cell performance.
Next, the data show a strong dependence of the device performance on CNP concentration in the conventional OPVs (Fig. 7). Specifically, the increased J_{sc} is attributed to the enhanced carrier mobility in the active matrix by the CNPs. However, the lower FF may originate from the enhanced carrier recombination rate with the increased hole mobility, or interface defects, which may be more pronounced at higher CNP concentration. High carrier mobilities can facilitate the exciton dissociation and transport, but they can also increase the recombination rate of carriers [65]. Overall, the data show that the reason for the almost constant V_{oc} is that the Ca layer already provides good contact properties between the Ag and active layer.
Finally, the dark J-V characteristic [Fig. 7(b)] shows a higher leakage current in device H than in device G; this is confirmed by the normalized absorption curves from active blend films (Fig. S5 of the supplementary material). We assign the distinctly increased absorbance at wavelengths longer than 700 nm to particle agglomeration, which is more pronounced at higher CNP concentration. Therefore, the agglomeration of CNPs could be a leakage path in the BHJ at higher CNP concentrations. The decreased additional interfacial area between CNPs and polymer matrix by the particle agglomeration could be another reason of low performance of this device.
V. CONCLUSION
Overall, the current article shows that hexagonal covellite CNPs made from the ionic liquid precursor [C_{12}Py]_{2}[CuCl_{4}] are viable candidates for the fabrication of OPV devices. Especially the simple synthesis and the straightforward modification with OAm and purification by filtration make them prime candidates for advanced optical devices. Embedding CNPs in the active matrix of P3HT:PCBM using both conventional and inverted structures leads to an improved OPV performance through the presence of the p-type semiconductor CNPs. Moreover, the reduced contact resistance between the anode and organic semiconductor layer and the increased effective bandgap by the CNPs increases the overall OPV cell performance. As a result, the optimized blend ratio of P3HT:PCBM:CuS shows an increase in the PCE of 16% when compared to control devices made without CNPs. In addition, the broad absorption of CNPs, even in the NIR region, indicates that the CNPs could be interesting donor materials via proper bandgap tuning.
