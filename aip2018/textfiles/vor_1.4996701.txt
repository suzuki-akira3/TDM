Investigation on heat transfer analysis and its effect on a multi-mode, beam-wave interaction for a 140 GHz, MW-class gyrotron
The interaction cavity of a 140 GHz, 1 MW continuous wave gyrotron developed in UESTC will be loaded with a very large heat load in the inner surface during operation. In order to reduce the heat, the axial wedge grooves of the outside surface of the cavity are considered and employed as the heat radiation structure. Thermoanalysis and structural analysis were discussed in detail to obtain the effects of heat on the cavity. In thermoanalysis, the external coolant-flow rates ranging from 20 L/min to 50 L/min were considered, and the distribution of wall loading was loaded as the heat flux source. In structural analysis, the cavity's deformation caused by the loads of heat and pressure was calculated. Compared with a non-deformed cavity, the effects of deformation on the performance of a cavity were discussed. For a cold-cavity, the results show that the quality factor would be reduced by 72, 89, 99 and 171 at the flow rates of 50 L/min, 40 L/min, 30 L/min and 20 L/min, respectively. Correspondingly, the cold-cavity frequencies would be decreased by 0.13 GHz, 0.15 GHz, 0.19 GHz and 0.38 GHz, respectively. For a hot-cavity, the results demonstrate that the output port frequencies would be dropped down, but the offset would be gradually decreased with increasing coolant-flow rate. Meanwhile, the output powers would be reduced dramatically with decreasing coolant-flow rate. In addition, when the coolant-flow rate reaches 40 L/min, the output power and the frequency are just reduced by 30 kW and 0.151 GHz, respectively.
I. INTRODUCTION
Gyro-devices are important microwave devices that can provide high power and high frequency microwaves, in which a ring-shaped gyrating electron beam interacts with a TE transverse eigenmode of a cylindrical (single, complex), coaxial, confocal or photonic bandgap cavity resonator [1–4]. Among the existing gyro-devices, a gyrotron oscillator is a reliable and considerable source to produce high power both in pulse and continuous modes for millimeter waves and terahertz waves, which have been applied in a variety of systems including radars, materials processing and medical imaging [5]. Especially, in plasma experiments relevant to magnetic confinement fusion research, gyrotrons are used as efficient, high frequency (100–300 GHz) RF sources for Electron Cyclotron Resonance Heating and Current Drive (ECRH & CD) systems [6]. Presently, in the Experiment, Advanced, Superconducting and Tokamak (EAST) in Hefei (China), a 140 GHz/4 MW ECRH project has been developed [7]. For ECRH & CD applications in the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) in France, 24 MW of long-pulse (∼3600 s) RF power at 170 GHz is needed, which is planned to be generated from a 24 ×1MW gyrotron system [8–11]. After successful operation of the ITER, a demonstration (DEMO) power plant is planned as the first prototype of commercial fusion power plants [12], such as the Chinese Fusion Engineering Testing Reactor (CFETR), is being developed [13,14]. The expected output power per gyrotron is about 1 MW in the case of a traditional cylindrical-cavity gyrotron [15,16]. Meanwhile, for the generation of 2 MW of output power a coaxial-cavity gyrotron is being analyzed and designed at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) (Germany) [17]. With the gyrotron operating at a high power level, the temperature of the cavity will become high, which will deform the cavity and then influence the performances of the gyrotron. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze in detail the thermodynamics and structural mechanics of the cavity of a high power gyrotron.
A 140 GHz MW-class gyrotron is being developed for many years at the KIT (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology) [18,19], CPI (Communications & Power Industries) [20], and IAP RAS (Institute of Applied Physics of Russian Academy of Sciences) [21]. This paper demonstrates the thermal and structural analyses of the cavity of a 140 GHz MW-class gyrotron developed in the UESTC, in which the Fluent and Static Structural of ANSYS software are used, respectively. In thermal analysis, the distribution of the wall loading was used as the heat flux source, and the coolant-flow rates ranging from 20 L/min to 50 L/min were considered. In the structural analysis, the simulation results of the thermal analysis were employed to calculate the cavity's deformation. After completing the structural analysis, the effects of deformation on the cold and hot cavities were discussed by using the in-house developed multi-mode, self-consistent, time-dependent code GYSIC, which is based on Refs [22–26].
This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, the basic design of the cavity is presented. Meanwhile, the ohmic wall loading is calculated under different conductivities for the main mode. In Sec. III, the thermal and structural analyses are demonstrated by using ANSYS software. In Sec. IV, the effects of deformation on the cold and hot cavities are discussed by using GYSIC. Finally, a conclusion is included in Sec. V.
II. CAVITY DESIGN, MULTI-MODE SIMULATION AND WALL LOSS ANALYSIS
A. Cold cavity geometry and multi-mode, self-consistent interaction simulation
As the TE_{28.8} mode has been used successfully in the MW-class gyrotron [19], TE_{28.8} is selected as the operating mode here. The designed parameters are listed in Table I for the gyrotrons developed herein and in Ref [19]. The gyrotron RF interaction cavity used and the normalized field profile are plotted in Fig. 1, where L_{1} = 15 mm, L_{2} = 14.5 mm, L_{3} = 40 mm, L_{4} = 10 mm, S_{1} = 4 mm, S_{2} = 5.4 mm, S_{3} = 16 mm, α = 2.3°, β = 2.0°. For the main mode, the corresponding cold cavity resonant angular frequency ω_{cut}≅2π×140.19043GHz is obtained.
Based on the results of the cold-cavity, the multi-mode beam-wave interaction has been analyzed by using GYSIC, in which the complex transverse wave number was considered for considering the effects of ohmic losses in the simulation. Meanwhile, in order to save the real-time of simulation, we employed two time-saving techniques and three assumptions. Firstly, in the start-up scenarios, we began our simulations at a beam voltage of 31 kV (rather than zero), choosing the initial voltage to be slightly below the voltage at which the modes' growth rates become positive. In the start-up scenarios, the beam current and the velocity change with the beam voltage. For the beam current, it can be calculated as [27]
Here, I_{op} and V_{anodeop} are the designed operating current and anode voltage, respectively. V_{anode} is the anode voltage, which changes with the time of the start-up, and Vanode=Vbeam+I{beam}60Ωβ_{z0}ln(R_{c}R_{e}) when considering space-charge effects [28], where β_{z0} is the axial velocity, V_{beam} is the beam voltage, Rc and Re are the cavity radius and the outer beam radius, respectively. T is the cathode temperature in K. The velocity ratio change with the voltage is based on the adiabatic approximation in Ref [28]. Second, we divided the voltage rise into 2 kV steps, simulating the mode evolution at each voltage value for 100 ns. Third, we assumed that the extended beam-wave interaction region magnetic field profile is a constant value. Fourth, we selected the competition modes that the eigenvalues of the modes are nearby the main mode (μ_{mp}−μ_{43.15}≤2.5, where μ_{mp} represents the eigenvalues of competition modes), and the beam-wave coefficients of competition modes are greater than 60%. Lastly, we assumed an ideal electron beam in the simulation.
As a next step, in the simulations, an updated conductivity σ_{cu}=1.9×10^{7}S/m, was employed, the time step of 0.02 ns was selected, the space step of 0.1 mm was used, and the powers of 0.01 mW of the excitation signal for every mode were set, which are ten orders smaller than the power of coherent radiation in the steady-state regime [29]. At the same time, the relativistic cyclotron frequency when an electron enters the interaction cavity was selected as the averaging frequency Ω{f} (i.e., Ω{f}=ηB_{∥}/γ(t_{0}), where η is the charge-to-mass ratio, B_{∥} is the external DC magnetic field value, γ(t_{0}) is the initial electron relativity factor) and the cold-cavity resonant frequencies of every mode were employed as the carrier frequencies ω{mn}. Based on the above discussions, the start-up scenario is displayed in Fig. 2, in which the beam energy increases from 31 kV to 81 kV till 2500 ns and remains constant till 3700 ns. As it shows, the stable RF output of 1 MW with an electronic efficiency of 29.2% and an output port frequency of 140.229 GHz have been achieved for the main mode.
B. Cavity wall loss analysis
The study of the problem of wall losses is important for long pulses for the CW operation of high power gyrotrons since the problem of cooling depends on the local wall loading as well as the total losses. The distribution of wall loading is given by Ref [30] as
In the calculation of the wall losses, Glidcop was selected as the updated copper. Based on Refs [16] and  [31–33], when considering the effect of the cavity wall surface roughness and the temperature of 270 °C, the σ_{eff,Glidcop}=1.9×10^{7}S/m was selected as the effective conductivity of Glidcop at the RMS height of the rough surface profile of 1.0 μm. According to Eq. (2), we calculated the distributions of wall loading for the updated copper and ideal copper (σ_{cu}=5.7×10^{7}S/m), in which the final fields' distributions of the TE_{+28.8} mode calculated by GYSIC were used. The results are plotted in Fig. 3. It shows that the maximum value of wall loading is close to 1.6 kW/cm^{2} for σ_{cu}=1.9×10^{7}S/m, and is about 0.85 kW/cm^{2} for ideal copper. Although the ideal copper exhibits good low ohmic wall loading characteristic, it is under the room temperature condition, which cannot satisfy the real experimental situation.
III. HEAT TRANSFER ANALYSIS
In this part, with the help of ANSYS software, the thermal and structural analyses of the cavity have been presented. In that, the cavity with the external heat radiation structure consisting of 40 uniform axial wedge grooves is considered, which is plotted in Fig. 4, where the height of the grooves is d =3.5 mm. In the analyses, thermoanalysis by using the Computational Fluid Dynamics method with the help of Fluent was discussed, and Static Structural was employed for analyzing the deformation on the cavity. As the model described in Fig. 4 is a rotational symmetric model, a single groove demonstrated in Fig. 5 was selected as the simulation domain in Fluent in order to reduce the mesh quantity and then to reduce the computational cost.
In Fluent simulation, a three-dimensional, steady state with pressure-based solver was employed. The method of patch conforming tetrahedrons was selected for meshes. For the above-mentioned meshes, the average values of the skewness and the aspect ratio were 0.21 and 1.81, respectively. Meanwhile, the maximum values of the skewness and the aspect ratio were 0.85 and 10.9, respectively. The multi-phase of the volume of fluid (VOF) model was employed for the boiling case, in which the primary phase of water-liquid and the secondary phase of water-vapor were used. For the viscous case, the standard κ−ε turbulence model with enhanced wall treatment was selected. Based on the descriptions of Ref [33], the temperature-dependent material properties of the updated copper were considered. For the boundary conditions, the “wall” boundary loaded the wall-loading distribution described in Fig. 3, for the updated copper was employed in the inner surface of the cavity, the “velocity-inlet” boundary was selected for the inlet surface, the “pressure-outlet” boundary was used for the outlet surface, and the default boundaries were employed for other surfaces. After the above setting, the simulations have been done with considering the coolant flow rates of 0.5 L/min, 0.75 L/min, 1 L/min and 1.25 L/min whose corresponding flow rates of total grooves are 20 L/min, 30 L/min, 40 L/min and 50 L/min, respectively. The simulation results for temperature distributions, pressure drops, and velocity fields of the fluid at different rates are demonstrated in Fig. 6–8, respectively. The figures demonstrate that the maximum temperature values are 356.2 °C, 276.8 °C, 262.3 °C, and 254.2 °C for the rates of 20 L/min, 30 L/min, 40 L/min, and 50 L/min, respectively. Correspondingly, the pressure drops are 1185.5 Pa, 4334.3 Pa, 6513.2 Pa, and 9430.8 Pa, respectively. From the results, we can find that the maximum temperature can be controlled at about 276.8 °C or less, when the water flow rate reaches about 30 L/min or more.
After thermal analysis, the deformations on the cavity have been calculated with the help of Static Structural, in which the results of pressure fields of the interfaces of fluid-solid and the temperature distributions of the cavity body were used as the load sources. In the simulation of Static Structural, the cavity was assembled between the beam tunnel and the launcher of the quasi-optical, and the cavity with grooves was selected as the simulation region. Therefore, the two surfaces located at the input and output ports of the cavity were considered as the fixation boundaries in the axial direction. In addition, the total structure (cavity with 40 grooves) was considered by using cyclic symmetry, in which a new cylindrical coordinate system was established, and then the two side faces (radial surfaces) of the single groove were selected as the cyclic regions (one was defined as the Low and the other was defined as the High). For the meshing method, the tetrahedra were used. Regarding the material properties of the updated copper, the density of 8810 kg/m^{3}, the modulus of elasticity of 130 GPa, and other temperature-dependent variables were considered based on the descriptions of Ref [33]. The simulation results for the deformations of the cavity inner radius at different coolant-flow rates are plotted in Fig. 9.
IV. THE EFFECTS OF CAVITY DEFORMATION
In the above discussions, the thermal and structural analyses have been discussed and presented. In Fig. 9, we can see that the cavity has undergone different deformations under the conditions of different coolant-flow rates. For different deformations, the cavity will present different performances in the cold-cavity and the hot-cavity. For the cold-cavity, the diffraction quality factors, the resonator frequencies, and the electric field profiles for different deformed cavities and the initial cavity are demonstrated in Fig. 10. As it shows, the diffraction quality factor, the resonant frequency and the electric field profile change due to the deformation.
After studying the cold-cavity, the multi-mode self-consistent beam-wave interactions have been simulated by using GYSIC for different deformed cavities. In order to compare with the initial condition, the start-up setting and the selected operating point of the deformed cavities are the same as that of the initial condition. The start-up scenarios for different deformed cavities are depicted in Figs. 11–14, respectively. The figures show that the operating mode TE_{+28.8} can finally reach the steady state in all cavities. The output powers, oscillator frequencies, and peak ohmic loadings are summarized in Table II for different deformed cavities and the initial cavity.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, the thermal and structural investigations on the cavity of a 140 GHz gyrotron are discussed in detail. For the cavity, the multi-mode self-consistent time-dependent beam-wave interaction has been simulated by GYSIC. In the simulations, a conductivity of 1.9×10^{7}S/m is considered, and the beam voltage of 81 kV, the beam current of 43.2 A, the velocity ratio of 1.2, the guiding center radius of 10.17 mm, and the DC-magnetic of 5.615 T are selected as the operating point. At this operating point, the output power of 1 MW has been reached for the non-deformed cavity. As the gyrotron will operate under the conditions of the long-pulse and MW-class, the temperature of the cavity can reach several hundred Celsius degrees or more, which will lead to the deformation of the cavity. The deformed cavity will result in changes in the quality factor, the resonator frequency and the field distribution of the cold-cavity, and then bring the effects of the gyrotron in the operating frequency and power. Therefore, it is necessary and important to do thermal and structural analyses for the cavity. Herein, the thermal analysis has been discussed by the computational fluid dynamics method with the help of Fluent, and then the structural analysis has been done with the help of Static Structural and by employing the simulation results of Fluent. In the analyses, the loaded coolant-flow rates ranging from 20 L/min to 50 L/min were considered. In Fluent, temperature distributions of the cavity body, and the pressure drops and velocity fields of the fluid at different coolant-flow rates were calculated and obtained. In Static structural, the deformations at different coolant-flow rates were obtained. By using the above results, the effects of deformations on the performances of cavity have been analyzed. Compared with the initial condition (non-deformed), for the cold-cavity, when considering the coolant-flow rates of 50 L/min, 40 L/min, 30 L/min and 20 L/min, the diffraction quality factor would be reduced by 72, 89, 99 and 171, respectively. At the same time, the cold-cavity frequency would be decreased by 0.13 GHz, 0.15 GHz, 0.19 GHz and 0.38 GHz, respectively. For the hot-cavity, the results demonstrate that the output port frequency would be dropped down, but the offset would be gradually decreased with increasing coolant-flow rate. Meanwhile, the output power would be reduced more with decreasing coolant-flow rate. In summary, it can be seen from the results that when the loaded coolant-flow rate reaches 30 L/min or higher, the output power can reach over 900 kW and the output port frequency can be kept above 140 GHz.
