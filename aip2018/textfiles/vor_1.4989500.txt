Temporally and spatially resolved ion dynamics of droplet-based laser-produced tin plasmas in lateral expansion direction
The temporal and spatial plasma ion dynamics in the lateral direction generated by a Nd:YAG laser irradiated droplet target were studied with a hemispherical electrostatic probe array. The ion dynamics produced from 1.6 × 10^{+11 }W/cm^{2} irradiation with a pulse duration of 23.9 ns FWHM were measured simultaneously from 50° to 130° from the laser axis with radial probe distances d from 1.5 to 7 cm to the plasma ignition point at an ambient argon gas pressure of 2 × 10^{−2} mbar. The collected ion charge and expansion velocities were derived from the ion profiles. It was found that the collected ion charge Q around the droplet scales with Q ∼ d^{−}^{2} indicating that the main driving mechanism relates to the three-dimensional plasma expansion and not recombination processes. An anisotropic ion bulk expansion in the laser forward and backward propagation direction was deduced ranging from 2.9 cm/μs to 2.1 cm/μs, respectively. The gradients of the ion bulk expansion velocities along d were found to be constant within the error margin across the measurement range. The leading edge of the ion profiles showed an anisotropic behavior around the droplet, suggesting recombination effects scale differently in the laser forward and backward propagation direction which was linked to the higher expansion velocities in the laser forward direction. The broadening of the ion current waveform with increasing radial distance was studied and it was observed that the ion profile shape did not change for d > 5 cm, suggesting negligible recombination.
I. INTRODUCTION
In the field of nanolithography and metrology, laser power densities in the range of 10^{+11 }W/cm^{2} are used to produce plasmas with photon emission in the soft X-ray region. The most commonly used wavelength is the region of extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) radiation in particular, the wavelength centered at 13.5 nm, within a 2% bandwidth, which is determined by the EUV reflective optics [1]. These Bragg reflective optics typically consist of alternating layers of silicon and molybdenum, so called multi-layer (ML) optics. EUV light sources are mainly studied for next generation lithography and metrology systems [2]. Target materials of interest for EUV light production are tin, xenon, and lithium. The most studied target material is tin because of the high conversion efficiency in combination with the safe and comparably simple handling.
Typical targets in current EUV sources are micrometer-scale tin droplets generated by the break-up of a liquid jet [3]. These micrometer-sized tin droplets are irradiated by the excitation source at the focus volume. In the first nanoseconds, the target material evaporates creating a high density region where most of the incoming photons are absorbed through inverse bremsstrahlung [4]. The electrons gain energy from the laser beam leading to an increase of the ionization degree. A plasma is formed consisting of charged particles expanding with velocities up to tens of cm/μs. These ions eventually reach the EUV collecting optics resulting in a reflectivity degradation through erosion and coating processes compromising the lifetime of the EUV light sources. To decrease the ion load on the EUV reflecting optics for future laser-produced plasma (LPP) EUV sources, it is of fundamental importance to study the ion expansion in its temporal and spatial behavior for mass-limited droplet targets.
Studies on the kinetic energy and ion charges in space from EUV radiating tin plasmas were conducted mostly on slab targets [5–10]. The influence of inertial background gas [11,12], electrostatic, and electromagnetic deflectors [13,14] was published for EUV emitting tin plasmas on flat targets.
Implications of the spherical shape and the limited target mass are not treated for slab target studies. More recent publications show the effect of droplet targets on the ion emission. The anisotropic ion behavior for droplet targets is treated for a single distance representative for an EUV collector placement by means of an electrostatic analyser [15] for a single pulse irradiation scheme and Faraday cups (FCs) with a multiple pulse irradiation scheme [16,17]. Fujioka et_al studied the ion charge and kinetic energy for 500 μm tin coated plastic micro-balloons with a Thomson parabola ion analyzer and a single FC [18]. Shimomura et_al published the effects of a debris mitigation strategy including ion mitigation schemes with minimum-mass tin targets [19]. First results of the spatial distribution of the ion kinetic energy were shown by Gambino et_al [20] with a Langmuir probe array and Nakamura et_al [16] with a single FC for three points in space with a double irradiation scheme.
The time-space domain of the ionic population is well studied for stationary slab targets, whereas, the peculiarities of the ion distribution in time and space for spherical droplet targets with a limited mass is not yet fully understood. The angular distribution as a function of distance needs to be studied to predict the ion load at typical distances representative for EUV collectors at different lateral positions. The angular ion distribution as a function of distance in the centimeter range is important because most of the recombination takes place in this plasma density-temperature space for Nd:YAG irradiated targets. Another intricacy of droplet targets is the positioning of the micrometer-sized droplets in a repeatable manner with respect to the laser focus volume. Thus, measuring the ion dynamics simultaneously with multiple probes avoids plasma pulse-to-pulse variations around the droplet target compared to single probe measurements and therefore resolves the ion dynamics in the lateral direction in one measurement.
The structure of this paper is as follows: in Sec. II, the theory relevant to this work is presented including the electrostatic probe theory and the introduction of a numerical model, followed by the methods in Sec. III comprising the experimental set-up and the post-processing methodology. The results and discussion are presented in Sec. IV including the ion expansion dynamics and the discussion of the electrostatic acceleration coupled with recombination. Finally, the conclusion of this work is presented in Sec. V.
II. THEORY
A. Electrostatic probe theory
Electrostatic probes have the advantage of a simple electrical and mechanical design consisting essentially of a cylindrical wire exposed to the plasma biased with a positive or negative potential versus the plasma. The bias voltage V_{0} defines the attraction of positively charged or negatively charged particles. These kinds of probes have a virtue over all other diagnostic techniques: they are able to perform local measurements [21]. One of the penalties of the probe simplicity is associated to the plasma boundary represented by the probe surface. Close to the probe surface, the equations governing the motion of the plasma change, due to probe perturbation on the plasma expansion. The quasi-neutrality of the plasma is not valid close to the plasma boundary. This non-neutral local region between the probe and the plasma end is called the sheath. The sheath forms around any electrode in a plasma in case the bias voltage V_{0} differs from the plasma potential V_{p}. Since the probe electrode has a different potential than the plasma potential, the electrons or ions distribute spatially around the electrode surface to shield the effect of the bias voltage V_{0} on the plasma to reestablish quasi-neutrality [20]. Furthermore, there exists a transition layer between the neutral plasma and the sheath which is called the pre-sheath to allow ion flux continuity. Different probe theories have been developed for different plasma regimes, in density and temperature, as well as different probe shapes (cylindrical, spherical or planar). The applicable theory is chosen based on the parameters: mean free path λ_{ii,ei}, Debye length λ_{D}, and sheath thickness h. These three parameters scale with the plasma parameters. The necessary condition to apply the collision-less thin sheath theory to evaluate the ion density is based on the mean free path, the probe diameter D_{p} and the sheath thickness as follows:
In this relation, λ_{ii,ei} is the ion-ion and electron ion mean free path and h stands for the sheath thickness. The Debye length, λ_{D} in cm, is defined by
Here, the vacuum permittivity ε_{0} is given in F/cm, the Boltzmann constant k_{B} is given in J/K, the electron charge e is given in C, the electron temperature T_{e} is given in eV, and the electron density n_{e} is given in cm^{−3}. By assuming a constant ion density within the sheath, the matrix sheath thickness h is estimated by [22]
V_{0} is the applied probe potential with respect to the plasma potential given in V. Dividing the particle velocity with the collision frequency results in the mean free path for ion-ion collisions. Zel'dovič and Raizer [23] gave an estimate for the mean free path of charged particles, where n denotes the plasma density in cm^{−3}
The mean free paths for electron-ion λ_{ei} and electron-electron λ_{ee} are of the same size but two orders of magnitude larger than the ion-ion collisions. Therefore, the ion-ion mean free path is calculated based on the aforementioned relation. The ion-ion mean free path λ_{ii} at the core of the plasma, right after the laser pulse, is a few micrometers. The plasma density scales down, mainly through plasma expansion, by several orders of magnitude within few microseconds thereby the mean free path increases. At a plasma dimension in the range of centimeters, the ion-ion mean free path increases to hundreds of centimeters justifying the collisionless assumption for the considered measurement range. This rapid expansion after the laser pulse decreases the ion density from 10^{19} cm^{−3} by several orders of magnitude to n_{i} < 10^{13} cm^{−3} at distances larger than 2 cm from the plasma irradiation point. The temperature of the plasma, due to the recombination processes, decreases only from 30 to 40 eV during laser irradiation down to several eV in the considered measurement range [10,24]. The sheath thickness expands with decreasing density up to a point where the thin sheath theory is not applicable anymore (around d = 6 cm). For the limiting thin sheaths case for dense plasmas at distances d < 6 cm, all ions impact on the probe surface and the ion saturation current I_{Sat} is calculated according to the following relation:
In this equation, αn = n_{s} is the ion density at the sheath edge, with α ≈ 0.5. The exact value of α depends on the conditions in the presheath [25].n_{i} is the ion density, A_{P} is the probe collection surface projected onto the plasma flow direction, and v is normally the Bohm velocity as proposed by Chen [25]. However, for LPP plasmas the plasma flow velocity is supersonic and therefore greater than the Bohm velocity. For this reason, instead of the Bohm velocity, the plasma flow velocity should be used in Eq. (5) as proposed by Doggett and Lunney [22]. The flow velocities are determined by the probe-target distance divided by the ion arrival time from the time-of-flight (TOF). This velocity includes a velocity drift term which accounts for Coulomb electric fields accelerating the ions and the forward peaked expansion [26]. Typical ion flow velocities for LPPs range between 1 to 20 cm/μs demonstrating the character introduced by the Coulomb electric field. In the aforementioned relation, only singly charged ions are considered.
B. Numerical model
The essential feature of this model is the solution of the gas-dynamic equations for density and temperature [27] with the ions modeled as expanding from the laser absorption region with the measured mean expansion velocities. The absorption region was calculated based on the uniform temperature model of the plasma expansion during the laser pulse in combination with the inverse bremsstrahlung absorption coefficient. The isothermal equations, derived in the work of Singh and Narayan [4], were solved with a fourth order Runge-Kutta solver and the absorption region was calculated as the region where 99% of the laser intensity is absorbed. The boundary conditions for the calculation of the absorption region were based on the values proposed for the EUV dominant region by Ando et_al [28] and Burdt et_al [10] as follows: n_{e0} = 10^{20} cm^{−3} and the initial temperature T_{e0} = 30–40 eV with a mean charge state of Z¯ = 12.8 calculated with the collisional radiative model in its stationary limits which is introduced below. The ion expansion defines the region where the plasma density is modeled as an ellipsoid, with semi-axes of b/a = 0.8, expanding with the local ion speed of sound until a minimum velocity a_{p} = 0.91 cm/μs is reached as proposed in the work of Giovannini et_al [15] The mass conservation within is ensured during the whole simulation being equal the ablated mass m_{abl}̇ which was also modelled as suggested by Burdt et_al [5] as
In this relation, I_{a} is the power density at the focus, λ_{L} is the laser wavelength, Z_{a} is the atomic number of tin, and A_{irr} is the projected irradiated tin surface. In the initial stage, collisions between charged particles and neutrals are frequent and the mean charge state Z¯ establishes as a result of ionization and recombination processes. Once the laser irradiation ends, the only ionization mechanism is electron impact ionization. Through plasma cooling, the ionization rates decay rapidly and become negligible at electron temperatures T_{e} much less than the first ionization potential I_{1} = 7.34 eV. Both, ionization and recombination are modeled with the collisional-radiative model in its stationary limit as presented by Colombant and Tonon [29], where the ion number density n at charge Z is calculated as follows:
where S(Z,T_{e}) is the collisional ionization coefficient, α_{r}(Z,T_{e}) is the radiative-recombination coefficient, and α_{3b}(Z,T_{e}) is the three-body recombination coefficient. The recombination rate is strongly dependent on the density-temperature space, whereby the radiative recombination drops faster with plasma cooling than the three-body recombination. Eventually, the three-body recombination dominates since it scales with T_{e}^{−9/2} if
Once the three-body recombination dominates, the mean charge rate change dZ¯dt depends on the electron density n_{e}, the mean charge state Z¯, and the electron temperature T_{e} as follows [23]:
Recombination reduces the mean charge state Z¯ and results in the transfer of energy, which reduces the rate of decay in electron temperature T_{e}. In comparison with the adiabatic case, the plasma cooling takes place slower if the energy release through recombination is considered. The energy balance considers the addition in internal energy from the recombination, which contributes to the expansion work. The energy balance considering the gain in energy E^{*} from the recombination reads as follows [23]:
In the aforementioned equations, ε = 3/2(1 + Z)k_{B}T denotes the internal energy, p = N(1 + Z)k_{B}T is the pressure in the plasma, and v = 1/N is the specific volume, with N being the number of particles. A similar numerical model was introduced in the work of Giovannini et_al [15] In this work, the implemented model supports the experimental data and qualitatively explains the plasma expansion, including the plasma rarefaction, cooling, and recombination processes in the centimeter range.
III. METHODS
A. Experimental set-up
The plasma creation took place in a rectangular vacuum chamber, schematically represented in Fig. 1, in an argon background gas with a static pressure p_{s} = 2 × 10^{−2} mbar. A droplet dispenser mounted vertically above the laser focus on a motion stage dispensed the droplet target as shown in Fig. 1(a) The regenerative targets from the droplet dispenser were highly coherent, monodispersed tin droplets created by the breakup of a tin jet by means of an actuated excitation system. The tin droplets had an average diameter of 60 μm with a typical uncertainty of ±3% [3]. The droplets were positioned with respect to the laser focal volume with a motion control system. This motion system uses optical sensors and real time controllers to detect the droplet position in space to compensate for spatial droplet instabilities in the horizontal plane (lateral instabilities). The spatial resolution in the horizontal plane achievable with this control system is ±5 μm [30]. The positioning of the tin droplet perpendicular to the laser axis was implemented by a laser trigger system. The achievable temporal resolution is of ±1 μs. The laser beam line was sent into the vacuum chamber through a lens tube with a plano-convex lens, depicted in Fig. 1(b). The Gaussian beam diameter at the focus is 85 μm full width at half maximum (FWHM). A high repetition Nd:YAG laser was used and operated at a frequency of 6 kHz. The peak irradiance at the laser focus spot was 1.6 × 10^{+11 }W/cm^{2} with a pulse energy of E_{p} ≈ 0.2 J and a pulse duration at FWHM of t_{pulse} = 23.9 ns. The pulse-to-pulse variations of the laser pulse peak power were measured to be within σ_{L} < 1.9%. Each laser pulse was detected by a high-speed photodetector located outside the vacuum vessel to be able to temporally synchronize the acquired ion and EUV signals. The EUV signals were acquired with a sensor placed inside the vacuum chamber at a distance d of 50 cm and a lateral angle of γ = 75.2° within the horizontal plane schematically represented in Fig. 1(b). The EUV sensor consisted of a photodiode with a band-pass filter of 11 to 18 nm including an aperture. The diode creates a photo current which results in a voltage pulse when measured across a resistor. This voltage signal was post-processed by a fast integrator chip for each plasma to be correlated with the ion signals.
The ions were analyzed with a hemispherical electrostatic probe array detector. The design and its working principle are presented in detail in the work of Gambino et_al [20] The essential feature of this diagnostic tool is a multiple array of six motorized cylindrical electrostatic probes with a movement range of 1 to 10 cm in radial distance from the plasma site. The probe array is arranged symmetrically around the plasma in the vacuum chamber with a negative azimuthal angle ϕ = 112.5°, as depicted in Fig. 1(a). The six electrostatic probes span a lateral angular range of γ from 50° to 130° with a separation angle of 16°. The core of each probe consists of a cylindrical tungsten wire housed by a ceramic cylinder. The tungsten tip dimensions are D_{P} = 0.03 cm and L_{P} = 0.5 cm in diameter and length, respectively. In this case, the theory of infinite cylinders is applicable since the probe radius R_{p} < L. The diameter of the probe was chosen to satisfy D_{P} > λ_{D} in order to operate the probes in the quasi-neutral density regime. The ion probes were electrically isolated with respect to the chamber at saturation in the electron-repelling regime with a negative V_{0} = 30 V bias charge. The bias voltage set to operate in saturation in the electron-repelling regime was based on an earlier study [31]. The applied voltage was limited to a negative V_{0} = 30 V bias to avoid probe discharges governed by the Paschen law. Since the chamber is electrically grounded, floating means the probes were electrically isolated from the chamber. The EUV, ion, and photodiode signals were measured with a digitizer acquisition card with 12-Bit resolution and a real-time sampling capability of 60 MS/s. All signals were acquired with 50 Ω channel impedance. The bias circuit used in this study to operate the ion probes was discussed in detail in a preceding work by Gambino et_al [20] The same circuit modeling to calculate the ion probe current has been used for this study.
B. Post-processing methodology
In this work, a statistical analysis of the collected ion current signals, or time-of-flight signals (TOF) was performed. For every plasma event, the six electrostatic probes were positioned at an identical radial distance d from the plasma irradiation point at different lateral angles γ, collecting six TOF signals simultaneously with the EUV and photodiode signal. As a sample signal, the collected current signal is plotted in Fig. 2.
The TOF signals were filtered within the same EUV range with a window size of 10% to 15% of the maximum integrated EUV signal intensity. This filtering process was introduced to ensure consistent plasma properties for all evaluated probe signals at all radial distances. The EUV and TOF signals are in fact still subject to fluctuations within the spatial resolution achieved with the droplet positioning system. The EUV and ion emissions are both expected to be sensitive to the alignment of the droplet versus the laser focus volume. For the given EUV band of 10% to 15%, the sample standard deviation for the TOF peak current is on the order of σ_{I} ≈ ±12% while the sample standard deviation of the temporal peak position is on the order of σ_{t} ≈ ±5%. The EUV window for the filtering was chosen as such that a minimum sample size for each radial distance is ensured to obtain reliable estimates of standard deviation and a general validity of the data [32]. The average sample size for every radial position was 48 TOF signals. Subsequent to this filtering process, every TOF signal is post-processed and the resulting numbers were averaged leading to averaged results with a corresponding sample standard deviation. A similar methodology is used in the work of Gambino et_al and Giovannini et_al [15,20]
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Ion expansion dynamics
The ion dynamics was studied with an array of six electrostatic probes in the lateral expansion direction. The propagation through the time-space domain was analyzed in detail for the centimeter-microseconds range for droplet-based tin plasmas. By breaking up a tin jet with an actuated piston into a droplet train, variations in size and position are inherent. Motion stages and triggering schemes are in place to control the positional stability of the droplets. The plasma dynamics change depending on the droplet size and position versus the laser focus volume. These variations lead to the requirement for a statistical analysis.
In Fig. 2, six TOF signals are shown for different angular positions at a distance d = 1.5 cm. Quantitative results of the collected ion current have to be evaluated with caution because the signals may be distorted due to secondary electron emission. One way to account for secondary electron emission on probes is the knowledge of the secondary electron emission coefficient. However, the availability of experimental secondary electron emission coefficients (or electron yield) is poor, in particular in the low energy region <1 keV. At present, no experimental data on electron yields for tin ions of various charge states (for this study, mainly Sn^{+1} and Sn^{+2}) with kinetic energies in the range of the present experimental measurements are available. The few existing values for the low energy region suggest that the secondary electron emission below 1 keV is significantly smaller than one electron per impacting ion [33,34]. For this reason, this effect is neglected for the presented data.
Before the main ion bulk reaches the ion-collecting probe, fast peaks are visible in the temporal range between 0 to 200 ns. The precise origin of these fast signal peaks is still not entirely resolved and is still the subject of discussion [35]. The very first positive peak is temporally almost indistinguishable from the laser photodiode signal suggesting an interaction of photons with the probe tip. Radiation in the EUV and UV range is emitted by the plasma which can cause a photoelectric effect, thus a positive peak becomes visible. The first positive peak is often followed by a negative peak which can be caused by fast electrons originating from the interaction of the laser pulse with the target material. Followed by the fast electrons, high velocity ions are sometimes visible indicated by a positive signal peak. A detailed study of the fast peaks with an adequate temporal resolution larger than the currently used 60 MS/s is the subject of ongoing research. Based on the methodology described in Sec. III B, the six TOF signals were post-processed at different radial distances d from the plasma ignition point. The ion expansion behavior based on the position-time plots d–t_{A} of the ions is shown in Fig. 3 to examine the velocity change as a function of distance and time. From the TOF, one can obtain the most probable arrival time t_{A} at the ion current profile maximum [36]. The error bars in Fig. 3 are the sample standard deviation of the averaged TOF signals. Apart from physical influence factors, such as target properties and irradiation characteristics, the measurement uncertainty is also defined by the experimental methodology and the post-processing method. One notices that the error bars shown in Fig. 3 in the laser backward direction (γ > 90°) are larger in size compared to the laser forward direction (γ < 90°) which can be caused by both effects. For clarity, only the two limiting cases γ = 50° and γ = 130° are shown since the remaining lateral angles range between these two limiting cases. The slope of the linear regression shown in Fig. 3 reveals the ion bulk expansion velocity v_{Bulk}=ddt{A}(d) as a single global variable which differs from the local or time-averaged ion velocity v = d/t_{A}. Therefore, the ion bulk expansion velocities along the radial distance d was found to be constant within the error margin across the measurement range as demonstrated in Fig. 3. d–t_{A} plots are also used to evaluate the influence of the background gas on the plume front. For higher static pressures of p_{s} ≥ 100 mTorr (≈1.3 × 10^{−1} mbar), the shock model of the form d = a t_{A}^{0.4} is applied and for even higher pressures, the drag model d = x_{f} (1-exp(βt_{A})) is used [37,38]. The linear correlation suggests a small influence of the argon background gas onto the ion bulk expansion velocity for an argon static pressure of 2 × 10^{−2} mbar in the considered measurement range. Similar observations were made by Amoruso et_al [39] for MgB_{2} slab targets for pressures p_{s} < 7 Pa in an argon atmosphere. Once the displaced background gas mass becomes comparable to the ablated mass deviations from the free plume, the expansion become visible [40,41]. In the present study, the plume mass becomes comparable at around 10 cm, which is larger than the measurement range of this study.
Based on the linear regression of the d–t_{A} plots, the bulk expansion velocities v_{Bulk} were evaluated for the entire lateral angular range as demonstrated in Fig. 3. The uncertainty analysis was based on the upper and lower bound method. The equivalent least squares method was used to create a linear fit to illustrate the velocity trend in the angular direction in Fig. 4. The measured bulk velocities are 2.9 cm/μs and 2.1 cm/μs for γ = 50° and γ = 130°, respectively, resulting in a velocity difference of close to 30%. The corresponding kinetic energies W_{Kin}=12m_{i}vBulk2 range between 270 and 517 eV, with m_{i} being the ion mass. In previous studies, an acceleration process in the centimeter range was measured for a lower pressure with a nitrogen background. However, in this work, within the considered measurement range, the velocity gradient was found to be constant within the error margin. The high velocities of up to 2.9 cm/μs insinuate an acceleration process takes place at smaller distances of d < 1.5 cm or the velocity difference is within the error bounds.
In terms of the light source application, the measured kinetic energies imply the following: assuming Ruthenium as a capping layer of the ML mirror, the sputter yield ranges from 0.63 to 1.49 atoms per impacting ion for γ = 50° and γ = 130°, respectively, evaluated from tabulated values in the work of Matsunami et_al [42] Murakami and Basko [43] calculated the asymptotic limit for kinetic energies with the quasi-neutral approximation to be ε_{0} = 2ZT_{e0} for the particular case of a spherical target and a polytropic index γ = 4/3. Considering an initial temperature T_{e0} = 30–40 eV in the EUV dominant region as stated by Burdt et_al [10] with a mean charge state of Z¯ = 12.8 calculated with the collisional-radiative model in the stationary state [29], results in asymptotic expansion velocities of v_{∞} = 3.5–4 cm/μs. Therefore, the measured bulk velocities of 2–3 cm/μs are in the same order of magnitude as predicted by the adiabatic expansion model assuming complete thermal energy conversion into kinetic expansion energy.
The integrated ion current collection is studied also with increasing distance for different lateral positions to understand how the ion expansion dynamics is influenced by the recombination processes. Figure 5 depicts the measurement data of the integrated positive ion current Q for the two limiting lateral cases γ = 50° and γ = 130° along with two inverse square fits of the form Q = α_{i}d^{−2} with α_{50°} = 425 C cm^{2} and α_{130°} = 162 C cm^{2}. From the analysis done in Fig. 5, it was inferred that the ion current is inversely proportional to the square with distance (Q ∼ d^{−2}) within the error margin. This proportionality is in agreement with the collected ion current of a constant collection area electrostatic probe with increasing distance in vacuum while neglecting the effective shape of the plasma [37]. The opposing process to recombination is the plasma expansion, thereby lowering the plasma density. The inverse squared proportionality with distance indicates that the driving mechanism within the error margin relates to the three-dimensional plasma expansion and not the recombination processes for the presented measurement range. The observation of plasma expansion as the main rarefaction mechanism is in agreement with the finding of constant velocity as assessed in Fig. 3. Tallents et_al [44] and Lorusso et_al [45] argue that an increase in measured expansion velocities with increasing radial distance for measurements with electrostatic probes are explained by the recombination of lower charge states, which was confirmed with the present measurements for a droplet target. The collected ion current in the laser forward and backward direction show both the same inverse squared proportionality with a larger amplitude α_{130°} at γ = 130°, indicating a forward peaked plasma expansion. The shape of the plasma is well known for slab targets and is governed by the following empirical relation: Q∼Acos^{p}γ. Here, p represents an empirical factor. In the present study, however this equation is not applicable since the plasma expansion is not limited to a single hemisphere. Initial results of the plasma shape right after the laser pulse were acquired with an intensified CCD camera imaging the visible light emission. These measurements revealed a characteristic kidney shape [46]. However, modeling the exact shape of the plasma in the centimeter range is dependent on many factors such as the target size, laser focus volume, and positional accuracy and exceeds the scope of this work.
Figure 6 shows the measured ion number density at the minimum and maximum lateral position of γ = 50° and 130° as a function of distance d. The ion density is calculated with Eq. (5) with v as the plasma flow velocity as described in Sec. I and evaluated for radial distances d ≤ 4 cm to be able to apply the assumption of thin sheaths. Besides the measured data, the numerical model described in Sec. II is used to validate the measured ion number density. As described in Sec. II B, the plasma density is modelled following the solution of the gas-dynamic equations in combination with the ellipsoidal ion front expansion with the ion speed of sound. The interpolated ion density is shown in Fig. 6 which demonstrates an agreement within the error bars for radial distances between 1.5 and 2.5 cm. For larger distances, either the model under-predicts or the ion number measurements over-predict the ion number density. A potential explanation for this behavior is the growth of the probe sheath with distance since the electron density decreases [see Eq. (3)], thereby artificially increasing the collection area. This increased collection area would lead to an increase in the collected ion current resulting in an over-prediction of the ion density. The dimensionality of the measurements for the ion number density could not be replicated by the model representation. The introduced model is based on mean ion charge states which might under-predict the directionality for the charge specific ion expansion being present in reality.
B. Electrostatic acceleration and recombination
The incoming laser photons excite the free electrons which in turn, through electron-neutral and electron-ion collisions, transfer their energy to the ions. The ion temperature will remain below the electron temperature but eventually reach similar magnitudes. The fast electrons are able to escape the plasma volume because of their high mobility thereby creating an electrostatic field between ions and electrons. A difference in expansion velocities for different ion charge states establishes, attributed to the space-charge effects between fast electrons and ions, whereby charge selective acceleration of ions takes place. Transfer of energy to the electrons can be explained by two mechanisms, namely three-body recombination [48] and the absorption of incident laser radiation due to inverse bremsstrahlung [49]. The electrons are able to transfer their thermal energy into ion kinetic energy in a short time compared to the pulse duration [50]. This process is repeated a couple of times and is described by the following scaling law: W_{Kin}=nZ¯T_{0}+T_{0}, where T_{0} is the initial electron temperature and n is the number of times the acceleration process is repeated or the number of times an electron loses and regains its thermal energy. In this subsection, the link between the charge-specific electrostatic acceleration and the recombination processes in the centimeter range is discussed.
The collected TOF signal, by a positively charged probe in the electron saturation region, represents the sum of all positively charged particles and is therefore the superposition of all charged states of a plasma according to the following relation [45,50]:
where Q is the collected charge and Z relates to the charge state. In the former experimental and theoretical studies and as described above, it is shown that the charge state of the ion species correlates with their kinetic energy and thus also with their expansion velocity [9,10,50]. Therefore, the TOF is a representation of the convoluted ions with different velocities in the time domain. The applied diagnostics allow local measurements in the centimeter range but do not allow a differentiation between the different charge states.
To study the change of the ion wave front, the averaged normalized ion profiles were investigated in detail in Fig. 7 for a probe signal at a lateral angle of γ = 50°. As revealed by Fig. 7, the ion wave front broadens with increasing distance. This broadening is inherently coupled to the different ions groups with different velocities convoluted under the ion current curve depicted in Fig. 7. Since the collected ion profiles were not collected in high vacuum, interaction of the ion species with the background gas through collisions resulting in thermalization is an additional cause for the broadening of the TOF signal as reported in the literature [12,51]. Thermalization is the process of fast particle interaction with the background gas toward a thermal equilibrium which is dependent on the initial energy of the ions, the background gas pressure, and the mass ratio (MR) between the background gas and ions. Thermalization processes are typically associated with the slowdown of the plume, which could not be confirmed by the velocity measurements. This suggests that thermalization with an argon background gas at a pressure of 2 × 10^{−2} mbar is not the main cause for the TOF signal broadening. Amoruso et_al [51] also experimentally investigated different background-gas pressure regimes and their impact on the plume expansion. The background gas pressure used in this study is expected to feature a negligible influence on the integrated collected charge, based on the low pressure regime study of Amoruso et_al which tested pressures up to 1 × 10^{−2} mbar. Kools [52] theoretically studied the expansion of different mass ratios and kinetic energies. He found that for platinum ion species with kinetic energies of 70 to 80 eV up to 200 mTorr, are necessary to thermalize the plume in an O_{2} background (MR ≈ 6) within 5 cm. In our case with tin as the target material and argon as the background (MR ≈ 3) with kinetic energies ranging between 270 and 517 eV with a background gas level of 2 × 10^{−2} mbar (≈15 mTorr), thermalization is not expected to be a main contribution to the TOF signal broadening.
As indicated earlier, with increasing ion charge state, the ion kinetic energy increases and all ion charge states are convoluted under the measured waveform, the TOF has the natural tendency to broaden with time and distance as demonstrated in Fig. 7. From this follows that an approximation with shifted Maxwellian distributions appear to have no physical meaning since the velocities of the accelerated ions are mainly driven by the electric field [49]. To account for the ambipolar acceleration, Torrisi et_al [53] inserted an additional term, the Coulomb velocity, resulting in the shifted Maxwell-Boltzmann-Coulomb (SMBC) distribution. The Coulomb velocity is dependent on the charge state which was not measured in this study. Thus, the TOF were not fitted with a SMBC distribution but the broadening process was evaluated based on the FWHM of the profile as shown in Fig. 8. The same qualitative trend as shown in Fig. 8 was found for the complete angular range from 50° to 130°, for clarity only one probe was plotted. The results show a broadening of the TOF signals for distances up to 4 cm from the plasma irradiation site. For distances d > 4 cm, the FWHM levelled off to a constant value indicating a constant ion waveform shape. A constant ion profile shape with increasing distance suggests a ceasing relative velocity between the ion species contained within the measured ion current waveform for distances d > 5 cm. The correlation of expansion velocity with the ion charge state hence suggests also a constant charge state for the ion bulk for distances larger than 5 cm. The topic of charge freeze is treated for slab targets theoretically [54] and experimentally for tin [55] and copper [45,56]. The study presented by Burdt et_al [55] on flat tin targets was performed with a laser intensity of 8.3 × 10^{11} W/cm^{2} which is a few times higher than the laser intensity used in this experiment, where a critical distance for charge freeze of less than 5.5 cm was evaluated which correlates well with the presented findings. Roudskoy [54] proposed a scaling law for the critical distance until charge freeze occurs
In this equation, T_{in} relates to the initial plasma temperature after the heating stage, v is the ion expansion velocity, τ_{l} is the pulse duration, n_{crit} is the critical electron density, and d_{Spot} is the laser focus diameter. The main message of this relation is ions with high expansion velocities recombine at greater distances from the target than slowly moving ions. With typical parameters for EUV emitting Nd:YAG irradiated LPPs, the critical distance L_{crit} would be on the order of centimetres [55]. One might expect that the recombination is enhanced in the backward direction due to a lower expansion velocity. This assumption, however, could not be confirmed for the ion bulk, which can be caused by the lower ion number density in the backward direction as shown in Sec. III B.
To study the high velocity ions and their expansion behavior, the leading edge of the TOF signals, defined by 12% of the ion profile maximum, was studied as a function of the radial distance d and lateral angle γ where all probes are shown with increasing γ from left to right, as demonstrated in Fig. 9. The leading edge primarily represents the higher charge states. Initially, for distances d < 3 cm, the gradient and therefore the expansion velocity are constant within the error margin for the entire lateral measurement range. For lateral angles γ < 82°, the leading edge has a constant gradient within the error margin, for the complete radial measurement range of 1.5 up to 7 cm. With increasing lateral angles γ > 82°, an inflection point becomes apparent at a radial distance of 4–5 cm indicating an ion front slowdown. This observation suggests an anisotropic recombination in the laser forward and backward direction. In the laser forward direction, the ions have a higher local velocity of up to 3.5 cm/μs. Thus, these ions propagate faster through the density-temperature space of increased recombination than the ions in the backward direction explaining the different expansion dynamics.
V. CONCLUSION
The temporal and spatial ion dynamics in the lateral direction with mass-limited droplet targets irradiated by a Nd:YAG laser was studied experimentally by means of an electrostatic probe array. It was found that the ion bulk expansion velocities along the radial distance from the plasma irradiation point are constant within the error margin across the measurement range of 1.5 to 7 cm. The ion bulk velocities scale from 2.9 cm/μs at a lateral angle of 50° to 2.1 cm/μs at a lateral angle of 130° versus the laser axis resulting in a velocity difference of close to 30%. In terms of the light source application, this correlates to a sputter yield for Ruthenium of 0.63 to 1.49 atoms per impacting ion for γ = 50° and γ = 130°. The forward peaked ion collection results from the measured ion current collection. Furthermore, the ion current is inversely proportional within the error margin to the square with distance (Q ∼ d^{−2}) which is in agreement with the collected current of a constant collection area electrostatic probe. This result shows that the driving ion rarefaction mechanism is due to the three-dimensional plasma expansion and not recombination for measurement distances in the centimeter range under the considered measurements conditions. The broadening of the ion current waveform with increasing radial distance was studied and it was observed that the ion profile shape did not change for distances larger than 5 cm for all lateral positions. Linking this to charge specific acceleration processes suggests ceasing recombination processes for the ion bulk. For the first time, an anisotropic recombination behavior around a droplet target was documented by studying the leading edge of the ion profile, representing the high velocity ions. This observation is explained by the velocity dependent recombination behavior.
