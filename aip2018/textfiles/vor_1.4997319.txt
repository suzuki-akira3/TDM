Structural and optical properties of semi-polar (11-22) InGaN/GaN green light-emitting diode structure
Semi-polar (11-22) InGaN multiple quantum well (MQW) green light-emitting diode (LED) structures have been realized by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition on an m-plane sapphire substrate. By introducing double GaN buffer layers, we improve the crystal quality of semi-polar (11-22) GaN significantly. The vertical alignment of the diffraction peaks in the (11-22) X-ray reciprocal space mapping indicates the fully strained MQW on the GaN layer. The photoluminescence spectra of the LED structure show stronger emission intensity along the [1-100] InGaN/GaN direction. The electroluminescence emission of the LED structure is very broad with peaks around 550 nm and 510 nm at the 100 mA current injection for samples A and B, respectively, and exhibits a significant blue-shift with increasing drive current.
III-nitride semiconductors have been widely used for light emitting devices (LEDs) in the green, blue, and ultraviolet (UV) spectral range [1]. However, the active regions of the GaN based LEDs grown on c-plane sapphire suffer from polarization induced electrical fields, leading to a reduction in device efficiencies, i.e., the quantum-confined stark effect (QCSE) [2,3]. To eliminate the polarization effect, LEDs on semi-/non-polar orientations of nitrides were used [4,5]. The semi-polar (11-22) surface is of special interest because high efficiency green and yellow LEDs have been previously reported [6–13] with best results for devices grown on bulk (11-22) GaN substrates [6]. Such substrates are very expensive and small in size and thus not suitable for mass-production. Thus, it is preferable to grow LEDs on a low-cost sapphire substrate. However, (11-22) GaN films grown on non-patterned (10-10) m-plane sapphire substrates normally contain a high density of extended defects such as basal-plane stacking faults, prismatic stacking faults, and partial dislocations [10]. In order to reduce such defects, several approaches have been proposed in recent years [11–13].
In this paper, we report on the growth and characterization of the semi-polar (11-22) InGaN LED structure grown on m-plane sapphire. Two samples with the active region grown at 740 °C and 770 °C are presented, respectively. The growth of the semi-polar (11-22) InGaN MQW (multiple quantum well) LED structure on m-plane sapphire was conducted in a horizontal metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) reactor (AIXTRON 200/4 RF-S). To avoid memory effects, the reactor was baked after each run. GaN buffers were used to improve the crystal quality and surface morphology of semi-polar (11-22) GaN layers, where the low temperature GaN buffer was grown at 525 °C and the high temperature GaN buffer layer was grown at 1020 °C and 60 mbar, keeping the V/III ratio of approximately 900. The LT-GaN buffer layer provided nucleation sites for GaN growth initiation on sapphire and relaxed the strain between GaN and sapphire substrates [14]. The HT-GaN buffer layer was employed to increase the growth island sizes on the growth condition of lower V/III ratio, leading to subsequent bulk films suitable for device fabrication. After that, a 2–3 μm thick undoped GaN layer was grown at 60 mbar and 1020 °C with a higher V/III ratio of 1500. The LED structure grown on this u-GaN consisted of a 1.5 μm-thick Si-doped n-type GaN, an active region consisting of ten periods of InGaN/GaN MQW with thicknesses of 3.5 nm/10 nm, a 25 nm-thick Mg-doped p-type AlGaN electron blocking layer, and a 150 nm-thick Mg-doped p-type GaN. InGaN wells and GaN barriers were grown at the same growth temperature. But the different temperatures of MQWs were used at T_{InGaN/GaN} = 740/740 °C for sample A and T_{InGaN/GaN}= 770/770 °C for sample B, respectively. After growth, the samples were in-situ annealed in the reactor under N_{2} for 20 min at 800 °C.
The crystal quality and structural properties of semi-polar GaN samples were examined by high resolution X-ray diffraction (HRXRD: Diffuse X-ray Scattering Station of Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility), and a Huber five-circle diffractometer was used. The radiation energy of the X-ray beam was 8.05 keV with a wavelength of 1.54573 Å. Reciprocal space mapping (RSM) has been further measured along both the [1-100] and the [-1-123] in-plane directions to analyze the strain in detail. The surface morphology of the semi-polar (11-22) MQW was analyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The optical qualities were characterized by room temperature micro-PL (photoluminescence) with a 325 nm line of the HeCd laser, and the excitation power is 1.0 kW/cm^{2}. To observe the in-plane optical anisotropy effect, a Glan-Taylor polarizer was set before the slit of the monochromator of a micro-PL system (Zolix Flex One) with the spectral resolution, spatial resolution, and numerical aperture (NA) of 0.1 nm, 5 μm, and 1.25, respectively. RT-EL (electroluminescence) measurements were performed directly on the LED wafers under direct current conditions using the wafer-edge contact metrology, i.e., the n-electrode was made on the edge of the LED wafers by soldering indium, and the p-electrode was touched on the surface of the wafers by the tip of electric experiment clips. EL spectra were collected from the top surface of the LED wafers by using the optical spectrometer of a micro-PL system (LabRAM HR800) without laser incidence. All these measurements are conducted on the same region of LED wafers.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) ω-2θ scans of the (1l-22) reflection on LED structure samples A and B in the cases of the X-ray incident beam parallel and perpendicular to the [1-100] GaN direction are presented in Fig. 1. The main peak is ascribed to (11-22) from the thick GaN layer, and the broader shoulder at a lower angle originates from the InGaN/GaN superlattice. Satellite peaks occur on either side of the InGaN zero-order peak. The numbers of identified satellite peaks in each spectrum were −4 to +2. The 0th peak of sample B was closer to the GaN peak, which means that the average indium incorporation of sample B was lower than that of sample A. The well thicknesses and composition for LED structure samples A and B were found to be about 3.8 nm thick with an In/III ratio of 32% and 3.4 nm thick with an In/III ratio of 25%, assuming pseudomorphic InGaN QWs in-plane strained to the GaN barriers. Furthermore, the width of the InGaN zero-order (11-22) peak of sample B was about 0.08°. Vickers et_al [15] previously reported that the width of the InGaN zero-order (002) peaks was about 0.07°, demonstrating that the semi-polar LED structures are of high quality and comparable to those grown on c-plane GaN [15]. The absence of the sapphire (30-30) diffraction peak perpendicular to the [1-100] direction was due to the tilt between [0001]_{sapphire} and [-1-123]_{GaN} [11].
XRD rocking curves (XRCs) have been measured with respect to the azimuth angle from 0° to 360°. Figures 2(a) and 2(b) show the XRD ω scanning of the (11-22) GaN reflection of LED structure samples A and B at azimuth angles of 0°, 30°, 60°, and 90°. The full width at half maximums (FWHMs) of the XRCs measured on the two samples along the [1-100] direction are broader than those along the [-1-123] direction. Such an typical anisotropic property has been widely reported in semi- or non-polar structures [16,17]. It has been suggested that either larger mosaic tilt of epilayers or higher density of defects such as threading dislocations and basal stacking faults (BSFs) could cause anisotropic broadening along the [1-100] direction [18]. Compared to the (11-22) GaN sample with a similar thickness obtained using our HT AlN buffer on m-plane sapphire (GaN exhibits the FWHMs of 0.42° along [1-100] and 0.22° along [-1-123]) [19], the crystal quality of our GaN using LT- and HT-GaN buffers has been significantly improved, as confirmed by FWHMs of 0.22° along the [1-100] direction and 0.12° along the [-1-123] direction. It should be noted that the GaN crystal qualities of samples A and B are almost the same good, providing a good template to the subsequent growth of the LED structure. In addition, a typical striated (or facet-like) surface morphology was observed on the surface of two semi-polar (11-22) MQW samples by AFM (see supplementary material) The root mean square (RMS) roughness values are 10.9 and 4.8 nm over the 5 × 5 μm^{2} surface area for samples with the MQW grown at different temperatures (T_{InGaN/GaN} = 740/740 °C and 770/770 °C, respectively). The anisotropic striated surface structure may be attributed to different growth rates (the incorporation probability and the diffusion length of surface atoms) of the various facets present in the semi-polar growth direction. The surface morphology of sample B is smoother than that of sample A when the indium composition in MQWs decreases.
To investigate the strain of the semi-polar LED structure, RSM in which the distortion or relaxation of the reciprocal lattice point (RLP) can be clearly observed was performed on the LED sample, as shown in Fig. 3. The vertical alignment of the diffraction peaks indicates the fully strained MQW on the n-GaN layer. When the (11-22) RSM is measured along [1-100], the RLPs of the GaN and the MQW layers nearly stand in a straight line with the RLP of sapphire, showing that the MQW layers are coherently grown on the GaN layers along this direction. However, along [-1-123], the epitaxial tilt between the crystal orientation of epitaxial layers and the underlying layers can be clearly observed. The underlying GaN layer with respect to the m-plane sapphire exhibits a tilt angle of 1.1°, while a tilt of 0.5° is observed for the MQW layers with respect to the underlying GaN. Such tilts indicate in the direction the existence of in-plane lattice mismatches between substrate, GaN, and InGaN MQWs. This is in good agreement with the analysis that ε_{1-100} is much larger than ε_{-1-123} in both the GaN and the MQW layers [20]. Tyagi et_al have reported that lattice tilt could cause partial strain relaxation via misfit dislocation generation at the InGaN/GaN interface and even be used to quantify the strain relaxation [21].
The polarization-dependent micro-PL experiment was carried out by rotating the Glan-Taylor polarizer with respect to the [-1-123]-axis from θ = 0° to 90°. The θ = 0° (90°) corresponds to E ǁ [-1-123] (E ⊥ [-1-123]) (inset of Fig. 4), where E is the electric field vector and θ is the polarization angle. Fig. 4 shows the polarized PL spectra of (11-22) LED sample B at room temperature. The slight difference of the background intensity around 420 nm might stem from external light sources (e.g., scattered illumination of the room) or belong to a polarization dependence of the grating efficiency or stray light inside the spectrograph. Of course, other unknown reasons cannot be ruled out. The Gaussian-function fittings were conducted to measured PL spectra for the definition of the peak positions. The results showed a red-shift of PL peaks with an increase in polarization angle θ. The integrated intensity is maximal for E ǁ [1-100] and is minimal for E ǁ [-1-123], which is similar to the observation reported for (11-22) GaN samples [18]. It is clear that LED sample B emits strongly polarized light and the polarization ratio “ρ” (defined as ρ=I_{[1−100]}−I_{[−1−123]}I_{[1−100]}+I_{[−1−123]}) is estimated to be 0.43. The red-shift of emission wavelength and the strong polarization property of emission intensity can be understood by considering the electronic band structure in WZ GaN. There are three closely spaced top valence bands (VBs) at the Brillouin-zone center (BZC): heavy hole (HH), light hole (LH), and crystal field split-off hole (CH). For E ǁ [-1-123], the transition dominantly involves the CH band, whereas the transition involves dominantly the HH and LH bands for E ⊥ [-1-123] [22]. Therefore, the PL peak energy for E ǁ [-1-123] (θ = 0°) is higher than that for E ⊥ [-1-123] (θ = 90°) as shown in Fig. 4. In addition, the PL intensity for E ⊥ [1-100] (θ = 0°) is lower because of the smaller thermal distribution of carriers for the CH band [23]. Another reason is that along the [1-100] direction, the sidewalls of facets may enhance light scattering, which would increase contribution to the PL intensity.
The EL properties due to injection currents ranging from 5 to 100 mA were examined. Figure 5 shows typical EL spectra of the LED structures A and B, and peak positions were obtained by fitting the EL spectra to Gaussian functions. Sample A had a blue-shift in emission from 563 nm at 5 mA to 546 nm at 100 mA, representing a net shift of 17 nm. In contrast, with increasing drive current, the EL main emission of sample B ranged from 525 nm to 511 nm with a wavelength shift of about 14 nm. The emission peak wavelength of samples A and B shifts from 546 nm to 511 nm at 100 mA when the Indium composition in MQWs decreases from 32% to 25%. It should be noted than the blue-shift became weaker when the injection currents exceed 20 mA. A blue-shift was still observed even though the polarization induced electric field should theoretically be reduced in semi-polar (11-22) LEDs. QCSE is unavoidable particularly before the built-in potential due to the pn junction is compensated by the applied forward bias [4]. The applied voltage exceeds the built-in potential (∼3 V) with a current of ∼20 mA [4]. Thus, the significant blue-shift of the EL peak below 20 mA can be explained by the combined effects of coulomb screening of polarization-induced QCSE [24] and the band filling of the localized states under high carrier injection condition [25], while the state-filling effect is responsible for the weak blue-shift above 20 mA. However, we noted that the different growth kinetics of the striated facets and edges would result in inhomogeneous composition of faceted InGaN layers, which might give rise to the observed blue shift to some extent.
In summary, we have demonstrated the MOCVD growth of the (11-22) green LED structure on m-sapphire, using GaN buffer-layers. The FWHM of XRCs decreased significantly, which indicates that the two GaN buffer layers could reduce BSFs and PDs and/or perfect dislocations. The strain has been investigated by (11-22) RSM measurements, and the vertical alignment of the diffraction peaks indicates the fully strained MQW on the GaN layer. (11-22) LED sample B emits strongly polarized light, and the polarization ratio ρ is estimated to be 0.43. The EL emission of the (11-22) LED samples is very broad with peaks around 550 nm and 510 nm at the 100 mA current injection for samples A and B, respectively, and exhibits a significant blue-shift with increasing drive current.
