The shape and dynamics of the generation of the splash forms in single-phase systems after drop hitting
The splash phenomenon is being increasingly explored with the use of modern measurement tools, including the high-speed cameras. Recording images at a rate of several thousand frames per second facilitates parameterization and description of the dynamics of splash phases. This paper describes the impact of a single drop of a liquid falling on the surface of the same liquid. Three single-phase liquid systems, i.e., water, petrol, and diesel fuel, were examined. The falling drops were characterized by different kinetic energy values depending on the height of the fall, which ranged from 0.1 to 7.0 m. Four forms, i.e., waves, crowns, semi-closed domes, and domes, were distinguished depending on the drop energy. The analysis of the recorded images facilitated determination of the static and dynamic parameters of each form, e.g., the maximum height of each splash form, the width of the splash form at its maximum height, and the rate of growth of the splash form. We, Re, Fr, and K numbers were determined for all analyzed liquid systems. On the basis of the obtained values of dimensionless numbers, the areas of occurrence of characteristic splash forms were separated.
I. INTRODUCTION
The splash phenomenon is generated by the impact of a drop falling on, e.g., the surface of a liquid or solid. In terms of environmental protection, this negative phenomenon can be a transport mechanism of various pollutants ( [Yang et_al, 1990]). This is particularly important in the case of the spread of petroleum contaminants (e.g., petrol or diesel fuel), which can be transferred by splash and contaminate water and/or soil near a leakage site ( [Castillo-Orozco et_al, 2016] and  [Murphy et_al, 2015]). Hence, accurate quantification of the splash phenomenon is essential.
The course of the direct contact between a single drop and a surface has been addressed in many investigations of various aspects of this phenomenon ( [Fernández-Raga et_al, 2017]). One of the areas analyzed by researchers was the phenomenon of a liquid drop splash on a solid surface. Some experiments involved an impact of a drop on a dry surface ( [Josserand and Thoroddsen, 2016];  [Liu et_al, 2015];  [Mandre et_al, 2009];  [Rioboo et_al, 2001];  [Vander Wal et_al, 2006a]; and  [Xu et_al, 2005]) or a wetted surface, i.e., covered with a thin film of the same liquid as the falling droplet ( [Cossali et_al, 2004];  [1997];  [Lee et_al, 2011];  [Pan and Hung, 2010];  [Rioboo et_al, 2003];  [Vander Wal et_al, 2006b];  [Wang and Chen, 2000]; and  [Yarin and Weiss, 1995]). In the case of a splash generated on a dry surface, the investigations were very frequently focused on the effect of the surface roughness ( [Darboux et_al, 2001];  [Lan et_al, 2016];  [Range and Feuillebois, 1998];  [Sikalo and Ganic, 2006];  [Sikalo et_al, 2002];  [Vander Wal et_al, 2006a]; and  [Xu et_al, 2005]) or the angle at which the drop hits the surface ( [Liu et_al, 2010];  [Mundo et_al, 1995];  [Sikalo and Ganic, 2006]; and  [Sikalo et_al, 2002]).  [Rioboo et_al (2001)] revealed six possible scenarios after the drop impact on a dry solid surface, such as deposition, prompt splash, corona splash, receding break-up, partial rebound, and complete rebound. In analyses of the splash generated on a wet surface, the authors focused on the aspects of the thickness of the liquid film ( [Coghe et_al, 1999];  [Cossali et_al, 2004];  [Lee et_al, 2011];  [Liang et_al, 2014];  [Vander Wal et_al, 2006b]; and  [Wang and Chen, 2000]), the type of the liquid ( [Krechetnikov and Homsy, 2009];  [Pan and Hung, 2010];  [Riboux and Gordillo, 2014];  [Rioboo et_al, 2003]; and  [Vander Wal et_al, 2006b]), and the degree of surface wettability ( [Marengo et_al, 2011];  [Range and Feuillebois, 1998];  [Sikalo and Ganic, 2006]; and  [Wang et_al, 2015]).
There are relatively many publications on the splash phenomenon in liquid systems (liquid–liquid impact). Obviously, its course will depend on the type of the liquids used. The majority of the published papers have addressed this phenomenon in homogeneous systems, in which the liquid drop fell on a layer of the same liquid, usually water ( [Cossali et_al, 2004];  [Liang et_al, 2014];  [Vander Wal et_al, 2006a]; and  [2006b]). Nevertheless, there are also papers presenting the splash phenomenon in other types of liquids, e.g., hydrocarbons ( [Liu et_al, 2010];  [Range and Feuillebois, 1998];  [Rioboo et_al, 2003]; and  [Xu et_al, 2005]). In recent years, experimental or modeling research has also been focused on immiscible liquid systems, such as petroleum products ( [Aryafar and Kavehpour, 2006];  [Castillo-Orozco et_al, 2016];  [Gopala and van Wachem, 2008];  [Murphy et_al, 2015];  [Peters et_al, 2016];  [Soloviev et_al, 2016]; and  [Yakhshi-Tafti et_al, 2010]).
To sum up the review of this group of studies, it can be noted that, regardless of the type of the liquid forming the drop and the surface hit by the drop, the determinants of the phenomenon’s course were similar. These included the size, velocity, and shape of the falling drop ( [Cole, 2007];  [Mundo et_al, 1995];  [Pan and Hung, 2010];  [Thoraval et_al, 2016]; and  [Yarin, 2006]), properties of the liquid, e.g., density, viscosity, or surface tension ( [Castrejón-Pita et_al, 2016];  [Krechetnikov and Homsy, 2009];  [Lan et_al, 2016];  [Mundo et_al, 1995];  [Pan and Hung, 2010];  [Riboux and Gordillo, 2014];  [Sikalo and Ganic, 2006];  [Sikalo et_al, 2002];  [Vander Wal et_al, 2006a];  [2006b]; and  [Yarin, 2006]), or ambient conditions, including temperature ( [Manzello and Yang, 2003]) and pressure ( [Liu et_al, 2010] and  [Xu et_al 2005]).
The technological progress observed over recent years has provided new tools for measurement and description of the splash phenomenon. Besides the new research methods, for example, for measurements of sound wave energy after the drop impact ( [Ryżak et_al, 2016] and  [Tajiri et_al, 2008]), dynamics of the drop impact ( [Korbiel et_al, 2015]), particle detachment after the drop impact ( [Ryżak and Bieganowski, 2012]), kinetic energy of rain ( [Fernández-Raga et_al, 2009] and  [Scholten et_al, 2011]), and the increasingly updated numerical models of the impact of a single liquid drop on the medium ( [Cheng and Lou, 2015];  [Lee et_al, 2011];  [Liang et_al, 2014];  [Liu et_al, 2010];  [Rieber and Frohn, 1999];  [Soloviev et_al, 2016];  [Thoraval et_al, 2016];  [Wang et_al, 2015]; and  [Yokoi, 2013]), the technique of image recording with high-speed cameras is used most frequently ( [Ahn et_al, 2013];  [Castrejón-Pita et_al, 2016];  [Furbish et_al, 2007];  [Long et_al, 2014]; and  [Ryżak et_al, 2015]).
The majority of studies of the splash phenomenon are focused on the so-called crown formation ( [Coghe et_al, 1999];  [Cossali et_al, 2004];  [1997];  [Krechetnikov and Homsy, 2009];  [Lee et_al, 2011]; and  [Rioboo et_al, 2003]). One of the main aspects of the investigations was parameterization of the phenomenon and description of the size of the generated splash form. In the study reported by  [Cossali et_al (1997)], the crown generation was divided into four phases: (i) crown formation and jetting, (ii) rim instability and jet formation, (iii) break-up of the jets and formation of secondary droplets, and (iv) crown collapsing period.  [Krechetnikov and Homsy (2009)] have discovered that there are three major types of crowns: axisymmetric, regular, and irregular.
The crown is not the only form generated by the drop impact on the surface. However, there are not many studies describing the generation of other forms, and the majority of the available investigations have been conducted in the aqueous system ( [Beczek et_al, 2017];  [Ghadiri, 2004]; and  [Kubota and Mochizuki, 2011]). Few publications report investigations carried out in other liquids ( [Sikalo and Ganic, 2006] and  [Pan and Hung, 2010]), including petroleum products ( [Murphy et_al, 2015]).
In the above-mentioned publications, the authors distinguish many splash forms, e.g., crown without break-up, mushroom, canopy, dome, jet, or column drop. However, the definitions thereof are not fully systematized, and some of these forms are not characterized but merely photographed.
Therefore, the aim of the present study was to describe differences in the shapes and dynamics of generation of various splash forms resulting from the impact of single liquid drops with varied kinetic energy values in single-phase liquid systems. The use of the liquids, which differed in interfacial and viscous properties in combination with different inertial forces, allowed us to hypothesize that it would be possible to more profoundly describe different forms of the splash phenomenon. The investigations were undertaken to address two issues: (i) the splash of petroleum products is one of the transfer mechanisms of these pollutants and (ii) exploration of splash in liquids characterized by different properties helps us to find out which of these properties determine the course of this phenomenon and to describe this phenomenon based on criterial numbers.
II. MATERIAL AND METHODS
Three single-phase liquid systems were used, i.e., distilled water, petrol, and diesel fuel (both petroleum products are from Orlen, Poland), in which the splash phenomenon occurred under the impact of a single drop on the surface of the same liquid. The study material was selected in such a way that each liquid was distinguished from the others by its one specific property: (i) water stood out in terms of the highest value of surface tension; (ii) petrol had the smallest, while diesel fuel had the highest values of kinematic viscosity; and (iii) all liquids differed in density—water had the highest density and petrol the lowest density. Basic characteristics of the liquids are shown in Table I.
The drops of the liquids were formed with the use of glass capillaries and a TH15 peristaltic pump (Aqua-Trend, Poland) injecting the liquids. The size of the capillaries was chosen for each liquid individually to obtain a similar drop size. The drop diameters were 3.3 mm (standard deviation, SD = 0.02 mm) for water, 3.3 mm (SD = 0.04 mm) for petrol, and 3.3 mm (SD = 0.04 mm) for diesel fuel.
Drops hitting the liquid surface had different kinetic energy values obtained with the use of 11 different heights of the drop fall, i.e., 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0, and 7.0 m (above the surface of the liquid). However, the kinetic energy values were calculated in three replications on the basis of the drop velocity measured by a speed camera and the mass of the drops (from the product of density and volume of the drop).
The liquid hit by the drops was placed in a 195 × 195 × 100 mm glass vessel. The dimensions of the vessel and the height of the liquid column were several-fold greater than the diameter of the falling drop, which prevented disturbance of the recorded splash by waves propagating from the vessel walls or bottom.
The experiments in all the variants were conducted in three replications at controlled and constant temperature of 20 °C ± 1 °C, pressure (1000 hPa ± 2 hPa), and humidity (50% ± 2%).
The splash phenomenon was recorded with the high-speed camera (MIRO M310, Vision Research, USA) capturing images at a rate of 3260 frames s^{−1}. The first frame to be analyzed showed the moment of the falling drop touching the surface of the liquid. The systems were illuminated by two 0.6 × 0.6 m light-emitting diode (LED) panels, each with a luminous flux of approximately 3500 lumens.
The acquired records have not been processed using any image techniques. The analysis of the geometrical parameters of splashed forms listed below was based on calculations of pixels for every image. The binary schemes presented in Fig. 1 are examples of measured parameters for different forms.
The following parameters were used to describe the differences between the generated splash forms in the analyzed systems:
• The maximum height of the splash form (h_{max}) (Fig. 1).
• The width of the splash form at its maximum height (w_{h_max}) (Fig. 1). The w_{h_max} parameter should not be confused with the maximum width of the form generated at the splash time, as this parameter would be difficult to determine. After the drop hits the surface, the generating form widens and finally spreads.
• The rate of the growth of the splash form to the maximum height (r_{h_max}). This is a ratio of h_{max} to the time interval between the droplet fall on the liquid surface and the moment of the greatest height of the splash form, i.e., between the first frame and the frame that preceded the one that showed the beginning of the spread of the splash form.
There are many criterial numbers that can be used to characterise the drop impact on the surface ( [Yarin, 2006]). They can be divided into two groups: let us call them primary and secondary numbers.
Primary numbers describe the impact of different types of forces, for example, on the splash phenomenon. In this group of numbers, the following can be indicated ( [Yarin, 2006]):
• Weber number (We)—the ratio of inertial to surface tension forces,
• Reynolds number (Re)—the ratio of inertial to viscous forces,
• Froude number (Fr)—the ratio of inertial to gravitational forces,
whereρ—liquid density (kg m^{−3}),μ—liquid dynamic viscosity (kg m^{−1} s^{−1}),σ—surface tension for a fluid–air interface (N m^{−1}),g—acceleration of gravity (m s^{−2}),d—diameter of the drop (m),v—velocity of the drop (m s^{−1}).
The secondary numbers are derived on the basis of primary numbers. The idea of introducing secondary numbers was prompted by the need to take into account more of the effects that occur during the researched phenomenon. For instance, K number characterises the relation between inertial and both interfacial and viscous forces ( [Yarin, 2006]),
whereOh—Ohnesorge number—is the ratio of the viscous force to the square root of the product of surface and inertial forces,
The experiment was planned so that drops of individual liquids were released from the same 11 heights (h_{1}). Because the analyzed liquids were characterized by different densities, the falling drops, even from the same heights, differed in kinetic energy at the moment of impact with the surface. Seeking to become independent of this differentiating factor, the obtained values of dimensionless numbers were presented in a dependence on the dimensionless relative height (h_{1}/h_{2}). The hypothetical height (h_{2}) was determined by comparing the experimentally determined kinetic energy of the drop with the hypothetical potential energy that a drop would have at the start of free fall, assuming no air drag.
The h_{1}/h_{2} ratio (named the dimensionless height) uniquely determines what part of the drop’s energy is lost to the environment in the real system, as a result of existing air drag. This was determined based on the actual drop speed and the conservation energy law,
wherem—mass of falling drop,g—acceleration of the earth,h_{1}—height of falling drop,h_{2}—hypothetical height of the drop that falls without air drag,v—speed of falling drop.
After inserting the Froude number [Eq. (3)] into Eq. (6), the final pattern was obtained on the dimensionless height,
whered—diameter of falling drop,Fr—Froude number [Eq. (3)].
III. RESULTS
A. Types of forms generated on the liquid surface by the drop impact
Different forms generated on the liquid surface by the drop impact were distinguished in relation to the energy of the falling drop and properties of the liquid (Fig. 2): wave, crown, semi-closed dome, and dome.
This division was based on the shape of the generated form. The wave was characterized by the absence of spikes; therefore, its maximum height was the same at each of its points [Fig. 2(a)]. When the energy of the falling drop had a sufficiently high value, spikes forming on the wave with droplets detaching therefrom were observed. This splash form was called a crown [Fig. 2(b)]. The further increase in the kinetic energy was accompanied by formation of semi-closed domes [Fig. 2(c)] and closed domes (hereafter referred to as “domes”) [Fig. 2(d)]. The difference between them was that, in the latter form, a thin film of the liquid was raised by the energy of the falling drop to enclose an air bubble.
The term “canopy” is used in the division of forms generated by a drop impact proposed by  [Cole (2007)]. In our study, we chose to follow  [Kubota and Mochizuki (2011)] in using the term “dome,” since “canopy” in the field of splash is sometimes used in another context ( [Saint-Jean et_al, 2004]).
These splash forms should be regarded as primary, i.e., those generated in the first phase of the phenomenon. Over long-term observation, the generated wave, crown, or dome drop causes a secondary splash and generation of other forms, e.g., a jet and column drop ( [Cole, 2007] and  [Pan and Hung, 2010]).
It is worth noting that the splash phenomenon can persist up to several hundred milliseconds, depending on the dynamics of the system.
B. Variability of splash forms
Figure 3 presents four various forms generated by the impact of the drop of each liquid falling from different heights onto the surface of the same liquid in three single-phase systems: water, petrol, and diesel fuel.
As shown in Fig. 3, similar splash forms were generated in the three single-phase systems: (i) small waves, (ii) crowns, (iii) semi-closed domes, and (iv) domes. However, the forms varied depending on the heights from which the drops of the liquid fell.
A comparison of the images shown in Fig. 3 reveals a general principle, whereby the forms generated in
• petrol changed at the lowest heights from which the drop falls (for example, crowns were observed from 0.2 m, semi-closed domes were observed from 0.5 m, and domes were observed from 1.5 m),
• water changed at the greatest heights (i.e., crowns were observed from 0.3 m, semi-closed domes were observed from 2.0 m, and domes were observed from 5.0 m.
The analysis of the differences between each system demonstrates different shapes of the crowns in the case of diesel fuel than those noted when the other two liquids were used. In the diesel fuel, the crown spikes were pointed outwards and curved were pointed downwards in the initial phase [Figs. 4(a) and 4(b)]. They began to move upwards only after circa 3 ms [Fig. 4(c)]. In the other two systems (water and petrol), the crown spikes were raised upwards from the beginning of the growth of the form.
C. Kinetic energy of falling drops
The height from which the splash-generating drop falls directly determines its kinetic energy. In all the analyzed systems, the drops fell freely from the same 11 heights. However, the kinetic energy values for the drops of the different liquids falling from the same height differed due to the different densities of the analyzed liquids. An indirect influence on the kinetic energy of the falling drop was exerted by the surface tension of the liquids, which determined the shape of the drop. This, in turn, had an effect on, e.g., air drag. The correlation between the kinetic energy and the height of the drop fall is shown in Fig. 5.
As shown in Fig. 5, the kinetic energy values for the petrol and diesel fuel drops achieved a plateau. This indicates that they fell in uniform motion from a height of circa 5 m. This was not observed for the water drop; instead, any increase in the fall height was accompanied by an increase in the velocity and, consequently, in kinetic energy.
D. Variability of the parameters of the splash forms in relation to the height of the falling drops
Figure 6 presents mean height values h_{max} [Fig. 6(a)] and mean width values w_{h_max} [Fig. 6(b)] for the four “primary” splash forms depending on the height of the drop fall.
In all the analyzed systems, the same correlation can be noted irrespective of the form generated by the drop impact, i.e., an initial rise in the drop fall height causes a rapid increase in the height of the splash form. The increase in the form height is substantially reduced from the height of approximately 1.5 m, and a plateau can be observed in the graph of the petrol and water systems shown in Fig. 6(a). A similar finding was noted upon analysis of the w_{h_max} parameter, which stabilized in all the systems starting with the height of the drop fall of 2.0 m and higher.
An important finding provided by the analysis of Figs. 6(a) and 6(b) is that the results obtained in the diesel fuel system diverge from those obtained in water and petrol. In the case of h_{max}, the noticeable differentiation starts at the drop fall height of 0.5 m and proceeds along the consecutive height values.
For better illustration of the difference, Fig. 7 shows examples of a semi-closed dome in the three analyzed systems. The criterion for selection of the images was the moment preceding the closure of the dome; therefore, different time points are indicated in Figs. 7(a)–7(c). It is clear that the semi-closed dome in the diesel fuel system is substantially higher immediately before the closure than that noted in the other systems. Similar differences were exhibited by the diesel fuel system for the w_{h_max} parameter.
Another parameter analyzed was the rate of the growth of the splash forms until achievement of their maximum height in relation to the height of the falling drops (Fig. 8).
The analysis of the graph in Fig. 8 reveals differences in the course of the changes in h_{max} [Fig. 6(a)] and w_{h_max} [Fig. 6(b)]. The difference is particularly evident in the case of the diesel fuel system. As shown in Fig. 6, the values of the parameters of the form size are substantially higher in the diesel system than for the other liquids. In turn, the rate of generation of the splash forms was considerably more comparable in all the liquid systems (Fig. 8).
The analysis of the data presented in Fig. 8 indicates that forms generated in petrol, which is characterized by the lowest density and viscosity, had the highest growth rate; in turn, the lowest r_{h_max} values were noted for the diesel fuel system, which exhibited a substantially higher value of viscosity than the other liquids.
E. Characterization of the system by numbers used in fluid dynamics
Since the height of the liquid film in the experiments was sufficiently large, the course of the splash phenomenon was mainly determined by the properties of the liquid, i.e., surface tension, viscosity, and density. Dimensionless numbers We, Re, Fr, and K [Eqs. (1)–(4)] are useful parameters of these properties used in the description of splash. Figure 9 shows the values of these numbers depending on the dimensionless height. The use of a dimensionless parameter allows for the analysis of the changes in the values of criterial numbers and their dependencies for liquid systems with a high degree of differentiation. It should be noted that this approach also makes it easier to compare the presented results with the results obtained by other researchers.
To sum up the data contained in Fig. 9, it should be noted that the Re number differentiated the variables in the system to the highest extent of all the four numbers [Fig. 9(b)]. In this case, the results obtained for both petroleum products were separated by the results calculated for water. This course of the curves is associated with the differences in the viscosity of the analyzed liquids (Table I), which is one of the components of the Re number.
The We and Fr numbers [Figs. 9(a) and 9(c)] allow distinction between the phenomenon in the petroleum product systems and that proceeding in the aqueous system. The similarities of the We number changes in petrol and diesel fuel [Fig. 9(a)] can be explained by the values of surface tension (Table I). As the surface tension of water differed from that of petroleum products, it can be stated that the ratio of inertial to surface tension forces was greater for the petrol and diesel fuel [Eq. (1)]. Given that the Fr number describes the ratio of inertial forces to gravitational ones [Eq. (3)], while the kinetic energy of petroleum and diesel drops was very similar, although the energy of water drops was different (Fig. 5), this explains why the similarity of the Fr number changes [Fig. 9(c)].
The analysis of the K number value [Fig. 9(d)] indicates that the most divergent values were obtained for the petrol system. The values calculated for water and diesel were highly similar at the lower heights (<2 m); next, they diverged as in the case of the Re number. Since the K number is calculated from the We and Oh numbers [Eq. (5)], in this case the results also depended on several properties of the liquid. A more detailed analysis of the calculated values of the K number allowed identification of limit values at which spikes were formed on the wave, i.e., the crown was generated [for K = 2600—line “A” in Fig. 9(d)] and the dome was closed [for K = 22 200—line “B” in Fig. 9(d)] regardless of the type of the system.
Figure 10 shows the dependence of the We number on the Re number on logarithmic scale, determined for three liquid systems.
Such a combination of data provided the opportunity to separate areas in all the analyzed liquid systems where waves (hollow symbols), crowns or semi-closed domes (gray symbols), and domes (black symbols) were created as a result of the drop impact effect (Fig. 10). In addition, based on the dependence proposed by  [Deegan et_al (2008)], c=We⋅Re, two straight lines were interpolated that separated the above-mentioned areas of the formed forms:
• line c1 separated the areas of occurrence of waves and crowns; c1 = 1.86 × 10^{4} determined the limit value at which the spikes began to appear on the wave;
• line c2 separated the areas of occurrence of semi-closed domes and closed domes; c2 = 27.1 × 10^{4} determined the limit value at which the dome was closed.
IV. DISCUSSION
The analysis of the results of the forms generated on the liquid surface upon the impact of a falling drop and the magnitude of these forms suggest a question about the causes of this variability. As shown by the present investigations, the shape of the form will definitely depend on the combination of three groups of determinants: (i) kinetic energy at the impact of the drop of the liquid onto the surface of the liquid system, (ii) properties of the liquid from which the drop is formed, and (iii) properties of the liquid onto which the drop falls ( [Castillo-Orozco et_al, 2016];  [Coghe et_al, 1999];  [Mundo et_al, 1995]; and  [Yarin, 2006]). Since the analyzed experiment involves an impact of a drop formed of a given liquid falling into a vessel containing the same liquid and the ambient conditions and geometry of the systems are the same in each variant, the specification presented above can be simplified to two factors: the energy of the drop and the properties of the liquid.
A. Influence of the drop kinetic energy on the forms arising after the impact
The kinetic energies of the drops of the petroleum products were similar. The differences between them were associated with the differences in the density of the liquids. As already mentioned, the drops fell in uniform motion above the height of 5.0 m in both these cases. No uniform motion was observed in the case of the water drop. The maximum velocity at the fall from a height of 7.0 m was 7.79 m s^{−1}. The height at which a water drop achieves a constant speed depends on its size, but it can be claimed that it is at least 12 m for the droplet diameter used in the experiment ( [Zhou et_al, 2002]).
The energy of a drop hitting the surface of a liquid has a direct effect on the form generated on the surface and the size of the form. At a low value of the energy of the falling drop, only a small wave is generated. In this case, assuming incompressibility of the liquid and disregarding the energy required for surface deformation, the kinetic energy of the falling drop is likely to be largely transformed into the wave spread energy. Similar conclusions were formulated by  [Okawa et_al (2006)]. The authors found that, as a result of the impact of a drop with a very small diameter (d = 0.51 mm) and a very low velocity value (v = 1.4 m s^{−1}), i.e., when the We number was low, the drop was absorbed in the liquid and then circular ripples surrounding the impact site were formed.
At a higher velocity of the falling drop, some of the kinetic energy transferred to the liquid particles around the impact site is sufficient for the fingering rim of the crown formed at the early stage to scatter into many satellite droplets (traditional splash). Similar findings were reported by a number of other studies ( [Okawa et_al, 2006];  [Pan and Hung, 2010];  [Rioboo et_al, 2003];  [Rodriguez and Mesler, 1985]; and  [Wang and Chen, 2000]).
A further increase in the velocity of the falling drop and in its kinetic energy leads to inward bending of the crown spikes and, ultimately, closing of the dome on the liquid surface. The formation of the dome may be related to a sufficiently high drop fall velocity. The vacuum arising behind the drop sucks in the forming crown walls (film closure).  [Pan and Hung (2010)] found that transformation into a closed crown is essentially determined by the balance between the upward momentum and downward pull via gravity and surface tension.
It should also be noted that the dimensionless height determined for the water system reached a maximum value of 2.3 (Fig. 9), which corresponds to the assumption that this drop, falling from 7.0 m, loses about 56% of energy due to existing air drag. The maximum value of the dimensionless height for both petroleum substances was approximately 3.4 and thus, these drops, falling from the highest analyzed height, lost about 14% more energy than a drop of water. This result is undoubtedly related to the deformation of the drops of petroleum substances from the spherical shape, which was observed on the recordings, for the two highest analyzed heights (5.0 and 7.0 m).
However, although the percentage of energy loss described above is significant, it should be kept in mind that when increasing the drop height for a water system, this percentage could still rise because, as has already been discussed, the water drop has not obtained a constant velocity.
B. Use of dimensionless numbers for description of splash forms
As early as in 1985, Rodriguez and Mesler published the results of their investigations, in which they interpreted the course of the splash phenomenon based on the dimensionless Fr number and Re number. The use of these two and the other dimensionless numbers [Eqs. (1)–(4)] seems to be fully reasonable, as they associate the key values characterizing the liquid with the dynamics of the drop fall, thereby facilitating description of various aspects of the analyzed phenomenon.
On the basis of primary numbers, it can be stated that factors that have a key effect on the course of the splash phenomenon should be divided into two groups. The first one comprises properties of liquids, e.g., surface tension, viscosity, and density. The other group is associated with physical factors that determine the kinetic energy of the falling drop, i.e., drop size (diameter), density, and velocity. It is worth noting that density was included in both groups of determinants.
As shown in Fig. 9, except for the Fr number, which is virtually identical for both petrol and diesel, the numbers calculated from Eqs. (1), (2), and (4) differentiate the analyzed systems. In the case of the Fr number [Eq. (3)], the absence of differentiation is related to the fact that this number is based on the drop velocity and the density of the liquid, which were highly similar in both petroleum products. As all primary numbers are greater than 1, it can be seen that inertial forces are dominant over the surface tension [Fig. 9(a)], as well as the viscous [Fig. 9(b)] and gravitational forces [Fig. 9(c)].
The literature contains publications proving that factors such as density, velocity, and diameter of the drop exert a directly proportional effect on the size and generation rate of the splash form ( [Coghe et_al, 1999];  [Cole, 2007];  [Cossali et_al, 2004]; and  [1997]). Further, although there are also papers presenting investigations conducted on various materials and considering changes in the surface tension and/or viscosity of liquids ( [Rioboo et_al, 2003];  [Vander Wal et_al, 2006a]; and  [2006b]), we failed to find a study presenting a direct impact of these properties on the size of the splash form. Some investigations show that higher viscosity of liquids is accompanied by lower dynamics of the splash phenomenon: the generated crown is characterized by greater “uniformity” ( [Vander Wal et_al, 2006b]) and its disintegration into secondary droplets is inhibited ( [Pan and Hung, 2010]). A decline in the value of surface tension may accelerate this process.
Due to the fact that the K number [Eq. (4)] includes all factors that determine the kinetic energy (density, velocity, and diameter) of the drop and also the values that determine the increase in the liquid’s ability to spread (viscosity and surface tension), this seems to be the most suitable for describing the dynamics of the generated splash forms.
In other words, the K number [Eq. (8)] shows the relation between the inertial forces (F_{I}), which are directly proportional, and interfacial (F_{σ}) and viscous forces (F_{μ}), which are inversely proportional to it,
Furthermore, in the case of the K number, values greater than 1 were obtained. This result proves that inertial forces dominate over the forces of viscosity and surface tension in the analyzed systems.
The theoretical considerations together with the experimental results reveals similarity in the course of the curves in the graph showing changes in the rate of splash form generation in relation to the height of the drop fall (Fig. 8) and in the graph presenting changes in the values of the K number depending on the dimensionless height [Fig. 9(d)]. In both cases, the curve for the petrol system is the highest and that for the diesel fuel system is the lowest.
A review of the available literature very slightly indicates studies of determination of the correlation between the dynamics of splash form generation and the properties of liquids. For droplets falling on fluid films, the role of viscosity is important in generation of a kinematic “gradient” that can accelerate (low viscosity) or decelerate (high viscosity) the advancing fluid front. Taking into account surface tension, the higher it is, the more inhibited the splashing is, where the tiny droplets are released ( [Vander Wal et_al, 2006b]).
 [Cossali et_al (2004)],  [Lee et_al (2011)], and  [Liang et_al (2014)] investigated the phenomenon of formation of the crown in liquid systems. They observed that the height of the crown increased with the increasing We number. Our investigations have confirmed this finding and proved that this statement is true not only for water but also for other liquids and for various forms, such as the wave, semi-closed dome, and dome.
 [Liang et_al (2014)] found that an increase in the We number had no effect on the diameter of the crown. This conclusion has not been supported in our experiments, which may have been due to the differences in the adopted methodological assumptions. In the study conducted by  [Liang et_al (2014)], the crown diameter, which was unchanged along the increase in We, was measured at specific moments. By contrast, the crown width was measured in our experiment at its maximum height, and the higher the We value (resulting from the greater droplet velocity), the larger the splash form. Therefore, the values of both h_{max} [Fig. 6(a)] and w_{h_max} [Fig. 6(b)] in our study increased (to reach a plateau) with the increasing speed of the falling drop. This is consistent with the results reported by  [Lee et_al (2011)], suggesting that the height of the crown shows a similar trend to that of the diameter of this form.
The study by  [Wang et_al (2015)], describing the impact of a water drop on various surfaces, provides critical values of the Re number inducing changes in the character of the splash phenomenon. The authors have concluded that when Re = 500, there is no splash and a wave moves outwards from the impact centre. In turn, although a crown occurs at Re = 1000, its rim is quite strong and withstands the surface tension and the viscous force; hence, no instability or break-up of the splashing liquids is noted. At Re = 2000, the liquid ejected from the neck of the impaction is unstable and finally breaks up into many small droplets at the end rim of the crown. These conclusions have partly been confirmed in our experiments. Indeed, only a wave is generated after a droplet fall on the surface of a liquid at the lower Re values, and an increase in the Re number results in formation of a standard crown and subsequent detachment of secondary droplets from its spikes. However, the limit values have not been confirmed. This may have been related to the differences in the experimental design, e.g., the drop diameter in the study conducted by  [Wang et_al (2015)] ranged from 50 to 147.7 μm and its velocity was from 8.9 to 32.3 m s^{−1}. Additionally, the speed values were not actual velocities achieved by the drops of these sizes; instead, they were values selected for the simulation in a way that ensured the Re values specified above.
Investigations of petroleum products were presented in the paper by  [Murphy et_al (2015)]. The authors found that the splash generated in petroleum products at such high Re values was characterized by formation of a subsurface cavity and a crown that closed into a bubble canopy, which has been confirmed in our experiment. Unfortunately, it was not possible to determine the Re limit value above which a dome was formed in any of the analyzed liquid systems. The substantial differences in the values of this parameter identified for the systems are associated with the considerable differences in the viscosity of the liquids used.
As already described, the analysis of the dimensionless numbers and kinetic energy (Figs. 5 and 9) facilitated determination of the limit values only for the We number (waves formed up to a value of We = 200 and crowns emerged at values above We = 220) and for the K number (waves formed below K = 1900, crowns were generated above K = 2600, and domes formed above K = 22 200 in the petrol, water, and diesel fuel systems). The limit value of the We number is consistent with previous reports ( [Cossali et_al, 1997] and  [Rieber and Frohn, 1999]). Although the cited papers were focused on investigations of the impact of a drop on a thin film and the We = 200 value facilitated distinguishing the deposition and splashing phases, this conclusion can be compared with findings concerning a drop splash in a deep pool. Since the deposition phase is similar to the phase of absorption of the drop by the liquid (low We) and the splashing phase is similar in both cases, the fingering rim of the crown formed at the early stage may scatter into many satellite droplets. Additionally,  [Pan and Hung (2010)] have found that, for We > 2000 (in the case of a water droplet), the upwardly ejected sheet may eventually convene at the dome of the cavity, thus leading to closure of the crown. This conclusion is consistent with our observations, where a value of We = 1770 was obtained when a semi-closed dome (3.0 m) formed on the surface of water in the latter case. In turn, in the former case, a value of We = 2450 was noted when a dome (5.0 m) formed on the water. Similar values of the We number have also been noted for cases where a semi-closed dome formed in the latter case (1.0 m) and when a dome formed in the former case (1.5 m) in the petrol system. However, completely different We values have been obtained for the diesel fuel system. According to  [Murphy et_al (2015)], this situation is related to the viscosity of the analyzed liquids. These authors have shown that the limit of the We value, at which the dome closes (We > 2000), applies to liquids of low viscosity (here, petrol and water—see Table I), whereas for liquids with high viscosity (here, diesel fuel—see Table I) this is We > 3000. Our results confirm this conclusion because the We values for both cases when the domes closed in the diesel fuel system (5.0 and 7.0 m) were above 3000.
As for the K number, similar observations were reported by  [Okawa et_al (2006)], who estimated its value at approximately 2100 between phases referred to as crown formation without break-up (herein, wave) and crown formation with break-up (herein, crown). Similarly,  [Cossali et_al (1997)] and  [Castrejón-Pita et_al (2016)] presented the critical K value. Cossali et_al suggested that the onset of splashing takes place at K ∼ 2000, but by contrast, Castrejón-Pita et_al reported the onset at K = 800. As the authors concluded, the decrease in the K value may have been caused by extra inertia added to the system in their experiments ( [Castrejón-Pita et_al, 2016]). Additionally,  [Riboux and Gordillo (2014)] exemplified also the difficulty in distinguishing between prompt and crown splash. Finally,  [Josserand and Thoroddsen (2016)] conducted that for impacts at K ∼ 3000 one can expect the crown splash.
Another indicator that provides the opportunity to distinguish different types of splash was proposed by  [Deegan et_al (2008)]. Based on the equation c=We⋅Re, the authors determined the areas of occurrence of “drop impacts with and without crown splash.” According to these researchers, the above dependence for these areas was a fixed value of 2.6 × 10^{4}. Applying the c indicator to the analysis of the results obtained in our experiments also presented the possibility of separating the areas of occurrence of different splash forms (Fig. 10). The first line (c1 = 1.86 × 10^{4}) was determined based on the values of the We and Re numbers for those cases when the spikes began to appear on the wave and thus separated the areas of formation of waves and crowns in all the investigated systems. The second line (c2 = 27.1 × 10^{4}) was determined analogously for cases when the domes began to close and it separated the regimes of semi-closed domes and domes in three analyzed systems.
It is worth noting that the obtained coefficient c1 was close to that provided by  [Deegan et_al (2008)]. The difference in the obtained values could be a result of the fact that the assumptions of the two experiments differed (e.g., liquids with other properties were analyzed and drops of other diameters and velocity were used) but, above all, because different forms of splash were defined. Although “drop impact with crown splash” definitely corresponds to our crown form, “drop impact without crown splash” cannot necessarily be unambiguously compared with our wave-form.
Unfortunately, neither the K number nor the c coefficient enabled a clear separation between the areas of the occurrence of crowns from those of semi-closed domes. The reason for this may be that the transition between these two forms is the least characteristic and defining it may often depend on the investigator’s subjective decision. Other forms of splash are much more characteristic and their formation is managed by separate mechanisms ( [Deegan et_al, 2008] and  [Zhang et_al, 2010]).
Summarizing the discussion, it should be noted that both the K number and the c coefficient are based on the combination of the We and Re numbers and are thus based on the same properties of the liquids (K=c^{45}). In connection with the above, it is not surprising that, in a very similar way, both indicators separate exactly the same areas where characteristic forms of splash are formed after the drop’s impact.
V. CONCLUSIONS
The experiments enabled us to observe and define four splash forms, i.e., waves, crowns, semi-closed domes, and domes, generated in the analyzed systems. The splash, characterized by the height and width of these forms, was highly similar in the case of water and petrol and slightly different for the diesel fuel.
None of the analyzed properties of the liquids, i.e., density, viscosity, and surface tension, when considered separately explained the differences observed in the size and rate of the growth of the successive splash forms. Based on the combination of these properties, the differences were successfully described in two ways. The first was the fitting of two lines into the relationship between Weber (We) and Reynolds (Re) numbers. For all measurement systems (i.e., water, petrol, and diesel fuel) these lines separated the areas, in which the waves and crowns occurred and in which the dome is closing. The values of c coefficient (defined as c=We⋅Re) attained the values of c1 = 1.86 × 10^{4} and c2 = 27.1 × 10^{4}, respectively, for the first and second border. Second, the separation of the same areas was obtained according to the K number. The crowns were created for K greater than 2600. For a K greater than 22 200, the domes were the form of splash phenomenon.
As the values of the K number were much greater than 1, it was proved that inertial forces dominated over the forces of viscosity and surface tension in all the investigated systems.
