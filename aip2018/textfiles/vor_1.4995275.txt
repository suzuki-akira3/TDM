Thermal quenching of the yellow luminescence in GaN
We observed varying thermal quenching behavior of the yellow luminescence band near 2.2 eV in different GaN samples. In spite of the different behavior, the yellow band in all the samples is caused by the same defect—the YL1 center. In conductive n-type GaN, the YL1 band quenches with exponential law, and the Arrhenius plot reveals an ionization energy of ∼0.9 eV for the YL1 center. In semi-insulating GaN, an abrupt and tunable quenching of the YL1 band is observed, where the apparent activation energy in the Arrhenius plot is not related to the ionization energy of the defect. In this case, the ionization energy can be found by analyzing the shift of the characteristic temperature of PL quenching with excitation intensity. We conclude that only one defect, namely, the YL1 center, is responsible for the yellow band in undoped and doped GaN samples grown by different techniques.
I. INTRODUCTION
Gallium nitride is an important semiconductor material for light-emitting and high-power electronic device applications. Point defects in GaN and other III-nitrides significantly affect the performance of these devices. In particular, impurities and vacancies are proposed to be the main source of nonradiative recombination in nitride semiconductors, which reduces the internal quantum efficiency of GaN-based optoelectronic devices [1,2]. Point defects also reduce power and cause degradation of GaN-based transistors [3,4]. However, the identity and properties of point defects in GaN are poorly understood. In particular, the identity of the ubiquitous yellow luminescence (YL) band with a maximum at 2.2 eV has been subject of hot debate for decades. This defect-related broad band is commonly observed in photoluminescence (PL) spectra from GaN grown by different techniques, including molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE), metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), and hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE) [5].
Recently, we reported on the discovery of fine structure of the YL band in GaN [6]. This band with unique fingerprints was named the YL1 band to distinguish it from other possible defects that may cause YL bands near 2.2 eV. The zero-phonon line (ZPL) of the YL1 band at 2.57 eV (at lowest temperatures) or 2.59 eV (at 50 K) is followed by pseudo-local and LO lattice phonon replicas. The energy level of the YL1 center is located at 916 ± 3 meV above the valence band [6]. After a careful analysis of the PL spectra, we have found the YL1 band with its fine structure in at least 20 GaN samples, including undoped GaN grown by HVPE, C-doped and Si-doped GaN grown by MOCVD, and undoped GaN grown by MBE. In many other samples, where the fine structure cannot be observed, the YL1 band can be recognized from its position, shape and other characteristics, such as electron- and hole-capture coefficients (1.1 × 10^{−13} and 3 × 10^{−7 }cm^{3}/s, respectively) [5,7]. This finding proves that the broad PL band near 2.2 eV is caused by electron transitions via a single energy level in the bandgap. The nearly Gaussian, slightly asymmetrical shape of the YL1 band is due to strong electron-phonon coupling and can be explained with a one-dimensional configuration coordinate model. However, a question remains whether the PL band at about 2.2 eV is caused by one defect (the YL1 center), or there are other types of defects that cause the bands in this part of the PL spectrum but may be difficult to distinguish from the YL1 band. Many attempts to answer this question have been undertaken by theorists and experimentalists in recent years as elaborated on below.
First-principles calculations suggest several defects that may cause the YL band with a maximum near 2.2 eV. For almost two decades, density functional theory (DFT) calculations predicted that the gallium vacancy (V_{Ga}) and V_{Ga}-containing complexes, such as V_{Ga}O_{N}, are major candidates for the YL defect in n-type GaN [8,9]. However, recent calculations, using hybrid functionals, have shown that the 3–/2– transition level of the V_{Ga} or the 2–/– transition level of the V_{Ga}O_{N} are much deeper than they were found in the original DFT calculations and now do not agree with the position of the YL band [10]. On the other hand, the C_{N} defect was initially disregarded by theorists relying on the DFT method due to its predicted shallow level, whereas modern hybrid functional theory corrected the calculations, bringing the –/0 level of the C_{N} to desired 0.9 eV above the valence band maximum [11]. Another group proposed that the C_{N}O_{N} complex is a better candidate to explain the YL band [12]. In addition to the C-containing defects, the V_{Ga}O_{N}–2H and V_{Ga}–3H complexes are also expected to cause PL bands with positions and shapes similar to the YL band [10]. Note that thermodynamic transition levels and ZPLs for the above defects are not the same (they differ by ∼0.2 eV). Therefore, PL bands originating from different defects should be possible to distinguish in experiment.
For the majority of the experimental studies, the YL band is insufficiently resolved, because of either the low sample quality or non-optimal measurement conditions (temperature, excitation intensity). Moreover, the position and shape of the same PL band reported in different works may differ if the measured PL spectra are inadequately corrected for spectral response of the measurement system. These factors make it difficult to prove or disprove theoretical predictions that several types of defects could cause PL bands with a maximum near 2.2 eV.
One of the approaches to distinguish PL bands related to different types of defects but having similar shape and position in the PL spectrum is to analyze thermal quenching of PL. The intensity, I^{PL}, of defect-related PL typically has the following temperature dependence [13]:
where I^{PL}(0) is the PL intensity in the limit of low temperature, C is a constant, k is Boltzmann's constant, and E_{A} is the activation energy of thermal quenching. According to Eq. (1), in the region of the thermal quenching, the PL intensity decreases exponentially with increasing temperature as
The parameter E_{A} is expected to be equal to the distance between the thermodynamic transition level of the defect and the valence band maximum. Two different defects may have similar optical transitions (which determine the positions of the PL band maxima) but different thermodynamic transition levels due to different Franck-Condon shifts caused by electron-phonon coupling. Armitage et_al [14] reported on two YL bands in GaN that have similar positions but very different E_{A} determined from the thermal quenching of PL: E_{A} = 1040 ± 60 meV in C-doped GaN sample and E_{A} = 650 ± 40 meV in undoped GaN. From these results, the authors concluded that the YL band in semi-insulating, C-doped GaN is caused by a carbon-related defect, while the YL band in conductive, unintentionally doped GaN is caused by the V_{Ga} defect. This viewpoint has since become very popular in the nitrides community.
In our experiments on a variety of GaN samples (conductive and semi-insulating, undoped, C-, and Si-doped) grown by different techniques, different types of thermal quenching of the YL band were observed, with E_{A} ranging from 0.06 to 1.8 eV (Fig. 1). We will show in this work that the YL band in different GaN samples is caused by the same defect, the YL1 center. Different temperature behavior of the YL band in these samples will be explained.
II. EXPERIMENTAL
We studied thermal quenching of the YL band from three types of GaN samples grown on c-plane sapphire substrate. An undoped, 3 μm-thick GaN layer (sample svt750) was grown by MBE. The room-temperature concentration of free electrons in this sample is 3 × 10^{16} cm^{−3} according to Hall effect measurements and 4 × 10^{15} cm^{−3} according to time-resolved PL measurements [7]. Si-doped, 1.5 μm-thick GaN layers were grown by MOCVD. The room-temperature concentration of free electrons is 3 × 10^{19} cm^{−3} (Hall effect) or (1–9)×10^{19} cm^{−3} (time-resolved PL) in sample cvd3533 and 7 × 10^{17} cm^{−3} (Hall effect) or 3 × 10^{17} cm^{−3} (time-resolved PL) in sample cvd3540 [7]. Two semi-insulating GaN layers were grown by MOCVD. The 3.6 μm-thick GaN layer (sample LG), grown at Lumilog (France), was doped with Fe to compensate shallow donors. The 3.1 μm-thick GaN layer (cvd4229) was doped with C by using low reactor pressure of 76 Torr.
Steady-state PL was excited with an unfocused He-Cd laser (30 mW, 325 nm), dispersed by a 1200 rules/mm grating in a 0.3 m monochromator and detected by a cooled photomultiplier tube. Neutral density filters were used to attenuate the excitation power density, P_{exc}, from 0.2 to 10^{−4 }W/cm^{2}. A closed-cycle optical cryostat was used for temperatures between 15 and 320 K, and a high-temperature optical cryostat (model VPF-700 from Janis Research Company) was used for temperatures between 150 and 700 K. The PL spectra were corrected for the spectral response of the measurement system. The absolute internal quantum efficiency of PL, η, is defined as η=I^{PL}/G, where I^{PL} is the PL intensity from a particular PL band and G is the concentration of electron-hole pairs created by the laser per second in the same volume. To find η for a particular PL band, we compared its integrated intensity with the PL intensity obtained from a calibrated GaN sample [15,16]. All of the samples were studied under identical conditions.
III. RESULTS
A. Shape of the yellow luminescence band
Normalized low-temperature PL spectra from selected GaN samples are shown in Fig. 2. The main defect-related PL band in these samples is the YL1 band with a maximum at 2.2 eV. The PL spectrum for conductive n-type samples also contains much weaker ultraviolet luminescence (UVL) band with the main peak at about 3.27 eV. In PL spectra from semi-insulating GaN samples (LG and cvd4229), the blue luminescence (BL2) band with a maximum at 3.0 eV and ZPL at 3.34 eV is observed.
The BL2 band, attributed to a complex defect containing carbon and hydrogen atoms [17], is observed only in semi-insulating GaN samples grown by MOCVD or HVPE. Under continuous exposure with above-bandgap light, the intensity of the BL2 band decreases with time (PL bleaching), and the YL1 band intensity increases concurrently. For example, for sample LG, at low excitation intensity (P_{exc} < 0.001 W/cm^{2}), the intensities of the BL2 and YL1 bands were nearly equal (η ≈ 0.05) before high-intensity (P_{exc} = 0.2 W/cm^{2}) laser exposure. After 4 hours of high-intensity laser exposure, the BL2 intensity decreased by a factor of 4.5, and the YL1 intensity increased by a factor of 3.5. Note that the absolute increase of the quantum efficiency of the YL1 band (Δη ≈ 0.12) was markedly larger than the absolute decrease of the quantum efficiency of the BL2 band (Δη ≈ –0.04). This may indicate that other types of hydrogen-containing complexes (e.g., C_{N}H_{2} or C_{N}O_{N}H_{2}) exist and possibly inactive, whereas their dissociation creates the carbon-related defect responsible for the YL1 band. Figure 2 shows the PL spectrum for sample LG after more than 4 h of high-intensity laser exposure.
The shape of the YL1 band was simulated with the following expression obtained from a one-dimensional configuration coordinate model [18]:
Here, ImaxPL is the PL intensity at the band maximum, S_{e} is the Huang-Rhys factor for the excited state, ℏω and ℏω_{max} are the photon energy and position of the band maximum, E0*=E_{0}+0.5ℏΩ, E_{0} is the ZPL energy, and ℏΩ is the energy of the dominant phonon mode in the excited state. The simulated shape, shown in Fig. 2 with the thin, long-dashed line, is identical to the shape of the YL1 band in undoped MOCVD and HVPE GaN samples [6]. However, the band maximum is blue-shifted by about 0.02 eV as compared to the YL1 band in Ref [6].
The slightly shifted position of the YL band in the studied samples can be explained by the following reasons. For MBE GaN sample (svt750) at T = 18 K, electron transitions from the conduction band to deep-level defects (e-A transitions) dominate over transitions from shallow donors to the deep-level defects, the so-called donor-acceptor pair (DAP) transitions. This results in a blue shift by about 0.02 eV for defect-related bands (both the UVL and YL1) as compared to undoped MOCVD and HVPE GaN samples where the DAP transitions dominate up to 40–50 K. In Si-doped MOCVD GaN samples (cvd3533 and cvd3540), the shallow donor level splits into a band that merges with the conduction band. This causes the blue shift of all PL features by about 0.02 eV to higher energy in these samples [6]. The shift of PL bands (exciton, BL2, and YL1) for semi-insulating GaN is attributed to large stress in the GaN layer.
Identification of the yellow band as the YL1 band in the studied samples is strongly supported by the observation of the ZPL at about 2.59 eV (Fig. 3). The intensity of the ZPL line amounts to 1% of that of the YL1 band maximum, same value as for previously studied HVPE GaN samples [6]. The ZPL and phonon-related fine structure were better resolved after subtraction from the experimental dependence of the shape simulated by using Eq. (3). Following the procedure suggested in Ref [6], we have found the thermodynamic transition level for defects responsible for the YL1 and UVL bands. In particular, E_{A} = 920 ± 3 meV for sample LG and E_{A} = 916 ± 1 meV for sample svt750. For the latter, the transition level for the shallow acceptor (UVL-related defect) is 223 ± 1 meV, which exactly matches the value found for GaN grown by HVPE and MOCVD [6]. This finding indicates that the UVL band in undoped GaN grown by different methods (MBE, MOCVD, and HVPE) has the same origin (most likely, the shallow Mg_{Ga} acceptor).
With increasing temperature, the full width at half maximum (FWHM or W) of the YL1 band increases. The W(T) dependence was studied in detail for several GaN:Si samples (Fig. 4), where the quantum efficiency of the YL1 band is very high (η ≈ 0.02 – 0.10 at P_{exc} = 0.01 W/cm^{2} and T = 300 K). This dependence can be fitted with the following expression obtained in the one-dimensional configuration coordinate model as [19]:
Here, W(0) is the FWHM in the limit of low temperatures (about 0.40 eV). The only fitting parameter in this expression is the energy of the dominant phonon mode in the excited state. The best fit reveals ℏΩ = 56 meV. This value is expected to be more accurate than the value of 52 meV previously found from analysis of the bandwidth at temperatures up to 400 K only [5,20]. Note that this is the effective mode, whereas the actually resolved phonon modes for the YL1 band have the values of 39.5 meV (pseudo-local mode) and 91.5 meV (LO lattice mode) [6].
B. Thermal quenching of the yellow luminescence in conductive n-type GaN
Figure 5 shows the temperature dependence of the YL1 band intensity (normalized at room temperature) for conductive n-type GaN samples. Examining the said dependences and their fits with Eq. (2), shown in Fig. 1, one may conclude that the yellow band in different samples is caused by different defects because the apparent activation energy, E_{A}, of the thermal quenching is markedly different. We will show below that in fact the thermal quenching of the yellow band can be fitted with Eq. (1) with parameters of the defect responsible for the PL band being the same for different samples.
The thermal quenching of defect-related PL in conductive n-type GaN is caused by thermal emission of holes from the defect level to the valence band [21]. The activation energy of thermal quenching is equal to the ionization energy of this defect. The characteristic temperature, T_{0}, at which the quenching begins, can be found from the condition Cexp(−E_{A}/kT_{0})=1. The expression for the parameter C has been obtained from solution of rate equations for competing electron-hole recombination flows through defect states in an n-type semiconductor [15,21]
Here, τ_{0} and η_{0} are the PL lifetime and the absolute PL quantum efficiency, respectively, of the PL band at low temperatures, when the thermal quenching of the PL can be ignored, N_{v} is the effective density of states in the valence band, C_{pA} is the hole-capture coefficient for the defect, and g is the degeneracy of the defect level.
In the fits shown in Fig. 5, we assumed that the same defect (the YL1 center) is responsible for the yellow band in all the samples and kept the main parameters of the defect (C_{pA} and E_{A}) fixed. The most accurate values of these parameters were found from the fit of the I^{PL}(T) dependence for undoped GaN sample (svt750), where the PL intensity changes by more than three orders of magnitude during thermal quenching. Possible errors in the value of η_{0} in Eq. (5) do not play any significant role for the studied samples because η_{0}≪1. The PL lifetime of the yellow band was determined in time-resolved PL measurements: τ_{0} = 0.2 μs, 30 μs, and 2 ms for samples cvd3533, cvd3540, and svt750, respectively. These values roughly agree with the concentrations of free electrons in these samples at room temperature determined from the Hall effect measurements (n = 3 × 10^{19}, 7 × 10^{17}, and 3 × 10^{16} cm^{−3}, respectively). Indeed, τ_{0}=(CnAn){−1}, where C_{nA} is the electron-capture coefficient (C_{nA} = 1.1 × 10^{−13 }cm^{3}/s for the YL1 center) [7]. We estimate that the values of E_{A} and C_{pA} may have errors of ±50 meV and plus-minus half order of magnitude, respectively, even for sample svt750, where the thermal quenching is observed in a very wide intensity range.
The slow variation of the YL1 intensity at T < T_{0}, was accounted for in the fit as an exponential decrease of the I^{PL}(0) value in Eq. (1) (dashed curve in Fig. 5). This variation can neither be attributed to the thermal emission of holes to the valence band, nor to the thermal emission of electrons from a donor level to the conduction band [21]. One reason for this weak dependence may be a slow decrease of C_{pA} for the YL1 center or a slow increase of the hole-capture coefficient for the dominant nonradiative center with increasing temperature. However, it is more likely that the weak temperature dependence of the YL1 band intensity is caused by gradual increase of the surface band bending [22].
C. Thermal quenching of the yellow luminescence in semi-insulating GaN
Quenching of the YL band in semi-insulating GaN samples (LG and cvd4229) is very abrupt. The apparent activation energy is much larger than the defect ionization energy. Moreover, fitted parameter C_{pA} is ridiculous when attempting to fit the thermal quenching in these samples with Eqs. (1) and (5). We explain thermal quenching of the YL1 band in these samples with a model of abrupt and tunable thermal quenching proposed in Ref [15]. Indeed, the region of the thermal quenching of the YL1 band in these samples shifts to higher temperatures with increasing excitation intensity (Fig. 6).
The drop of the YL1 intensity is very abrupt, giving the apparent activation energy in the region of PL quenching as about 2.6 eV for sample cvd4229 (Fig. 6). The dependence of the characteristic quenching temperature T_{0} on the excitation intensity is shown in Fig. 7 for two semi-insulating GaN samples. The data can be fitted with the following expression [15]:
where E_{A} is the ionization energy for the YL1 center and B is a sample-dependent constant,
Here, η_{0} is the quantum efficiency of the YL1 band at T < T_{0}, N_{v} = 3.2 × 10^{15}T_{0}^{3/2 }cm^{−3} for GaN, (N_{A} – N_{D}) is the concentration of uncompensated YL1 centers, and g = 2 is the assumed degeneracy of the YL1 level. From the best fit, we find that E_{A} = 870 meV and B = 1.6 × 10^{27}T_{0}^{3/2}. Furthermore, by taking the value of C_{pA} determined above from the thermal quenching of the YL1 band in conductive n-type GaN samples (C_{pA} ≈ 2 × 10^{−7 }cm^{3}/s), we estimate from Eq. (7) that (N_{A} – N_{D}) ≈ 10^{17} cm^{−3}.
IV. DISCUSSION
In undoped, conductive n-type GaN (n = 10^{16}–10^{17} cm^{−3}), thermal quenching of the YL1 band begins at T_{0} ≈ 400–500 K, and the activation energy of this quenching is about 0.9 eV. In samples with higher concentration of electrons (e.g., Si-doped GaN), the quenching begins at higher temperatures. Equations (1) and (5), which describe the thermal quenching, can be re-written as
where τ_{therm} is the characteristic time of thermal emission of bound holes to the valence band
The PL quenching begins at T_{0} that can be found from τ_{therm}(T_{0})=τ_{0}=(CnAn){−1}. It follows from Eq. (9) that for two samples (A and B) with n different by an order of magnitude (n_{A}/n_{B} = 0.1), the positions of the characteristic temperatures in the Arrhenius plot (10^{3}/T_{0}_{A} and 10^{3}/T_{0}_{B}) are displaced by
For E_{A} = 0.9 eV, Δ ≈ 0.2 K^{−1}. This agrees with displacements between I^{PL}(T) dependences in the region of exponential decrease of the YL1 intensity. Indeed, for samples with concentration of free electrons (as well as PL lifetimes) differing by about two orders of magnitude, the quenching regions are displaced by about 0.4 K^{−1} in Fig. 5. For sample cvd3533 with very high concentration of free electrons, the thermal quenching is expected to start at temperatures above 700 K, inaccessible in our experiment. Thus, the apparently different PL quenching behavior observed for GaN samples with different concentrations of free electrons can be explained by different lifetimes of the YL1 band. From the fits of the I^{PL}(T) dependences we have found E_{A} ≈ 0.9 eV, which agrees with the ionization energy of the YL1 center in the limit of low temperature (E_{A} = 0.916 eV). Parameter C_{pA} for the YL1 center (2 × 10^{−7 }cm^{3}/s) is also close to previously reported values (3 × 10^{−7 }cm^{3}/s in Ref [5] and 6 × 10^{−7 }cm^{3}/s in Ref [12]). The scatter in C_{pA} values is mostly caused by the scatter in E_{A}, which determines the slope of PL quenching [see Eqs. (1) and (5)]. For different samples, E_{A} varies between 0.8 and 0.9 eV and the calculated C_{pA} may vary between 1 × 10^{−7} and 1 × 10^{−6 }cm^{3}/s with the mean value of about 3 × 10^{−7 }cm^{3}/s.
In high-resistivity GaN samples, the YL1 band is the dominant defect-related band (at least after long exposure with above-bandgap light). The apparently large “activation energy” of the YL1 quenching obtained from the I^{PL}(T) dependence (1.8 eV for sample LG and 2.6 eV for sample cvd4229) has no relation to the ionization energy of the YL1 center. In fact, PL quenching is abrupt and tunable by the excitation intensity [15]. In this case, the ionization energy of the YL1 center can be found from the shift of the characteristic temperature of the PL quenching with excitation intensity. This procedure reveals E_{A} = 0.87 ± 0.05 eV, which agrees with the ionization energy of the YL1 center in the limit of low temperatures (E_{A} = 0.916 ± 0.003 eV). Note that E_{A} determined from thermal quenching of PL is much less accurate than the value determined from the position of ZPL. By combining the results of the current work and those reported in Ref [17], we conclude that the defect responsible for the BL2 band (C_{N}H_{i} or C_{N}O_{N}H_{i}) loses its hydrogen under extended above-bandgap illumination and converts into defect responsible for the YL1 band (C_{N} or C_{N}O_{N}).
The new observation of abrupt and tunable quenching of PL compels us to look at this phenomenon as universal for semi-insulating semiconductors, rather than being limited to the particular samples investigated. It was first reported and explained in detail for the BL1 band caused by the Zn_{Ga} acceptor in GaN:Zn [15] and later discovered for the UVL band in undoped and Mg-doped GaN [23,24] and for the OL band in Li-doped ZnO [25]. Examples for other semi-insulating semiconductors, albeit less explored, can be found in Refs [13] and  [26]. The abrupt and tunable quenching is caused by the inverse population of charge carriers under continuous illumination at low temperatures. This happens thanks to certain properties of the dominant nonradiative recombination center in the semiconductor: it should have high capture cross-section for both electrons and holes [15]. Observation of very similar thermal quenching of the YL1 band in C-doped and Fe-doped GaN indicates that the dominant nonradiative center is likely to be the same defect in both cases.
Finally, we believe that the yellow band studied in Ref [14] is caused by the YL1 center, both in undoped n-type GaN and semi-insulating GaN:C samples grown by MBE. The concentration of carbon in nominally undoped GaN sample was already very high (6 × 10^{16} cm^{−3}) to explain the relatively strong YL1 band. The PL bands were not well resolved and thus the shape of the yellow band could not be analyzed in that research. The difference in the apparent activation energy of the yellow band quenching (1.04 and 0.65 eV for the semi-insulating and conductive GaN samples, respectively) cannot serve as a proof that two different types of defects cause the yellow band in different GaN samples.
V. CONCLUSION
In spite of the fact that thermal quenching of the yellow luminescence band in our experiments is very different, we discern the YL1 band with a maximum at 2.22 eV and ZPL at 2.59 eV in all studied GaN samples, including undoped GaN grown by MBE, Si-doped GaN samples grown by MOCVD, and semi-insulating MOCVD-grown GaN samples doped with Fe or C. It appears that only one defect, presumably C_{N} or C_{N}O_{N}, is responsible for the yellow band in various GaN samples. The apparent activation energy of the thermal quenching of the YL1 band may vary between 0.06 and 2.6 eV in different samples. However, the ionization energy of the related defect is about 0.9 eV in all cases, what can be proven by careful analysis of the thermal quenching behavior.
