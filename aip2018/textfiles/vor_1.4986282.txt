Nonlinear mechanisms of two-dimensional wave-wave transformations in the initially coupled acoustic structure
The present study concerns two-dimensional nonlinear mechanisms of bidirectional and unidirectional channeling of longitudinal and shear waves emerging in the locally resonant acoustic structure. The system under consideration comprises an oscillatory chain of the axially coupled masses. Each mass of the chain is subject to the local linear potential along the lateral direction and incorporates the lightweight internal rotator. In the present work, we demonstrate the emergence of special resonant regimes of complete bi- and unidirectional transitions between the longitudinal and the shear waves of the locally resonant chain. These regimes are manifested by the two-dimensional energy channeling between the longitudinal and the shear traveling waves in the recurrent as well as the irreversible fashion. We show that the spatial control of the two dimensional energy flow between the longitudinal and the shear waves is solely governed by the motion of the internal rotators. Nonlinear analysis of the regimes of a bidirectional wave channeling unveils their global bifurcation structure and predicts the zones of their spontaneous transitions from a complete bi-directional wave channeling to the one-directional entrapment. An additional regime of a complete irreversible resonant transformation of the longitudinal wave into a shear wave is analyzed in the study. The intrinsic mechanism governing the unidirectional wave reorientation is described analytically. The results of the analysis of both mechanisms are substantiated by the numerical simulations of the full model and are found to be in a good agreement.
I. INTRODUCTION
Over the last several decades, wave propagation in acoustic metamaterials has become a subject of a constantly growing interest in various aspects of modern physics and engineering sciences [1–9]. These special dynamical systems have driven considerable attention for their highly tunable, material properties (e.g., tailored band-gaps) which gave rise to some important acoustical properties such as sound focusing, sound absorption, enhanced spatial-temporal control over the deformation of sound fields, and more.
Since the pioneering work by Liu et_al [10], a new class of acoustic metamaterials, has been introduced and broadly considered in various experimental and theoretical studies of the past decade. These special types of dynamical systems are usually referred to in the literature as locally resonant metamaterials (LRSMs) and are characterized by the presence of the local resonating units periodically embedded in their internal structure. One of the advantages of these unique models is their ability to form the low-frequency band gaps. Here, we also note that these materials possess some additional, important acoustical properties such as a negative effective mass [11–15] and a negative refractive index [16,17] and have been extensively studied in some earlier as well as the relatively recent studies. It is important to note that the vast majority of these studies have been primarily concerned with the linearized acoustics of these structures. However, it is a well-known fact that presence of the nonlinearity in the acoustic structure may drastically change the overall response of the material, leading to some intriguing phenomena such as energy localization, uni-directional energy flow and broadband energy absorption [18], and unidirectional transport of discrete breathers [19].
Recently, this concept of locally resonant metamaterials (previously considered at the linear limit) has been extended to the weakly and highly nonlinear structures, such as granular crystals incorporating internal resonances. Several recent experimental and theoretical studies of these models [20–25] have reported the quite rich nonlinear phenomena. Among those studies, we would like to mention some of the very recent studies concerned with the wave propagation in the resonant granular chains [21–23], interaction of solitary waves with a local linear resonator incorporated in a granular crystal [24], emergence of traveling waves in the woodpile structures [25,26], formation of (stationary and moving) discrete breathers in resonant granular chains [27,28].
All these studiess have been primarily devoted to the study of nonlinear properties of the 1D locally resonant structures. However, to the best of authors' knowledge—little is known about the 2D nonstationary regimes emerging in the locally resonant acoustic metamaterials. In some very recent studies [29–31], the nonstationary regimes of the 2D, unit-cell model incorporating internal rotator has been addressed. These studies have succeeded the earlier studiess which have been focused on the theoretical and experimental studies of the targeted energy transfer in the 1D unit-cell models with internal rotators [32–34].
The nonstationary regimes are characterized by the intense energy flow between the several resonating fragments of the coupled mechanical systems. It is worth noting that in many real-life problems of applied physics and engineering (e.g., nonlinear vibration suppression in the externally loaded mechanical structures [18,35], strong plasma-wave excitation [36], auto-resonant control of nonlinear waves, and solitonic excitations in nonlinear dispersive media [37–39], energy transfer in a gravity wave spectrum [40–42] and resonant interactions of the random waves in a dispersive medium [43–45]) understanding of the complex nonlinear phenomena of highly nonstationary regimes turns out to be of a central importance.
Previous theoretical studies concerned with the emergence of highly nonstationary regimes such as the strongly modulated regime (SMR) [18,35,50–53], as well as the typical regimes of intense nonlinear beats [31,47–49], have shown that these regimes are qualitatively different from the stationary (NNMs) and weakly modulated regimes. Additionally as it is evident from these studies, these regimes possess their own bifurcation structure and in the general case can hardly be related to the bifurcations of the coexisting stationary regimes (NNMs). Therefore, understanding of these highly nonstationary processes requires the formulation of special approaches enabling their adequate description. One of the approaches was introduced by Gendelman et_al [51–53] In the same studies it was shown that the system comprising the harmonically excited linear oscillator with strongly nonlinear attachment (NES) may exhibit the quite unusual nonstationary regime which is referred to as SMR. This regime is manifested by the strong energy exchanges (in the vicinity of main resonance) between the primary oscillator and the NES characterized by the relaxation type motion exhibited by its envelope. To analyze the bifurcation of these regimes the special analytical approach (based on the slow-fast time scale separation) has been developed [51–53]. Recently, the concept of limiting phase trajectories (LPT) was introduced by Manevitch et_al [47–49] This approach enables an adequate analysis of the typical beating states characterized by the intense, resonant energy flow, emerging in the various, anharmonic, oscillatory models.
In the present study, we consider an oscillatory chain composed of the axially coupled elements. Each element of the chain is subject to the local, linear potential along the lateral direction and incorporates the lightweight internal rotator. It is important to emphasize that the 2D nonstationary regimes have been previously considered solely for the unit-cell models (see e.g., Refs [29–31]) incorporating the internal rotator. However, based on these recent studies some very important and natural questions arise. Can the concept of 2D energy transfer (energy channeling) emerging in the locally resonant unit-cell model be utilized for the spatial wave manipulation in locally resonant multi-cellular models? How the 2D nonstationary regimes of intense, resonant energy transfer manifest themselves in the many-body systems? Is it possible to describe and predict these regimes analytically? Does the translation from the unit-cell to the multi-cellular models affect the stability of these regimes? To the best of author's knowledge all these questions have not been considered in the previous studies and deserve a careful analytical and numerical investigation.
The main focus of the present work is on the analysis of the fundamental mechanisms governing the complex, resonant transitions between the longitudinal and the shear waves supported by the quasi one dimensional chain under consideration. Thus assuming the 1:1 resonance interaction between the longitudinal and the shear waves, we focus on the limit of the low energy regimes. To this end we apply the regular multi-scale procedure and derive the modulation equations (slow flow model). The derived slow flow model depicts the resonant (wave-wave) interaction of the longitudinal and the shear waves being inertially coupled through the internal rotatory field. Further analysis of the derived slow flow model reveals the two distinct types of highly nonstationary regimes, namely the regime of the bidirectional energy exchange between the shear and the longitudinal waves as well as the regimes of complete, irreversible, transformation from the longitudinal wave to a shear wave. The two distinct mechanisms of bi- and uni- directional two-dimensional energy flow between the two wave structures are analyzed in this study. Thus, the analysis of the first regime of a bi-directional energy channeling reveals the quite unusual mechanism concerning its formation and bifurcation structure. Thus, the bifurcation of this regime signifies the breakdown of the bidirectional resonant wave-wave interaction which results in the one directional wave entrapment. Further analysis of the dissipative slow-flow model unveils the mechanism of formation of the unidirectional, irreversible transformation of the longitudinal wave into the shear wave. In the present study we show that this regime is primarily governed by the initial tuning of the internal rotators. The results of the analysis presented in the study are found to be in a good agreement with those of the direct numerical simulations of the full model.
However, in contrast to the previous studies this work aims at addressing the following important questions, namely the manifestation of the energy channeling phenomena in the locally resonant, quasi one dimensional acoustic structures.
II. MODEL
In the present study, we consider a problem of the 2D resonant wave redirection (channeling) in an oscillatory chain composed of the axially coupled elements. Each element of the chain is subject to the local, linear potential along the lateral direction and incorporates the lightweight internal rotator. Scheme of the model under consideration is illustrated in Fig. 1.
For the model under consideration, we assume the following: (1) the motion of the system is in-plane, (2) gravity is not taken into account, and (3) linear, viscous dissipation is assumed for the internal rotator. It is easy to show that the underlying Hamiltonian system is defined by the following Lagrangian:
To account for the dissipation, we use a regular Rayleigh function
The governing equations of motion are easily derived from (1) and (2) using Lagrangian formalism
Here M stands for the mass of the outer element, m is the mass of the internal rotator, R is the radius of the internal rotatory path (see Fig. 1), k_{x},k_{y}-linear stiffness coefficients of the horizontal and vertical springs (attached to each outer element), respectively, x_{n},y_{n}—axial and lateral deflections of the outer mass element located at the n-th row, θ_{n}—angular deflection of the internal rotator (see Fig. 1), c—linear damping coefficient of the internal rotator. To bring System (3) into its nondimensional form, we perform a regular system rescaling
Introducing (4) into (3) one arrives at the nondimensional set of the governing equations of motion
The present model under consideration assumes the periodic boundary conditions for the longitudinal motion of the outer elements, which are formulated as follows:
where N stands for the number of cells included in the chain. In the present study, we focus on the mechanisms of resonant, transformations of the longitudinal wave into a shear wave emerging in the locally resonant, quasi 1D chain under consideration in the limit of low energy excitations.
It is worth noting that ε parameter, which according to (4) has the physical meaning of mass-ratio (i.e., ratio between the mass of the internal rotator and the total system mass), is formally declared as a small system parameter (0<ε≪1). As evident from (5)ε—scales the strength of the coupling between the internal rotator and the outer mass. In the present study, we focus on the analysis of the two peculiar non-stationary states.
Bidirectional wave channeling—corresponds to a complete, recurrent energy transitions between the longitudinal and the shear waves.
Unidirectional wave channeling—corresponds to the permanent, unidirectional transformation of the longitudinal wave into a shear wave.
In sections III and IV, we perform an extensive analytical and numerical study of the resonant mechanisms leading to the aforementioned phenomena of bidirectional and unidirectional wave channeling and their related global bifurcations. As will become clear from the further analysis, despite the complexity of the system under consideration these mechanisms of the (1:1) resonant interaction between the longitudinal and the shear waves can be fully described and predicted analytically.
III. THEORETICAL STUDY OF RESONANT WAVE CHANNELING MECHANISMS
In the present section, we pursue the extensive analytical and numerical studies of the intrinsic dynamics of (5) in the limit of low energy excitations. In Subsection III A we derive the modulation equations (in the low energy limit) depicting the resonant interaction of the longitudinal traveling waves with the shear waves, coupled through the internal rotators. Subsection III B is devoted to the analysis of the aforementioned wave channeling phenomena (i.e., bidirectional and unidirectional) emerging in the conservative as well as the dissipative cases. Special emphasis of Subsection III B is given to the analysis of nonstationary mechanisms giving rise to the formation of complete, 2D wave redirection in the locally resonant acoustic structure, under consideration.
A. Multi-scale analysis of 2D wave-wave interaction (1:1 resonance)
To describe analytically the mechanism of wave channeling as well as finding the necessary conditions for its existence in the locally resonant, quasi 1D chain under consideration we perform an effective reduction of the full system dynamics into a neighborhood of a 1:1 resonance manifold corresponding to the wave-wave (longitudinal–shear) interaction.
To analyze the dynamics of (5) in the limit of low energy excitations, we use the regular, multi-scale asymptotic expansion. In the present section, we do not bring all the details of the multi-scale procedure. An interested reader can find all the details of the derivation in the Appendix. It is worth noting that in the present study we are mainly interested in studying the resonant interaction between the longitudinal and shear traveling waves. Following the multi-scale procedure, the traveling wave solutions take the following form:
Here ξ_{n0},χ_{n0} stand for the leading order longitudinal and lateral response of the nth element in the chain. Additionally, the particular solution considered for the axial displacement (ξ_{n0}) consists of the superposition of the traveling wave solution and its slowly evolving offset (C(τ_{1},τ_{2},…)). In fact an offset of the traveling wave solution can only build up in the axial direction due to the periodic boundary conditions assumed in this direction. As for the lateral response of the outer elements, no offset of the shear wave solution is possible (in the lateral direction), as all the outer elements are attached to the rigid wall (see Fig. 1).
As we have mentioned above, in the present problem under consideration we are mainly interested in understanding the uni- and bi-directional mechanisms of wave channeling which are primarily governed by the resonance interaction between the longitudinal and the shear waves excited on the outer elements of the chain. To this end, we assume the 1:1 resonance relation between the axial and the shear waves. This requirement dictates the following resonance condition imposed on the lateral stiffness component:
where the frequency and the wave number of the longitudinal traveling wave are given by ω=2(1−cosq), q=2πñ/N, accordingly. Proceeding with the multi-scale expansion (the details of the derivation are brought in the Appendix A), we obtain the following system of the modulation equations:
where A(τ_{1},τ_{2},…),B(τ_{1},τ_{2},…) stand for the slow modulation of the longitudinal and shear traveling wave solutions while θ_{0}(τ_{1},τ_{2},…) stands for the slow modulation of the internal field of rotators. The derived slow-flow model depicts the (1:1) wave-wave interaction (i.e., resonant interaction between the longitudinal and the shear waves) excited on the outer elements of the chain. In fact, the considered (1:1) wave-wave interaction is realized through the dynamics of the internal rotatory field which effectively couples the two outer fields of the collective longitudinal and the shear wave motion.
The final part of the solution of the axial response which still remains unknown is a slow evolving offset C(τ_{1},…). The offset can be derived from the next order approximation of the multi-scale expansion. Thus, proceeding to the third order of the multi-scale expansion (the details of the derivation are shown in the Appendix) and eliminating the secular terms yields the condition on the slowly varying offset C(τ_{1},…) of the axial traveling wave
Solution of (10) yields
Further, assuming that the offset C(τ_{1},…) is a bounded function we set G(τ_{2},…) to zero. This gives us an explicit expression for the axial offset of the traveling wave solution
Using the derived slow-flow model (9), we analyze the mechanism of the resonant wave channeling for the conservative (μ=0) as well as the dissipative (μ>0) cases.
B. Analytical prediction of the wave channeling mechanism
In the present subsection, we derive the analytical predictions of the formation of different regimes which can be attributed to the 2D channeling phenomena. It can be easily shown that System (9) possesses the following conserved quantity:
As it has been shown in the numerous works (see e.g., Refs [47–49]), this conserved quantity can be used for the rather convenient coordinate transformation leading to an additional order reduction. Thus, the angular coordinates are introduced in the following form:
Substituting (14) into (9) and introducing the relative phase coordinate Δ=δ_{1}−δ_{2} yields the following reduced-order model:
In the present study, we are interested in the analysis of the two distinct nonstationary regimes, corresponding to the bi- and unidirectional wave channeling. A structure, somewhat similar to the slow-flow system given in (15) has been considered in a recent analysis of the 2D regimes emerging in a single-cell model [30,31]. Thus, for the sake of clarity of the present exposition, we briefly introduce the main results concerning the nonstationary regimes of (15). We present the analysis of mechanisms of bi- and unidirectional wave channeling corresponding to conservative and dissipative cases, respectively. Thus, in Subsection III B 1 we present a nonstationary analysis of the regime of a bidirectional wave channeling and its bifurcation structure corresponding to the conservative case (μ=0). In Subsection III B 2 we discuss the second nonstationary mechanism of a unidirectional, dissipative (μ>0), irreversible wave transformation from the longitudinal to shear wave.
1. Conservative case – bidirectional wave channeling
The underlying conservative system of (15) reads
In fact, system (16) possesses the following conserved quantities:
As will be shown below, for some special choice of the system parameters one can fully describe the main features of the global system dynamics and construct the relatively simple analytical predictions of the formation and bifurcations of highly nonstationary regimes. Using the first conserved quantity of (17) the four-dimensional slow flow model (16) can be further reduced to the three-dimensional phase space, yielding
Next, we show that for a certain choice of the system parameters one can completely describe and predict analytically the emergence of the intriguing phenomenon of “bidirectional wave channeling.” To demonstrate the emergence of this special nonstationary regime, we resort again to the analysis of the slow-flow model (18) setting (L=0). The system under consideration, reads
It is easy to see that System (19) possesses an additional conserved quantity G, given by
where
In fact (20) defines a projection of the entire phase space of (19) onto the (θ_{0},Θ) plane. In Fig. 2 we show the projections of the full phase space of (19) corresponding to the four distinct values of Ñ. Understanding of the mechanism of a bidirectional wave channeling requires the definition of the two basic localized states. The first localized state corresponds to a complete energy localization on the longitudinal wave (Θ≡0) while the second state corresponds to a complete energy localization on the shear wave (Θ≡π/2). As is clear from the results shown in Fig. 2, there exist three types of projected trajectories namely, returning trajectories which emanate from a certain localized state (e.g., Θ≡0 or Θ≡π/2) and return to the same state (without crossing the second one), channeling trajectories which connect both localized states [i.e., (Θ≡0) with (Θ≡π/2)] and finally the disconnecting trajectories which circulate between the two localized states without crossing any of them. In the upper left and the upper right panels of Fig. 2 one can note the special regions which contain solely the channeling trajectories. These are the special zones which will be referred to as the “channeling regions.” As is clear from the previous definitions, regime of a bi-directional wave channeling can exist solely in the channeling regions. Interestingly, these channeling regions gradually shrink with the increase of the value of Ñ and at a certain critical value of Ñ=Ñ{CR} [Fig. 2(c)] completely vanish through the global bifurcation. This global bifurcation of the channeling regions gives rise to the formation of the third type of the projected trajectories, namely the disconnecting trajectories. As it is shown in the Appendix B the threshold value of Ñ corresponding to the global bifurcation undergone by the “channeling regions” is Ñ{CR}=2^{−1/2}.
We conclude the present subsection with highlighting the main results concerning the regime of a bidirectional wave channeling:
(1) There exists a unique phase trajectory corresponding to the regime of a bi-directional wave channeling which is defined implicitly by the following nonlinear algebraic equation (the proof of this statement can be found in Appendix B):
(2) This special regime vanishes through the global bifurcation illustrated in Fig. 2(c) at a critical value of Ñ=Ñ{CR}=2^{−1/2} (see Appendix B). As is clear from the results brought above, the bifurcation of the regime of a bidirectional wave channeling brings about the spatial energy localization on the longitudinal traveling wave accompanied with the mild energy transport to the shear wave.
2. Dissipative case – unidirectional wave channeling
In the present subsection, we discuss an additional highly nonstationary mechanism emerging in the dissipative case which is referred to as a unidirectional wave channeling. We simplify the analysis of the dissipative flow further by exploiting some special property of L(τ_{1},τ_{2},…). To this end we rewrite the expression for L(τ_{1},τ_{2},…) which turns out to be a time-dependent quantity in the dissipative case
Arguing similarly to Ref [30] one can show that the quantity L(τ_{1},τ_{2},…) satisfies the following important relation:
where E=L(0)+μθ_{0}(0). Thus accounting for (24) in (15) and performing some simple mathematical manipulations one arrives at the following reduced system:
Further, seeking for the stationary points of the reduced slow flow model (25) [i.e., stationary regimes of the full model (nonlinear normal modes – NNMs [46])] we equate all the time derivatives of the slow flow model to zero (∂Θ/∂τ_{1}=∂Δ/∂τ_{1}=∂θ_{0}/∂τ_{1}=0). This leads to the following set of nonlinear, algebraic equations:
It is easy to show that System (26) possesses the following set of fixed points:
Next we proceed with the linear stability analysis of the stationary points given in (27). To this end, we assume small variation in the vicinity of stationary points
where Δ_{S},θ_{0S},Θ_{S} stand for the stationary points, while δΘ̃,δΔ̃,δθ̃{0} stand for small variations in their neighborhood. Substituting (28) into (25) and performing a trivial linearization in the vicinity of the stationary points given by (27), one arrives at the following linear system:
The characteristic polynomial of the Jacobian matrix of (29), reads
Using the Routh–Hurwitz stability criterion it is easy to show that the fixed points given by (27) are stable for m even. In some recent studies of the similar slow-flow structure (see Ref [30] for the details), it has been demonstrated that only these stationary solutions can be related to the real NNMs of the full model (5). Interestingly enough, the stability of the different branches of the stationary points is independent of the fixed points θ_{0S} and Θ_{S} themselves.
In the rest of the present subsection, we focus on the analysis of the second nonstationary mechanism governing the aforementioned regime of complete, irreversible wave transformation (i.e., unidirectional wave channeling).
In what follows, we formulate the strategy of the optimal passive control of unidirectional wave transformation based on the tuning of internal rotators. As will become clear from further analysis, the internal rotators can be tuned in ways that can lead to various, intriguing dynamical states of partial as well as complete, unidirectional, and resonant wave transformation. To this end, we define initial state of the internal rotators as θ0I=θ_{0}(0) and the final state as θ0F=θ_{0}(τ_{1}→∞). Further, using the results of the stationary analysis (27) and the corresponding stability analysis, we formulate the following relations that map the initial states into the final stationary (stable) states:
where {Θ^{F},Δ^{F},θ0F} define the final (steady) state of the system. In fact, these analytical results of (31) can be further exploited for the initial tuning of the internal rotatory field to provide the partial or complete transformation of the longitudinal wave into the shear wave. Therefore, the final state of the system settles down at the required orientation where the external elements perform the unidirectional, periodic oscillations [at a certain orientation angle governed by the internal, initial rotator angle (θ0I), L(0), and dissipation (μ)]. In fact, these steady state regimes are manifested by the constant (steady) orientation of the internal rotators along the periodic wave motion of the outer elements.
To obtain the unique dynamical regime of a complete, unidirectional wave transformation from the longitudinal wave into the shear wave, let us consider the following initial state of the slow-flow model i.e., Δ^{I}=πn,θ0I=π/2−lμ^{−1},Θ^{I}=0,L(0)=l. Here we note that the values of Θ^{I} and Δ^{I} are assumed to be known and correspond to the initial excitation of the external elements in the form of the longitudinal traveling wave Θ^{I}=0 (the first localized state). To achieve a complete, irreversible, resonant transformation from the longitudinal to shear wave, one should require that Θ^{F}=π/2 (i.e., the second localized state). Inserting the required value of Θ^{F} into the last equation of (31) one arrives at the initial tuning of the internal rotatory field (θ0I=πμ/2−lμ) that assures the formation of the desired nonstationary regime of unidirectional wave channeling.
We conclude the results, of the Subsection III B 2 with emphasizing the flexibility of the obtained dissipative mechanism which enables the arbitrary, unidirectional, 2D energy flow from the longitudinal wave into the shear wave. Here, we also note the two limiting cases corresponding to the regime of a complete transformation of longitudinal wave into a shear wave as well as the opposing regime of complete one-directional energy localization on a single wave component (e.g., longitudinal wave). As is clear from the above results these regimes are fully controlled by the initial tuning of the internal rotatory devices. In Sec. IV, we confirm the results of the nonstationary analysis of both regimes (i.e., bidirectional and unidirectional) of wave channeling with the numerical simulations of the full models.
IV. NUMERICAL VERIFICATIONS
In the present section, we perform numerical verifications of the nonlinear analysis of nonstationary regimes developed in section III. In fact, the comparison method of the numerical and analytical models performed in the present section deserves some additional elaboration. As evident from the discussion in section III, the longitudinal traveling wave can develop a slowly evolving offset (drift of the response evolving in the super-slow time-scale τ_{2}) along with the 2D channeling process. This offset is formed due to the periodic boundary conditions. As shown in the above analysis and confirmed by the numerical simulations discussed below, formation of this slowly evolving offset does not affect the resonant mechanisms of the 2D wave channeling. Therefore, comparison of analytical and numerical models is performed only for the oscillatory part of the response excluding the slowly evolving drift of the longitudinal component of the response. To this end, the analytically derived offset C(τ_{1},τ_{2},…) is being subtracted from the actual longitudinal response of the full model (ξ̃{n}(t)=ξ_{n}(t)−C(t)). It is worth noting that the considered mechanisms of bi- and unidirectional wave channeling evolve in the slow time scale (τ_{1}), additionally at the initial state no offset is present in the longitudinal excitation (C(0)=0). Therefore, over the time scale within which the wave channeling phenomenon occurs one can assume D(τ_{2},τ_{3},…)≈D(0). Consequently, C(τ_{1},τ_{2},…) can be approximated as follows:
A. Initial tuning of the internal rotators
Additional important point which requires clarification concerns the initial tuning of the internal rotators. In fact, as is clear in section III at the leading order approximation the derived slow flow model (15) dictates the uniform deflection of all the rotators, i.e., θ_{0n}=θ_{0},ddτ_{1}θ_{0n}=ddτ_{1}θ_{0},1≤n≤N. However, in considering the initial conditions of the full system (5) one also needs to take into account the effect of the higher order terms [up to O(ε)]. To this end in all the numerical simulations of the present section the initial conditions are considered in the following form:
Here we note that the initial velocity field of the rotators dictated by the regular multi-scale procedure is slightly mismatched from the uniform deflection considered in the leading order approximation. As is clear from the initial conditions formulated in (33), this mismatch is an O(ε) small and is governed by the higher order terms (i.e., θ_{1n}) in the expansion. Additionally, the derived, leading order of the slow flow model does not take into consideration the higher order (O(ε)) terms in the response of the rotators which oscillate around the uniform rotational field θ_{0}(τ) governed by the slow-flow model. Therefore, the derived slow flow model approximates the averaged response of the rotators θ_{0}(τ). As will become clear from the numerical results of this section, these fluctuations around a mean value can be a cause of the slowly developing instability of the regimes of bidirectional wave channeling.
B. Numerical verifications of stationary regimes as well as the bi-directional wave channeling in the conservative case
In Fig. 3, we illustrate the time histories of the longitudinal (upper panel), transverse (middle panel) response of the 1st, 16th, 31st, and 46th outer elements of the chain as well as the response of the 1st, 16th, 31st, and 46th internal rotators (lower panel) corresponding to a simple stationary periodic motion (NNM) exhibited by the full model (5). The results of numerical simulations are compared with the predictions of stationary analysis of the slow-flow model (27). As is clear from the results of Fig. 3, the analytical prediction of the stationary response derived from the slow flow model predicts fairly well the response of the original model and above all, the correspondence of analytical and numerical models is fairly good. This stationary energy distribution between the longitudinal and the shear components of the response is illustrated in the space-time diagram of Fig. 4. In the left and the right panels of Fig. 4, we plot the density distribution of the kinetic energy (per a single element of the chain) along the chain corresponding to the longitudinal (left panel) and the shear (right panel) traveling waves propagating along the outer elements of the chain, respectively.
To verify the occurrence of the regimes of complete as well as the incomplete bi-directional wave channeling emerging in the conservative case we performed the two additional numerical simulations. To this end we apply an initial excitation on the chain in the form of the longitudinal traveling wave for the two distinct cases, namely Ñ<Ñ{CR}=2^{−1/2}, as well as Ñ>Ñ{CR}=2^{−1/2}.
In Fig. 5 (left panels), we plot again the time histories of the longitudinal (a), transverse (b), and response of the 1st, 16th, 31st, and 46th outer elements of the chain as well as the response of the 1st, 16th, 31st, and 46th internal rotators (c) corresponding to the regime of a complete bidirectional wave channeling predicted for the case of (Ñ<Ñ{CR}=2^{−1/2}). The regimes of the complete, bidirectional wave channeling predicted by the asymptotical model (19) are compared with these of the full system (5) (Fig. 5, left panels). As is clear from the results of (Fig. 5, left panels), the agreement between the analytical and numerical models is fairly good.
The time histories corresponding to the regimes of mild energy transport between the longitudinal and shear traveling waves predicted by the analytical model (i.e., spontaneous annihilation of the “channeling regions” for the case of Ñ>Ñ{CR}=2^{−1/2}) is illustrated in (Fig. 5, right panels). The results of numerical simulations presented in Fig. 5 confirm the analytically predicted global bifurcation of the response regime of a complete bidirectional wave channeling leading to the unidirectional (longitudinal) wave locking accompanied with mild energy flow between the longitudinal and the shear waves propagating along the outer elements of the chain (Fig. 5, right panels).
To better illustrate the bi-directional wave channeling phenomenon we constructed the space-time diagrams (Fig. 6). In the left and the right panels of Fig. 6, we plot the density distribution of the kinetic energy (per a single element of the chain) along the chain corresponding to the longitudinal (left panel) and the transverse (right panel) traveling waves, accordingly.
As one may infer from the results of the long-time numerical simulations shown in Fig. 5 (left and right panels) that the regimes of complete bi-directional wave channeling as well as this of the unidirectional wave entrapment appear to be unstable. Therefore, after a sufficiently long period containing the finite number of cycles of the (mild and complete) recurrent energy exchanges between the longitudinal and the shear waves the collective behavior of the internal rotators predicted by the leading order approximation of the multi-scale analysis is destroyed by the higher order terms, (i.e., low-amplitude non-synchronous oscillations exhibited by the rotators which have not been taken into account in the considered order of approximation). The gradual deviation of the response from the regimes of the (complete/incomplete) bidirectional wave channeling becomes evident after sufficiently long period [i.e., τ>9000timeunits, see Fig. 5 (left and right panels)]. Despite the instability, one can still observe the predicted regimes of bidirectional complete wave channeling and unidirectional wave locking. Evidently enough, both nonstationary regimes are long-lived.
C. Numerical verifications of the mechanism of partial and complete unidirectional wave channeling (dissipative case)
To verify the occurrence of the dissipative mechanism of complete and incomplete irreversible transformations between longitudinal and shear waves (i.e., partial and complete unidirectional wave channeling) we performed the two additional numerical simulations. Thus applying the similar initial excitation in the form of a periodic longitudinal, traveling wave on the outer elements of the chain we study numerically the true response of the chain for two distinct orientations of the internal rotatory field. In Fig. 7, we plot again the time histories of longitudinal (a), transverse (b), and responses of the 1st, 16th, 31st, and 46th outer elements of the chain as well as the response of the 1st, 16th, 31st, and 46th internal rotators (c) corresponding to the regime of a complete (upper panel) and partial (bottom panel) bidirectional wave channeling.
The comparison of the time histories of the response of traveling waves corresponding to the true dissipative system response (5) with these derived from the reduced, slow flow model (25) is illustrated for both regimes of Fig. 7. The tuning of the internal rotatory field has been performed in accordance with the analytical predictions presented in section III. As is clear from the results of Fig. 7, the derived slow-flow model depicts fairly well the response of the full model and above all, emergence of both phenomena of complete as well as partial energy channeling discussed in section III are in agreement with the theoretical predictions based on the analysis of the reduced order model (25).
Additional illustration of the mechanism of uni-directional, complete wave channeling phenomenon is performed via time-space diagrams (see Fig. 8). In the left and the right panels of Fig. 8, we plot the kinetic energy distribution along the outer elements of the chain corresponding to longitudinal and shear traveling waves, accordingly.
To showcase the mechanism of irreversible wave transformation, we added additional space-time diagrams corresponding to the zoomed initial region (Fig. 9) and zoomed final [steady state regions (Fig. 10)]. The zoomed areas shown in Figs. 9 and 10 corresponding to the initial and the final stages of the irreversible wave transformation illustrated on the full space-time diagram of Fig. 8 are denoted with bold red dashed lines.
As one may infer from the results of Fig. 8, unlike the previous results concerning the bi-directional wave channeling, the regime of complete unidirectional wave channeling appears to be stable. We conjecture that the stability of this nonstationary regime is gained because of the presence of dissipative term in the system which suppresses the effect of higher order terms neglected in the leading order approximation (25).
In summary, we would like to stress once again that the results of Figs. 7, 8, 9, and 10 fully confirm the analytical predictions of the mechanism for both partial and complete, unidirectional wave channeling. Moreover, we confirmed numerically that at the final (steady) state energy distribution between the longitudinal and the transverse traveling waves of the outer elements is fully controlled by the initial state of the internal rotatory field.
V. CONCLUSIONS
In the present work we considered the special, nonstationary regimes of two-dimensional, (bidirectional and unidirectional) energy channeling between the longitudinal and the shear waves emerging in the locally resonant, acoustic structure. To this end we considered an oscillatory chain of the axially coupled elements where each element of the chain is subject to the local linear potential along the lateral direction and incorporates the lightweight internal rotator. Using the regular multi-scale analysis in the limit of low energy regimes, we described analytically the special resonant mechanisms governing the complete bi- and unidirectional transitions between the longitudinal and the shear waves coupled through the internal rotatory field. These regimes are manifested by the two-dimensional energy flow between the longitudinal and the shear waves which can occur in the recurrent as well as the irreversible fashion. In this study, we have shown that the spatial control of the two dimensional energy flow between the longitudinal and the transverse waves is solely governed by the internal orientation of the coupled rotatory field.
Nonlinear analysis of the regimes of a bidirectional energy channeling, unveils their global bifurcation structure. Analysis of the reduced slow-flow model corresponding to 1:1 resonant wave-wave interaction between longitudinal and transverse waves we was able to predict analytically the thresholds of their spontaneous transitions from a complete bidirectional wave-wave channeling to the uni-directional entrapment. The second regime of a complete, irreversible transformation of longitudinal wave into a shear wave has been analyzed. Using the conserved quantities of the underlying Hamiltonian system, we effectively reduce the dissipative flow from the four dimensional to the three dimensional phase space. Further analysis of the reduced flow yields the explicit analytical prediction of the initial orientation of the internal rotatory field resulting in the complete irreversible transformation of the longitudinal wave into the shear wave.
Long time numerical simulations of the full model unveil the instability of the nonstationary regime of the bidirectional wave channeling. As explained in the paper, these instabilities are governed by the higher order terms which have been omitted in the multi-scale analysis. Though the instability, these nonstationary processes of the bidirectional energy channeling exhibited by the conservative system can be attributed to the long lived regimes. As it is clear from the results of additional numerical simulations of the dissipative system, the second nonstationary regime corresponding to the unidirectional wave transformation from the longitudinal to shear wave appears to be stable. Stability of these nonstationary regimes has been verified by the long time numerical simulations of the full model. It is worth noting that the results of the analysis of both mechanisms are found to be in a fairly good agreement with these of the numerical simulations of the full model.
The authors believe that the results of the present work lead to the quite interesting future studies of wave reorientation in the more complex systems such as the locally resonant metamaterials with the square/hexagonal lattice structure incorporating internal rotators. Thus using the nonlinear analysis developed in the present work one will be able to reveal and predict the quite reach scenarios of the resonant wave transformations emerging in the complex 2D structures. These will include the recurrent and irreversible transformations of longitudinal traveling (or standing) waves to their transversal counterparts. Another interesting extension which can be made in this regard is the analysis of similar phenomena of bi-directional wave channeling and unidirectional wave localization in the limit of high energy excitations.
APPENDIX A: MULTI-SCALE ANALYSIS
The formal multi-scale expansion is considered in the following form:
Introducing (A1) into (5) and expanding with respect to the like powers of ε leads, in the zeroth order (O(ε^{0})), to the following results:
Zeroth order, O(ε^{0})
Solution of (A2) reads
Apparently, angular motion of the rotator given in (A3) is a rapidly growing, linear function. However, in scope of the present analysis we are seeking for the slow modulation equation depicting the slow evolution of the amplitudes and phases. To this end, we set A_{n1}(τ_{1},…) to be an identically zero function (A_{n}(τ_{1},…)≡0). Therefore, in this asymptotic limit θ_{n0} is a slowly varying function.
Proceeding with a multi-scale expansion to the first order (O(ε^{1})) and accounting for (A4), we obtain
First order, O(ε)
It is worth noting that in the present study we are mainly interested in the resonant interaction of the axial traveling wave with the lateral one. To this end, we consider the following particular solution of the first two equations of (A5):
where A(τ_{1},…) and B(τ_{1},…) are complex functions. The particular solution considered for the axial displacement (ξ_{n0}) consists of the superposition of the traveling wave solution and its slowly evolving offset. In fact, an offset of the traveling wave solution can only build up in the axial direction due to the periodic boundary conditions assumed in this direction. As for the lateral response of the outer elements, no offset of the shear wave solution is possible in that (lateral) direction as all the outer elements are attached to the rigid wall (see Fig. 1). Using (A4) and (A6), we integrate the third equation of (A5), which yields the following explicit expression for the first order term in the expansion of the angular coordinate (θ_{n1}(τ_{0},τ_{1},…)):
As we have mentioned above, in the present problem under consideration we are mainly interested in understanding the uni- and bi- directional mechanisms of wave channeling which are primarily governed by the resonance interaction between the axial and the lateral waves excited on the outer elements of the chain. To this end, we assume the 1:1 resonance interaction between the axial and the lateral waves. This requirement dictates the following resonance condition imposed on the lateral stiffness component:
where the frequency and the wave number of the longitudinal traveling wave are given by ω=2(1−cosq), q=2πñ/N, accordingly. The second order of the multi-scale expansion yields
Second order, O(ε^{2})
Removing the secular terms in (A9), yields
where A(τ_{1},…) stands for the slow modulation of the axial traveling wave solution while B(τ_{1},…) stands for the slow modulation of the lateral traveling wave solution.
As we mentioned above, Eq. (A10) depicts the interaction of the axial traveling wave with the lateral one coupled through the internal field of rotators. Thus, to maintain the consistent structure of (A10) one needs to assume (in the leading order) the uniform, internal, rotational field, i.e.,
The final part of the solution of the axial response which still remains unknown is a slow evolving offset C(τ_{1},…). The offset can be derived from the next order approximation of the multi-scale expansion of the axial components (ξ_{n}).The third order of the expansion reads
Third order, O(ε^{3})
Eliminating the secular term corresponding to the zero-frequency mode, yields the following condition on the slowly varying offset C(τ_{1},…) of the axial traveling wave:
It is easy to see that (A13) can be written in a more compact form
Further, assuming the offset C(τ_{1},…) to be a bounded function gives us an explicit expression for the axial offset of the traveling wave solution
APPENDIX B: ANALYTICAL STUDY OF CHANNELING REGIONS
To find the threshold value of Ñ=Ñ{CR} corresponding to the global bifurcation undergone by the “channeling regions” we use the conserved quantity given by (20) and define
Here, θ0± stands for the values of the rotator angle corresponding to the first and the second localized states. Thus for the first and the second states, (20) reads
Each channeling trajectory satisfies the following relation:
Using (B3) in (B2) yields the very important relations
The critical value of Ñ=Ñ{CR} can be easily derived from the solvability conditions of the second equation of (B4) yielding
It is worth noting that the existence of the “channeling regions” does not necessarily mean that each projected trajectory belonging to this region corresponds to the regime of the bidirectional wave channeling. Indeed, one can easily realize a situation where the phase trajectory of the full slow flow model (19) (emanating from the localized state) which initially follows one of the projected, channeling paths [shown in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b)] suddenly turns back before it reaches the second state. Therefore, in order to find the unique regime of a complete bidirectional wave channeling we seek for the trajectories of the entire phase space which recurrently interconnects both localized states. To this end we use the second integral of motion given in (17). Arguing exactly as above we compute the values of Hamiltonian for both localized states
Obviously, each phase trajectory corresponding to the complete wave channeling must satisfy
Further, using (B7) in the first equation of (B4) we find out the unique trajectory which exists inside the “channeling region” and satisfies (G=0). This special trajectory which defines the regime of a bidirectional, complete energy channeling between the longitudinal and the shear waves is denoted with the red bold curve in the diagrams of Fig. 2.
