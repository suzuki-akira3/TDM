Effect of finger geometries on strain response of interdigitated capacitor based soft strain sensors
The finger geometry of embedded elastomeric comb capacitors significantly affects the electromechanical response of interdigitated capacitor (IDC) based soft sensors. When strain is applied to these IDC based soft sensors, the embedded soft combs are deformed, changing the sensor's capacitance to detect a variety of different mechanical loads. To better understand the effect of design parameters on sensor sensitivity, a comprehensive closed-form analytical model using geometric stretch and a parallel plate capacitance model in combination with a coplanar waveguide model to predict the strain response as a function of finger geometry and load orientation were developed. To validate this model, we compare the predicted response with computational and experimental methods using sensors with a combination of two different finger thicknesses and widths in a 4 mm^{2} area. Strong agreement was shown in all three results from the analytical model, the finite element analysis simulations, and the experiments validating that the sensitivity of IDC soft strain sensors can be tuned by finger geometry.
Interest in soft-matter transducers has grown in traditional and soft robotics because of their ability to be highly deformable while retaining electrical functionality. For example, soft sensors composed of a thin film of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) with embedded deformable conductors, such as conductive PDMS (cPDMS) [1,2] or conductive liquids [3,4], can detect mechanical stimuli under large deformation. In these sensors, the deformation of embedded soft structures induced by external mechanical stimuli leads to a change in their passive electrical properties, such as resistance and capacitance. Taking advantage of this change, soft sensors are capable of measuring different deformation modes such as shear [5,6], compression [7,8], or tension [9,10], although the fundamental measurement for each of these is often strain. In the case of capacitive strain sensing, the capacitance change of interdigitated capacitor (IDC) based soft sensors can be directly mapped to an applied strain [10]. IDC based soft sensors have the advantage of large capacitance in a small areal footprint.
Many soft or flexible capacitive sensors use either a simple parallel plate model to describe capacitance [11,12] or only fringing fields [13]. However, IDC based soft sensors have capacitance contributions from both parallel and fringing fields. To maximize the sensitivity of an IDC based soft sensor, it is important to understand the effects and tradeoffs of sensor design parameters [Fig. 1(a)] on each of these capacitances. Overall, the strain response of the sensors depends on their initial capacitance; the higher initial capacitance the sensors have, the higher sensitivity the sensors can achieve [10,11]. When the areal footprint of the sensor is fixed, the initial capacitance from parallel fields is determined by the undeformed thickness t_{0}, gap g_{0} between adjacent electrodes, and number of fingers n. Initial capacitance from fringing fields depends on undeformed comb electrode width w_{0}, g_{0}, and n. Manufacturing limitations typically determine the minimum size of g_{0}, and the number of fingers n is defined by w_{0} assuming a fixed area. Therefore, t_{0} and w_{0} are the defining parameters for determining capacitance from parallel and fringing fields, respectively.
In this paper, we evaluate the influence of embedded elastomeric IDC geometry on the resulting sensitivity of the IDC based soft strain sensors by developing a comprehensive analytical model and comparing that with finite element analysis (FEA) and experiments. Embedded IDC sensors with four different geometries were constructed in an areal footprint of 4 mm^{2} and loaded with strain (ε) from 0 to 0.5 in two different directions. In order to account for capacitance from both parallel and fringing fields, a closed-form analytical model was derived by correlating the elastic deformation of the sensor structures with a parallel plate capacitance model and a coplanar waveguide model. Three dimensional (3D) multiphysics FEA simulations were performed to confirm the analytically predicted sensors' response to the applied strain. The predictions from both the analytical model and the FEA simulation showed clear agreement with the experimental measurements, demonstrating that design and fabrication choices for IDC geometry can have a significant influence on the strain response of the IDC.
Figure 1(a) shows the basic sensor architecture with its undeformed geometry: comb electrode thickness t_{0}, width w_{0}, and length L_{0}, gap g_{0} between neighboring electrodes, and thickness of both the embedded IDC and surrounding dielectric film h_{0}. Two different loading conditions, lateral combs (LCs) and transverse combs (TCs), were used for evaluating the sensor response (Fig. 2). The comb electrodes of the LC design are aligned parallel to the direction of strain. In contrast, the TC design employs electrodes orthogonal to the strain direction. Each sensor is composed of a thin PDMS (Slygard 184, Dow Corning) dielectric with embedded cPDMS (7 wt. % of multiwalled carbon nanotubes in PDMS having a 10:1 curing ratio) comb electrodes. More details on materials and fabrication are given in the supplementary material. IDCs with four different geometries (Table I) were constructed in the center of a relatively thick dielectric film (nominal h_{0} = 650 μm); the four geometries have the same g_{0} and L_{0} but combinations of two different w_{0} and t_{0}. Given w_{0}, n was determined: w_{0} = 100 μm or 200 μm results in n of 18 or 10, respectively. The dimensions of each geometry were measured using a commercial interferometer (TMS-1200 TopMap μ.Lab, Polytec) as shown in Fig. 1(c) and Fig. S2 in the supplementary material.
To derive the analytical model, the capacitance changes of the sensors were divided into parallel plate capacitance (C_{p}) from the comb electrodes' side walls [Fig. 2(a)] and fringing field capacitance (C_{f}) from the top and bottom surface of the electrodes [Fig. 2(b)]. The elastomeric dielectric film and embedded comb electrodes were regarded as elastically homogeneous and assumed to experience uniform stretch [λ_{x}, λ_{y}, λ_{z}, where λ_{x}λ_{y}λ_{z} = 1 and λ = (1 + ε)] along the three Cartesian axes as shown in Fig. 2(a). The geometric variables under stretch can be expressed as L = L_{0}λ_{x}, w = w_{0}λ_{z}, h = h_{0}λ_{y}, t = t_{0}λ_{y}, and g = g_{0}λ_{z}, where the subscript 0 indicates undeformed geometries.
The parallel plate capacitance C_{p} can be expressed as
where n is the number of fingers and ϵ_{0} and ϵ_{r} represent the vacuum and relative permittivity, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the applied uniaxial strain results in the two electrodes moving closer (LC) or further away (TC) from each other, leading to an increase and a decrease in capacitance, respectively.
Figure 2(b) shows fringing fields generated from the top and bottom surfaces of the comb electrodes. To simplify the model, the capacitance outside the dielectric and from finger tips is neglected. Compared to the dielectric layer, the air layers not only have low permittivity but are also far from the electrodes resulting in negligible capacitance contribution. In addition, the sensors' sufficiently long finger length results in a negligible effect of the finger tips [14]. A model for fringe capacitance was developed by Fassler and Majidi [13], but to capture the more complex geometry of IDCs, the remaining capacitance from fringing fields needs to be separated into the capacitance from external electrodes at the edges of the IDC (C_{f,e}) and internal electrodes (C_{f,i}). Like the C_{p} case, the deformations of each geometric variable are described in stretch. The following derivations of C_{f,e} and C_{f,i} are only valid for IDCs with n ≥ 4.
The external section can be regarded as an IDC with three fingers and two gaps. Using the formula for a three-strip coplanar waveguide [15],C_{f,e} is derived as
where K(k_{f,e}) and K(k′_{f,e}) are the complete elliptic integrals of the first kind with modulus k_{f,e} and the complementary modulus k′_{f,e}. These moduli are defined by
An expression for C_{f,i} can be derived using the formula describing the capacitance of a periodic structure [14]
where the moduli of the complete elliptic integrals are
By summing Eqs. (2) and (3), the total capacitance from fringing fields, C_{f}, can be calculated. Finally, the total capacitance of the sensor can be calculated by adding up all types of capacitance from the electrodes within the sensor: C_{total} = C_{p} + C_{f}.
The derived model is a function of geometric variables, t_{0}, w_{0}, L_{0}, h_{0}, g_{0}, n, and λ in each Cartesian direction. To determine the most important design variables, some assumptions are made: L_{0} and h_{0} are determined by sensor size and thickness specifications, and the minimum g_{0} is determined by manufacturing limitations. From Eq. (1), C_{p} = f(t, L, g, n); with the above assumptions, C_{p} mainly depends on t_{0}. Likewise, C_{f} is highly dependent on w_{0} under the same assumptions because it is a function of w, L, g, and n. In both cases, n is a dependent variable which can be defined by w_{0}, g_{0}, and L_{0} in a given area. Hence, with these assumptions, C_{total} can be solely described by geometric variables, t_{0} and w_{0}.
3D multiphysics FEA simulations were implemented to confirm the theoretical model using a commercial FEA software package (ANSYS Mechanical APDL 16.1, ANSYS, Inc.). These uncoupled multiphysics simulations were conducted by the following procedure. Structures using SOLID185 elements were mechanically deformed, and then these elements were substituted with SOLID122 elements to prepare for an electromagnetic analysis. Finally, an electric potential (5 V) was applied across the electrodes and the capacitance was calculated by using electrostatic energy stored in the elements and the applied potential difference [16]. The SOLID185 elements used a three parameter Mooney-Rivlin model for PDMS (C_{10} = −0.6089, C_{01} = 1.0613, C_{11} = 0.5178, and d = 0.0006) and cPDMS (C_{10} = 0.3671, C_{01} = 0.4011, C_{11} = 0.3703, and d = 0.0004) [17].
Taking advantage of the symmetric boundary condition about the xz-plane [Fig. 2(c)], models with the four different geometries in Table I were constructed and cut into halves, leading to a significant reduction in simulation time. For the structural analysis, strain increments of 0.05 were applied in the appropriate direction (ε_{x} for LC and ε_{z} for TC) up to a maximum strain of 0.5 as shown in Fig. 2(c). For the electromagnetic analysis, the vacuum permittivity of 8.854 pF/m was used and a relative permittivity of 2.8 for PDMS [18] was assigned to the SOLID 122 elements. The same permittivity values were also used to obtain theoretical predictions.
Figure 3 shows the theoretical and FEA predictions of LC and TC sensors with all four different geometries. Mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) are used to quantitatively compare FEA simulation results to the proposed analytical model. MAPE is defined by
where M, A_{t}, F_{t}, and n are the MAPE value, the simulated FEA result at each applied strain, a predicted value at each applied strain according to the model, and the number of applied strains, respectively. The maximum MAPE for all sensor types was 6.3% (LC) and 8.6% (TC). When compared to maximum MAPEs of 31% (LC) and 17% (TC) using a model without fringe capacitance [10], the proposed model improved the MAPE by an average of 8.5 (LC) and 2.8 (TC), thereby confirming strong agreement between the proposed theoretical model and FEA simulations. Full MAPE results for each sensor type are included in the supplementary material.
Experimentally, three samples of each of the four TC and LC sensor geometries were tested by applying uniaxial strains from 0 to 0.5 using a motorized stage (PT3-Z8, ThorLab, Inc.). Each sensor sample was examined with three trials, and similar to the FEA, the load was increased in strain increments of 0.05. After each increment, the stage was paused for 1.5 s to stabilize the applied strain, and changes in capacitance were measured using a commercial evaluation board (EVAL-AD7745/6EB, Analog Devices) with a 16.1 Hz sampling rate. More details on the experimental setup and resulting measurement uncertainty are included in the supplementary material.
For the capacitance responses from each sample shown in Fig. 3, the standard deviation from the LC and TC sensors increases with the increase in applied strain. Given this trend and the fact that standard deviations across different trials of the same sensor were small, this uncertainty likely originates from different initial capacitances (and therefore sensitivities) in the three different sensors tested. These differences are primarily due to variations in the total fabricated thickness (580 μm–710 μm) and small variations in the finger thickness (85 ± 2 μm and 130 ± 1 μm) across sensor samples. The largest standard deviations were 0.02 pF for both LC and TC sensors at the smallest applied strain of 0.05 and 0.22 pF (LC) and 0.19 pF (TC) at a maximum applied strain of 0.5.
MAPEs were also calculated for experimental results; for each sensor type, A_{t} in Eq. (4) was represented by the mean change in capacitance measured at each applied strain across all 9 trials. MAPEs from experimental results were less than 6.2% (LC) and 6.3% (TC). The proposed model improved MAPEs by an average of 4.8 and 2.1 times for LC and TC sensors, respectively, when compared to previous models without fringe capacitance with MAPEs of 23% (LC) and 14% (TC) [10]. Once again, these experimental results validate improved predictions from the proposed model.
The close agreement between the analytical model and experimental results in Fig. 3 demonstrates that this comprehensive analytical model (including C_{f}, C_{p}, and λ) greatly improves upon the simple model for soft IDCs used in previous work [10]. Across both FEA and experimental results, the proposed model improved MAPEs by an average of 6.6 and 2.5 times for LC and TC sensors, respectively, when compared to previous models without fringe capacitance. It should be noted that the improved modeling of TC sensors was not as significant as the improved modeling of LC sensors due to ΔC_{p}'s increased fraction of ΔC_{total} for TC sensors. However, the model still provides significantly improved insight into sensor design for both loading conditions.
Figure 3 shows the resulting linearity from both loading conditions. The strain response of LC sensors shows high linearity in contrast to TC sensors that are less linear and show a decrease in linearity along with sensitivity. Considering Eq. (1), λ_{y} and λ_{z} cancel, resulting in a C_{p} proportional to λ_{x}. However, C_{p} of the TC sensor is proportional to 1/λz2 because λ_{x} is multiplied by λ_{y} becoming 1/λ_{z}. In addition, C_{p}'s fraction of C_{total} is constant regardless of loading conditions for LC sensors. However, for the TC sensor, C_{p}'s fraction of C_{total} continuously decreases along with the increase in the applied strain as shown in Fig. S4. This provides both insights as to why the response of sensors with LC loading is linear and the reduced improvement for TC sensors when compared to LC sensors with the new model. More discussion on C_{p}'s fraction of C_{total} is included in the supplementary material.
The significant effect of comb electrode geometry on the strain response of the sensors is shown in Fig. 4. A linear fitting across the full strain range (ΔC = Sε where S is the sensitivity) was employed to obtain the sensitivity of the sensors. Given four different geometries, the sensitivity of LC sensors, evaluated from the experimental results, was from 2.4 pF (LC3) to 5.5 pF (LC2) and that of TC sensors was from 2.3 pF (TC3) to 6.3 pF (TC2). Figure 4 also shows the level of theoretically predicted sensitivity regarding comb electrode geometry in terms of w_{0} and t_{0}. In both sensor cases, an increase in the sensitivity is expected as t_{0} increases or w_{0} decreases. When w_{0} is fixed (which may also result from a manufacturing constraint), higher t_{0} leads to an increase in C_{p}, resulting in higher sensitivity. In the case of fixed t_{0}, a decrease in w_{0} results in a sensitivity increase because smaller w_{0} leads to higher n in a fixed sensor area. Compared to t_{0}, w_{0} has a greater influence on the sensors' sensitivity because t_{0} solely contributes to C_{p}, but w_{0} influences both C_{p} and C_{f}. For example, the sensors with geometry 1 have a higher sensitivity than those with geometry 4 even though geometry 4 has the higher t_{0}.
The main contribution of this work is to characterize the effect of embedded comb capacitors' finger geometry on the sensitivity of IDC based soft sensors. The results from the theoretical model, FEA simulation, and experiments demonstrate that the strain response of the sensors can be tuned by modifying the comb electrode finger width and thickness. In addition, the closed-form analytical solution can be used to characterize other types of IDC based soft sensors, as well as for optimizing sensor geometry given manufacturing and area constraints. Future efforts will be concentrated on developing and optimizing new soft capacitive sensor architectures allowing sensors to have an improved linear response with high sensitivity in smaller areas.
