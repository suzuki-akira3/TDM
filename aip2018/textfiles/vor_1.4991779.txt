Theories of quantum dissipation and nonlinear coupling bath descriptors
The quest of an exact and nonperturbative treatment of quantum dissipation in nonlinear coupling environments remains in general an intractable task. In this work, we address the key issues toward the solutions to the lowest nonlinear environment, a harmonic bath coupled both linearly and quadratically with an arbitrary system. To determine the bath coupling descriptors, we propose a physical mapping scheme, together with the prescription reference invariance requirement. We then adopt a recently developed dissipaton equation of motion theory [R. X. Xu et_al, Chin. J. Chem. Phys. 30, 395 (2017)], with the underlying statistical quasi-particle (“dissipaton”) algebra being extended to the quadratic bath coupling. We report the numerical results on a two-level system dynamics and absorption and emission line shapes.
I. INTRODUCTION
Quantum dissipation plays crucial roles in many fields of modern science. Various methods have been constructed since 1950s, with the focus on the reduced dynamics of central systems, under the influence of bath environments. Exact theories include the Feynman–Vernon influence functional path integral method [1–3] and its differential equivalence, the hierarchical-equations-of-motion formalism [4–11]. However, these theories exploit the Gaussian–Wick’s thermodynamical statistics [2,3], which is strictly valid only for linear bath couplings. Intrinsically, a linear bath coupling implies a weak backaction of system on environment. The lowest non-Gaussian–Wick’s environment influence requires a quadratic bath coupling. The quest here is closely related to the vibronic optical lineshape and rate problems [12–16], beyond the linear response theory [17–19]. The interest here is also closely related to the recent efforts toward quantum computing devices, where the fluctuations of linear noise could be effectively suppressed at optimal operational situations [20–24]. The quadratic noise fluctuations would then become the dominant source of decoherence.
There are two issues on the quantum dissipation theories with quadratic coupling environments. One is related to the fact that a non-Gaussian–Wick’s environment cannot be completely characterized with linear bath correlation functions. Actually the existence of nonlinear bath couplings would also alter the appearance of linear coupling descriptors [25]. The characterizations should be physically well supported. In our previous work [25], we considered a nonlinear solvation model, which however did not preserve the prescription reference invariance properties. We will revisit this issue and propose a proper mapping scheme, together with the aforementioned invariance requirement. The new bath coupling descriptors preserve the given total composite Hamiltonian with different system-and-bath decompositions. Another issue is concerned with the construction of a proper quantum dissipation theory such that the evaluated observable dynamic quantities also preserve the bath reference invariance. Various methods have been proposed, such as the time-dependent variational approaches with Davydov ansatz [12,26,27] and the stochastic methods [28–30].
In this work, we adopt the dissipaton-equation-of-motion (DEOM) approach [31,32]. This is a statistical quasi-particle theory for the dynamical influence of environment that can be either bosonic or fermionic or hard-core bosonic. DEOM describes explicitly not only the reduced system but also the hybrid bath dynamics, which could be measured experimentally, such as the Fano interference [33–35], Herzberg–Teller vibronic coupling dynamics [36], and transport current noise spectrum [37]. The extended DEOM theory [25] will be presented in Sec. II, where the environment assumes to be a linear-plus-quadratic coupling bath. From the construction point of view, the extended theory applies the well-established linear dissipaton algebra [31,32] to the evaluation of dissipaton-pair actions. We will elaborate in due course which would resemble an Ehrenfest mean-field type of treatment on quadratic bath couplings.
The main theoretical development of this work will be presented in Sec. III. It is concerned with the nonlinear coupling bath descriptors. To that end, we propose a linear-displacement-mapping (LDM) scheme, together with the reference-bath invariance requirement. It is noticed that the quadratic coupling strength does influence the linear descriptor, but not the other way around. We report the numerical demonstrations in Sec. IV. Indeed, the extended DEOM evaluations on dynamical observables exhibit the required reference-bath invariance properties. Finally, we conclude this paper in Sec. V.
II. DYNAMICAL DISSIPATON THEORY
A. The dissipaton equation of motion theory
In this section, we review the DEOM approach to the quantum dissipative dynamics in the presence of quadratic bath coupling [25,31,32]. Without loss of generality, we illustrate the theory for a single dissipative mode case, in which the total system-and-bath composite Hamiltonian of the form
The system Hamiltonian H_{0} and dissipative operator Q^{S} are arbitrary. The bath Hamiltonian and solvation coordinate assume
The solvation coordinate x^{B} is a macroscopic bath operator and set to be dimensionless, as well as Q^{S}. The α-parameters, which will be determined in Sec. III via a physical model, are then of energy unit. Throughout this paper, we set ℏ = 1 and β = 1/(k_{B}T), with k_{B} and T being the Boltzmann constant and temperature, respectively. Set also t ≥ 0 for the time variable.
It is well known that in the absence of nonlinear bath coupling (α_{2} = 0), the influence of harmonic environment follows the Gaussian statistics. In other words, the linear bath influence is completely dictated with the Gaussian–Wick’s thermodynamical quantities that are all related via the linear response theory [2,3]. In particular, one starts with the bath spectral density
It is expressed in terms of χB(−)(ω)≡Imχ_{B}(ω), with [3,38]
Here, [·, ·] denotes a commutator, x^{B}(t)≡e^{ihBt}x^{B}e^{−ihBt}, and ⟨Ô⟩{B}≡tr_{B}(Ôe^{−βhB})/tr_{B}e^{−βhB}. We have then
This is the fluctuation-dissipation theorem [3,38].
As H_{T} of Eq. (1) involves a quadratic x^B2-coupling, the influence of the harmonic bath is not solely characterized with the linear correlation function ⟨x^B(t)x^B(0)⟩{B}. Additional information will be needed. We will address this issue in Sec. III, together with the α-parameters that are to be determined with a physical model. Nevertheless, the dynamical influence of the x^B2-coupling could be well treated with the dissipaton algebra, in particular the non-Gaussian or generalized Wick’s theorem [25,31,32].
The DEOM theory starts with describing the influence of environment with a finite number of statistically independent quasi-particles, the dissipatons [31,32]. No matter whether there are nonlinear bath coupling or not, dissipatons are defined via the linear bath x^{B}-coupling part only. The effects of nonlinear bath coupling will be taken into account via the generalized (non-Gaussian) Wick’s theorem to be detailed later [cf. Eqs. (21)–(23)].
To proceed, we expand Eq. (5) in an exponential series [38–40],
We express its time reversal in the form of [9,38]
with k¯ being defined via γ_{k¯}≡γk*, which must also appear in Eq. (6). The solvation coordinate can now be expressed in the dissipatons decomposition form [31,32]
with
It is easy to verify that both Eqs. (6) and (7) are reproduced. As defined above, dissipatons consist of linear and statistically independent macroscopic bath degrees of freedoms. Each dissipaton is associated with a single exponent that can be complex, for its forward and backward correlation functions. The implication here will be elaborated later; see Eqs. (16) and (17).
Dynamical variables in the DEOM theory are the dissipaton density operators (DDOs) [31,32],
Apparently, the reduced system density operator is just ρ_{S}(t)≡ρ0(0)(t). The indexes n ≡ {n_{1}⋯n_{K}} and n = n_{1} +…+ n_{K} specify the configuration in terms of occupations and the total number of dissipatons, respectively. The irreducible notation, (…)°, highlights the fact that ρn(n)(t) defined above is truly an n-dissipaton quantity. This notation is also followed by (f^{k}f^{j})°=(f^jf^k){◦}, the identity for Bosonic dissipatons that satisfy the symmetric permutation. Moreover, it will be used in reporting the generalized (non-Gaussian) Wick’s theorems [cf. Eq. (18)], the essential ingredients of dissipaton algebra; see Sec. II B.
It will be evident in Sec. II B that DEOM theory can be considered as the dissipaton algebra, together with the Schrödinger equation. The latter refers to
with the total composite density operator satisfying
The dissipaton algebra consists of the generalized diffusion equation and the generalized (non-Gaussian) Wick’s theorems. These two components evaluate the bath h_{B}-action and the system-bath coupling H_{SB}-action, via the last two terms of H_{T} in Eq. (1), respectively.
The final DEOM formalism in the presence of both linear and quadratic bath couplings reads
Here, L_{S}Ô=[H_{S},Ô], with
and
B. The dissipaton algebra in the DEOM theory
1. The generalized diffusion equation
As defined in Eq. (9), each dissipaton is associated with a single exponent, for its forward and backward correlation functions, Eq. (9). This feature leads to the generalized diffusion equation [31,32],
This together with ∂f^{k}∂t{B}=−i[f^{k},h_{B}] will be used to treat the action of the bath Hamiltonian. The influence of the bath h_{B}-action on the DDO is then evaluated as
This is the sum-over-exponents term in Eq. (13).
2. The generalized Wick’s theorems
The Generalized Wick’s Theorem-1 (GWT-1) evaluates the linear bath coupling, where one dissipaton is added each time. It reads [31,32]
The expression of tr_{B}(f^Kn_{K}⋯f^1n_{1})°ρ_{T}(t)f^{j} is similar, but with ⟨f^{k}f^{j}⟩B> being replaced by ⟨f^{j}f^{k}⟩B<. Here [cf. Eq. (9)]
The associated index nk± differs from n ≡ {n_{1}…n_{K}} by replacing the specified n_{k} with n_{k} ± 1. This specifies the (n ± 1)-particle DDO, ρnk±(n±1)(t), in Eq. (18). The Q^{S}x^{B}-action, with x^{B}=∑_{j}f^{j} [Eq. (8)], can then be readily evaluated, resulting in Refs [31] and  [32]
This contributes to the last term in Eq. (13). The superoperators A and C had been defined in Eq. (15).
The GWT-2 is related to the quadratic bath coupling, where a pair of dissipatons are added each time. We evaluated it as [25]
The associated DDO index, nkj±±, differs from n ≡ n_{1}…n_{K} on the specified subindexes, n_{k} and n_{j}, that are replaced by n_{k} ± 1 and n_{j} ± 1, respectively. Together with Eqs. (8) and (19), we obtain
The expression of tr_{B}(f^Kn_{K}⋯f^1n_{1})°ρ_{T}(t)x^B2 is similar, but with ν_{k} and ν_{j} being replaced by νk¯* and νj¯*, respectively. Therefore [25],
with A, B_{kj}, and C_{k} being defined in Eqs. (15). The first term here, which together with the H_{0}+α_{0}Q^{S} from Eq. (1), contributes to H_{S} of Eq. (14). The last three terms in Eq. (23) contribute to the α_{2}-terms in Eq. (13).
We have thus completed the derivations of the DEOM formalism, Eq. (13), with the total composite Hamiltonian of Eq. (1). The bridge between Eq. (13) and the Liouville–von Neumann equation (12) is the generalized diffusion equation and the generalized Wick’s theorems presented above. These ingredients of the dissipaton algebra, including the most recent GWT-2, Eq. (21), have all been established [25,31,32].
C. Comments
Some additional features are as follows. In the absence of quadratic coupling (α_{2} = 0), Eq. (13) reduces to the previous result [31,32], which is identical to the hierarchical-equations-of-motion formalism [4–9]. The latter is a path integral influence functional based theory [1], with {ρn(n>0)} being considered as mathematical auxiliaries. The above observations validate the generalized diffusion equation (16) that leads to Eq. (17), and the GWT-1, Eq. (18) that, together with its time-reversal counterpart, leads to Eq. (20). While the conventional diffusion equation [41] and Wick’s theorem [3] are concerned only with c-number properties of Gaussian statistics, those two generalizations, Eqs. (16) and (18), go with reduced operators in the system-subspace, with the arbitrary Hamiltonian H_{S} and arbitrary dissipative mode Q^{S}.
Nevertheless, the GWT-2, Eq. (21), which had been validated in the high-temperature regime [25], is subject to further scrutiny. The resulted ⟨f^jf^j^{′}⟩{B} [cf. the second term in Eq. (21)] is just the bath ensemble average on the product of the specified pair without time ordering. As inferred from its construction, Eq. (21) would be an Ehrenfest mean-field type of treatment on quadratic bath couplings. We will defer this issue to future study.
III. CHARACTERIZATIONS ON LINEAR AND QUADRATIC BATH COUPLINGS
A. Solvation mode description
To complete the quantum dissipation theory with nonlinear coupling environments, we shall further have physically supported α-parameters. In the presence of quadratic bath couplings, the α-parameters cannot be characterized solely via the linear response theory. In the following, we adopt the well-established linear solvation model [18,42–45] and extend it to a unified characterization on both the linear and quadratic bath coupling α-parameters. In this model, the last term of Eq. (1) arises from the surrounding environment rearrangements in response to the dissipative system operator Q^{S}. The solvation model approach is to rewrite Eq. (1) as
with
The kinetics energies in hB′ and h_{B} are the same. The surrounding environment rearrangements, which hybridize with the system dissipative mode Q^{S}, is measured by the potential energies difference; i.e., δh_{B}=vB′−v_{B}. The overall bath involves both x^{B}, defined in Eq. (2), and the secondary bath coordinates, x̃≡{x̃{k}}.
To highlight the fact that the solvation dynamics, x^{B}(t)=e^{ihBt}x^{B}e^{−ihBt}, is a Brownian motion in the bare bath, we recast the reference bath h_{B} of Eq. (2) in Caldeira–Leggett’s interaction form [42],
The potential energy here is given by
with x̃≡{x̃{k}},
The resultant classical friction kernel function reads [38]
The Langevin force is given by F̃(t)=e^{ih̃t}X̃e^{−ih̃t}, where h̃=12∑_{k}ω̃{k}(p̃k2+x̃k2) is the secondary bath Hamiltonian. The above Brownian oscillator descriptions result in Eq. (4) the well-established relation [3,38],
where
The relevant hB′ in Eq. (25) is similar as Eqs. (26)–(28),
It has the identical kinetic energy as that in Eq. (26), but a different potential energy [cf. Eqs. (27) and (28)],
with
Here,
Therefore the two reference bath Hamiltonians differ by
where
Apparently, [I] and [II] describe the linear and quadratic bath couplings, respectively, whereas [0] = α_{0}. The associating α-parameters could be determined via the statistical effect of the secondary bath on the solvation coordinate. In other words, one should effectively relate {x̃{k}} with x^{B} so that [I]=α_{1}x^{B} and [II]=α_{2}x^B2.
In our previous work [25], we considered a linear-displacement-mapping (LDM) ansatz, assuming that the secondary bath was of x̃k′=x̃{k}; i.e., θ̃{k}≡ω̃k′/ω̃{k}=1 and d̃{k}=0 in Eq. (35b). Proposed in this work is an alternative set of LDM rules, based on the exact results of pure-linear displacements’ case where d_{k} ≠ 0; see Sec. III B. A new LDM ansatz is followed, which together with the reference-bath invariance requirement determines the α-parameters in Sec. III C. We shall see then that for the completeness of the present coupling bath descriptors, one has to choose θ̃{k}=1 for Eq. (35b). We comment on the final results in conjunction with the DEOM evaluations in Sec. III D.
B. Mapping rules via the linear-displacement limit
For the rules of LDM, we consider in this subsection the results of pure-linear displacements’ (α_{2} = 0) limit, where ωB′=ω_{B} and ω̃k′=ω̃{k}, cf. Eq. (35). Let us start with the original form of bath Hamiltonian, h_{B}, of Eq. (2), and
Let the last term be
Here, x^{B}=∑_{j}c_{j}q^{j}, as defined in Eq. (2); therefore,
The first term in Eq. (38) is then
The last identity is obtained via Eq. (3). Consider now the Kramers–Kronig relation [3,38],
between χB(+)(ω)=Re χ_{B}(ω) and χB(−)(ω)=Im χ_{B}(ω). Here P denotes the principle part. As χB(−)(ω=0)=0, we have
The last identity is obtained by using Eq. (30). Substituting Eq. (43) into Eq. (41), we obtain
Together with Eq. (39), we obtain Eq. (38) the expression
Turn to the solvation mode description, Eq. (26), in which the overall bath Hamiltonian h_{B} is partitioned into the solvation mode and the secondary bath environments. In the case of pure-linear displacements, where ωB′=ω_{B} and ω̃k′=ω̃{k}, Eq. (35) becomes
Here, d_{B} ≡ ∑_{j}c_{j}d_{j}, as implied in x^{B}≡∑_{j}c_{j}q^{j} via Eq. (2). Using Eqs. (40) and (44), we have
Moreover, in the absence of quadratic couplings, one should also have c̃k′=c̃{k}; cf. Eq. (32) versus Eq. (26). Consequently, Eqs. (37) become [II]{α2=0}=0 and
Here, x̃={x̃{k}} and d̃={d̃{k}} are the column vectors; the superscript T denotes the transpose; ω̃ is a diagonal matrix of frequencies {ω̃{k}}, and [cf. X̃ in Eq. (28)]
Note that X̃−D̃=∑_{k}c̃{k}(x̃{k}−d̃{k}), which appears as the secondary bath analog of x^{B}−d_{B}=∑_{j}c_{j}(q^{j}−d_{j}).
Now from the fact that Eq. (45) is statistically equivalent to hB′−h_{B}=[0]{α2=0}+I_{α2=0} via Eq. (48), we have
Together with Eq. (47), these two expressions are just
These basic requirements would suggest the following rules of mapping:
It seems that only the first two were independent, which would lead to the third mapping and the last two mappings, respectively.
C. The LDM ansatz and reference-bath invariance
The LDM rules [Eq. (51)] are not sufficient for achieving Eq. (37) the required expressions; i.e. [0], = α_{0}, [I]=α_{1}x^{B}, and [II]=α_{2}x^B2, respectively. Adopt further
These two parameters will be determined later; see Eq. (65) and the comments there. The above ansatz, Eq. (52), leads to Eq. (37) the expressions,
The rules of LDM, Eq. (51), have been applied in the individual second expressions above, which now do read as [0] = α_{0}, [I]=α_{1}x^{B}, and [II]=α_{2}x^B2, respectively. To that end we apply ωB′=θ_{B}ω_{B} and d_{B}=(2λ/ωB){12} [Eq. (47)], and also η̃{′}=(φ/θ̃)η̃, where η̃{′} of Eq. (34) is related to η̃ of Eq. (28) via Eq. (52). The resultant α-parameters can then be arranged as
where
To complete the characterization, we examine the reference-bath invariance requirement by recasting the last two terms of Eq. (24) as
This identity relates between the reference-h_{B} and the reference-hB′ based descriptions, with δh_{B}≡hB′−h_{B} being given by Eq. (25), whereas
We obtain
Note that x^B′=θB12(x^{B}−d_{B}) and d_{B}=(2λ/ωB){12} [cf. Eqs. (35) and (47)]. Together with Eq. (54), we obtain
On the other hand, in parallel to Eq. (54), we have
where [cf. Eq. (55)]
Apparently, θ_{B}θB′=θ̃θ̃{′}=φφ^{′}=1, and [cf. Eq. (47)]
Comparing Eqs. (59) and (60), we obtain
We have thus determined the α-parameters in both Eqs. (54) and (60), which stand for the reference-h_{B} and the reference-hB′ based descriptions, respectively.
To conclude this subsection, we should also point out that, for the completeness of description, we have to set θ̃{k}≡ω̃k′/ω̃{k}=1. In fact, Eq. (63) leads to the second terms in Eq. (55) and its equivalent Eq. (61) be zero. It results in a single relation, θ_{B}φ=θ̃{3}, for two undetermined parameters. The uncertainty here reflects also in χB′(ω)=ωB′/[ωB′2−ω^{2}−ωζ^{′}(ω)], the reference-hB′ counterpart to Eq. (30), with [cf. Eqs. (29) and (31)]
The second identity is obtained by using Eq. (52) and the aforementioned result of θ_{B}φ=θ̃{3}. The environment would not be exclusively described by χ_{B}(ω) of Eq. (30) and the α-parameters of Eq. (54) with Eq. (63). To have a quantum dissipation theory description, such as the DEOM in Sec. II, one has to set ζ^{′}(ω) = ζ(ω). This is equivalent to have
We have thus completed the model of the coupling environments considered in this work.
D. Discussions and comments
Let us summarize the present nonlinear solvation model description in conjunction with the DEOM evaluations. First of all, Eqs. (54) and (60), with Eq. (63), are
and
As x^{B} is a stochastic variable, the sign of α_{1} (or α1′) does not matter, but that of α_{2} makes difference. The quadratic coupling strength is dictated by θ_{B}≡ωB′/ω_{B} that enters also explicitly into α_{0}, α_{1}, and α1′. The above two sets of α-parameters, Eqs. (66) and (67), are used in the reference-h_{B} and the reference-hB′ based prescriptions, respectively. In terms of the total composite Hamiltonian, that is [cf. Eq. (56)]
The DEOM theory presented in Sec. II follows the h_{B}-based description. The involving dissipatons {f^{k}} arise from Eq. (5), with χB(−)(ω)=Im χ_{B}(ω) of Eq. (30). Similarly, the hB′-based counterpart goes by
with ζ^{′}(ω) = ζ(ω) [cf. Eqs. (64) and (65)] being identical to that in Eq. (30). The dissipatons {f^k′} now go with χB′{(−)}(ω)=Im χB′(ω) being used in the fluctuation-dissipation theorem [cf. Eq. (5)]. The hB′-based DEOM counterparts to Eqs. (13)–(15) are then followed, by replacing Q^{S} with 1−Q^{S} and the α-parameters with their α′-counterparts, as specified in Eq. (68). As demonstrated later, the present DEOM evaluations on dynamical observables, such as the optical spectroscopies, agree well with the reference-bath invariance requirement.
Finally, we consider the diffusive limit, with the solvation mode in the h_{B}-based and the hB′-based descriptions being characterized, respectively, by
This is the limit of ζ(ω)≈ζ(ω=0)≡ζ≫ω_{B},ωB′, but ωB2/ζ≡γ_{D} and ωB′2/ζ≡γD′ being finite. Let
As it formally satisfies θ_{D}=θB2, Eqs. (66) and (67) in the diffusive limit read, respectively,
and
The DEOM evaluations, with either the Brownian oscillator or the diffusive environment, all agree well with the aforementioned reference-bath invariance requirement. Further elaboration of this aspect will be given in Sec. IV.
IV. ILLUSTRATIONS
Consider first the DEOM evaluations on absorption and emission lineshapes of a two-level system, described by
The last two expressions represent the bath h_{g} and h_{e} based descriptions, associating with the system in the ground and excited states, respectively. The above total composite Hamiltonian does assume the form of Eq. (68), with H_{0}=ω_{eg}ee and Q^{S}=ee that gives 1−Q^{S}=gg, whereas
The α- and α′-parameters were summarized in Sec. III D. For numerical demonstrations, we adopt
All frequency variables are reported in units of ωBg. We set γ̃=10, η̃=15, and k_{B}T = 1. Set also λ = 1, except for the linear-bath-coupling-free case where λ = 0.
The DEOM evaluations can be carried out with either the h_{g}-based or the h_{e}-based prescription. For an adiabatic two-level system, Eq. (74), the DEOM in each prescription has two steady-state solutions. They are the thermal equilibrium ground and excited states and used as the initial states for the DEOM evaluations of the absorption and emission spectrums, respectively. In particular, the DEOM (13) in the h_{g}-based prescription has the equilibrium ground state of ρn(n)|geq=ρ0(0)δ_{n0}, whereas the excite state correspondences, ρn(n);n≥0eeq, need to be evaluated [32]. The steady-state solutions to the h_{e}-based DEOM are just the opposite. The reference-bath invariance requires the DEOM evaluations on optical spectrums be identical, with either the h_{g}-based or the h_{e}-based prescription. The present DEOM formalism numerically well preserves the prescription invariance property, without viable deviations in the following demonstrations.
Figure 1 reports the absorption (solid) and emission (dashed) line shapes for the non-Markovian Brownian oscillator bath. Spectrums are scaled individually to have the same peak height in each panel. In the absence of quadratic bath coupling (i.e., α_{2} = 0), the emission spectrum is the mirror image of the absorption, and each line shape profile appears to be symmetric around its peak position; see Fig. 1(c). Both the symmetric lineshape and the mirror image relations break down whenever the quadratic bath coupling exists; see Figs. 1(a) and 1(b). The observed skews in individual lineshape profiles are all in qualitative agreements with the secondary-bath-free but analytical results [13]. The demonstrations here go with θBredθBblack=1. In the pure quadratic case, the absorption (solid, with either red or black) and the emission (dashed, with different color) are mirror images to each other, due to the inversed frequency arrangement here; see Fig. 1(b). In Fig. 1(a), the (L + Q)-case, the absorption and emission peaks become broader and unsymmetrical, and the aforementioned mirror image relation is broken.
Figure 2 depicts the dynamics of population transfer and reduced system entropy of a two-level system; see the parameters in the caption. The blue dashed-dotted curves are for the pure linear-bath-coupling case, in which (α_{0}, α_{1}, α_{2}) = (1, −1.414, 0) in units of ω_{B}; see Eq. (66). The red dashed curves are for the pure quadratic-bath-coupling case, in which (α_{0}, α_{1}, α_{2}) = (0, 0, −0.22). The black curves take both the above λ = 1 and θ_{B} = 0.75, which leads to (α_{0}, α_{1}, α_{2}) = (0.56, −0.80, −0.22). Note that the sign of α_{1} does not play any roles since it associates with x^{B} that is a stochastic variable. The quadratic bath coupling effect here is rather significant.
V. CONCLUDING REMARKS
In summary, we have developed a comprehensive theory for the lowest nonlinear bath descriptors. Considering it is a linear-plus-quadratic coupling environment with the reference-bath invariance description; see Eqs. (74) and (75) for illustrations. The key steps in the development include the linear-displacement-mapping rules and ansatz [Eqs. (51) and (52)]. It is well known that the effects of linear bath are completely characterized by the linear response theory [3,38]. The descriptors there consist of the reorganization energy, λ of Eq. (44), and the bath susceptibility function, χ_{B}(ω) of Eq. (30). Remarkably, the additional quadratic bath coupling requires only one extra parameter, θ_{B}≡ωB′/ω_{B}≠1. This additional parameter enters not only the quadratic coupling strength α_{2} but also the effective linear strength α_{1} and reorganization α_{0}, as specified in Eq. (66). For completeness, we consider also the diffusive limit; see Eqs. (70)–(73) for the results.
We have also critically examined the recently proposed extended DEOM formalism [25], which is exact for the pure-linear coupling bath limit [31,32]. In view of its construction, as discussed at the end of Sec. II, this extended approach resembles an Ehrenfest mean-field-type treatment on quadratic bath couplings. As a result, it would only be applicable in a limited range, estimated to be about 0.7<ωB′/ω_{B}<1.4 due to our numerical test so far. Nevertheless, those applicable DEOM results, covering from the non-Markovian Brownian oscillator to the diffusive bath environments, are found to be in very good agreement with the reference-bath invariance requirement. Efforts toward an exact theory with nonlinear coupling baths and extensions from two-level to multi-level systems are under way.
