Engineering of electronic properties of single layer graphene by swift heavy ion irradiation
In this work, swift heavy ion irradiation induced effects on the electrical properties of single layer graphene are reported. The modulation in minimum conductivity point in graphene with in-situ electrical measurement during ion irradiation was studied. It is found that the resistance of graphene layer decreases at lower fluences up to 3 × 10^{11} ions/cm^{2}, which is accompanied by the five-fold increase in electron and hole mobilities. The ion irradiation induced increase in electron and hole mobilities at lower fluence up to 1 × 10^{11} ions/cm^{2} is verified by separate Hall measurements on another irradiated graphene sample at the selected fluence. In contrast to the adverse effects of irradiation on the electrical properties of materials, we have found improvement in electrical mobility after irradiation. The increment in mobility is explained by considering the defect annealing in graphene after irradiation at a lower fluence regime. The modification in carrier density after irradiation is also observed. Based on findings of the present work, we suggest ion beam irradiation as a useful tool for tuning of the electrical properties of graphene.
I. INTRODUCTION
Graphene is a promising material for modern age technological applications. Graphene's hexagonal network of carbon atoms presents a rich source of physics as the charge carriers have different guiding equations, unlike their three dimensional counterpart graphite. High charge carrier mobility, high mechanical strength, high optical transmittance, together with atomic thickness, make it possible to use graphene in ultrafast transistors, super capacitors, solar cell, sensors, and optoelectronic devices [1]. The superior electrical properties of graphene over silicon are useful in electronic devices which may be used in space applications [2–4]. The main issue with the graphene-based devices, used in space radiation environment, is their electrical stability, as the damage/amorphization may adversely affect its mobility/conductivity. The transport properties of graphene are very sensitive towards various kinds of ionizing as well as nonionizing radiations such as electron, proton, neutron, and photons. Therefore, various studies have been undertaken to understand the graphene's electrical performance in space environment by simulating the same with different kinds of irradiation. There are several reports on the effect of these radiations on the structural properties of graphene [3–11]. Researchers have found that graphene does not get amorphized under electron beam irradiation up to a certain dose and exploited this property in different applications such as TEM imaging of single protein cell, encapsulation of MoS_{2} devices under graphene, etc [12–13]. Structural and electrical modifications in graphene caused by keV energy ion irradiation [14–17] have been studied, and it is found that low energy ion irradiation degrades high electrical mobility of graphene. There are also a few reports on radiation response of graphene to high energy photons which indicated the instability of graphene under high energetic photon irradiation [18–20]. A recent study suggests that 25 keV energy proton with 7.5 × 10^{17} proton/cm^{2} fluence converts defect free single layer graphene into a complete amorphous state [21]. The effect of swift heavy ion (SHI, energy ∼1 MeV/nucleon) irradiation on graphene's structural stability is studied in our previous work, and it is concluded that graphene remains stable under SHI irradiation at a high fluence up to 1 × 10^{13} ions/cm^{2}, besides observing SHI induced annealing effect in graphene [8,9].
The present study focuses on the tuning of the electrical properties of single layer graphene with 100 MeV Ag ion irradiation at different fluences and emphasizes the use of ion beam to anneal the defects and improve its electrical properties. In Sec. II A, we briefly explain the contact fabrication process over single layer graphene for in-situ electrical measurements. The irradiation details are given in Sec. II B. In Sec. III, the results of SHI induced annealing effects, improvements in electron and hole mobilities of SHI irradiated graphene, and tuning of minimum conductivity point by ion irradiation are presented.
II. METHODS
A. Fabrication of graphene field effect transistor
Single/bilayer graphene samples obtained from Graphene Laboratories, Inc. (USA), were used for electrical measurements. These graphene samples were grown on a Cu substrate by CVD method and transferred over the SiO_{2}/Si substrate using polymethyl-methacrylate (PMMA) support [22,23]. The transferred CVD graphene samples over SiO_{2}/Si substrate have a thick layer of PMMA over graphene [24], which can be removed by etching in high purity acetone. The 1 × 1 cm^{2} graphene sample was dipped in 100 ml acetone for 20 h at room temperature. The acetone was changed two times, at the interval of 7 h, to get the best removal of PMMA coating. The insulating nature of SiO_{2} layer (experimentally measured resistance ∼200 MΩ) acts as a barrier between graphene and Si substrate. The optical and SEM images of single/bilayer graphene samples confirm the good quality continuous film. In the present case, the layer thickness of SiO_{2} is 285 nm, which is helpful in identification of areas covering graphene over the substrate. The drain-source channel of the gated field effect transistor (GFET) was defined by carefully scratching lines with a diamond cutter over the continuous graphene film of the dimension of 500 μm × 1000 μm. The area between the scratch lines is covered by graphene and was isolated from the rest of the sample. Indium metal contacts were used to define drain-source for electrical connections. For this purpose, a small bead of indium was melted over the predefined channel edge. Indium is chosen for making contact due to its low work function. Two small beads of indium (size ∼400 μm) were taken and placed over the predefined graphene channel at a distance of ∼1000 μm. Utmost care was taken to avoid any damage to the graphene channel during bead placing. The sample was then heated up to ∼160 °C in air for 30 min. The size of the contact is ∼400 μm, and the distance between the contacts is ∼700 μm. Figure 1(a) shows the schematic of a graphene sample with indium contacts over it. These GFETs were used for in-situ electrical studies. Another device, as shown in Fig. 1(b), is fabricated with the above said method for Hall effect measurements. In-situ electrical measurements on GFETs were performed with the help of a parametric semiconductor analyzer (model no. Keysight B1500A). The 285 nm thick SiO_{2} layer acts as a gate dielectric. The GFET sample was mounted on a sample ladder in an irradiation chamber for in-situ measurements, and back gate was taken out using a vacuum feed through and connected to a semiconductor analyzer system. Similar connections were made for resistance measurements using a four probe van der Pauw arrangement. Besides this, two probe I-V measurements were performed on pristine single layer graphene.
B. Irradiation work
The ion irradiations and in-situ electrical measurements on graphene samples were performed in Material Science beamline at IUAC, New Delhi. Irradiation was carried out with 100 MeV Ag^{7+} ions using a 15 MV Pelletron accelerator at IUAC, New Delhi, at various fluences ranging from 1 × 10^{11} to 1 × 10^{14} ions/cm^{2}. The base pressure of the irradiation chamber was of the order of 10^{−6} mbar, and the average ion flux was 6.25 × 10^{9} ions/s. The ion beam is scanned over 1 × 1 cm^{2} area for uniform irradiation of the sample. The full graphene channel together with indium contacts was irradiated at all fluences. In-situ electrical measurements, without removing the sample from the chamber, were performed after each irradiation at successive fluences. Irradiations, as well as the electrical measurements, were done at room temperature.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
Raman measurements were performed on several spots on pristine graphene channel of GFET to check the structural quality of graphene. The insignificant intensity of D peak in Raman spectra of Fig. 2(a) confirms that GFET used for electrical measurements was contamination free. From Raman spectra, it is also clear that GFET has single layer with single sharp 2D peak and I_{G}/I_{2D} ratio ∼0.27, where I_{G} and I_{2D} are the areal intensities of the corresponding G and 2D Raman peak, respectively [25].
Two probe I-V measurements were performed between the source and drain on pristine sample to check the contact performance as well as to estimate graphene's resistance in the pristine device. The voltage range for the I-V measurement was selected between −500 mV to +500 mV to avoid joule heating during the passage of current through the graphene channel and the graphene-contact interface. Figure 2(b) shows the current-voltage plot for one of the pristine sample. The resistance of pristine devices varies from 1 kΩ to 7 kΩ and is in agreement with existing data in literature [26].
The pure ohmic behavior of I-V curve also confirmed the ohmic nature of contacts [27]. I-V measurements also ensured that conduction is taking place through the graphene layer and not through the oxide layer which has the resistance in MΩ order. The measurements were repeated several times and they showed repeatability and consistency. The stability of contacts was very good as it works well after several cycles of operations.
A. I-V characteristics of irradiated graphene
In-situ I-V measurements at different fluences were performed to check the electrical performance of graphene in irradiation environment. I-V characteristics showed a linear behavior in the chosen voltage range for all the fluences. The graphene sample's resistance in the pristine state as well as after irradiation at different fluences is estimated and plotted with fluences as shown in Fig. 3. It shows that the resistance of the graphene channel first decreases and then increases rapidly with respect to the ion fluence. The decrease in the resistance (resistivity) of graphene signifies the ion beam induced annealing effect, which is expected to dominate at lower fluences [8].
The region up to 3 × 10^{12} ions/cm^{2} is shown in the inset of Fig. 3 to show the change in resistance more clearly in the lower fluence region. It is evident from the inset that resistance decreases from pristine value of 2.1 kΩ to 1.2 kΩ up to a fluence of 3 × 10^{11} ions/cm^{2} after which it increases rapidly and attains a value of around 27 kΩ at a fluence of 1 × 10^{14} ions/cm^{2}. The initial decrease in resistance at lower fluences is correlated with annealing of defect in the graphene lattice. In our previous work [8], purification of graphene is reported with 100 MeV Ag ion at lower fluences, where it is shown that defects are annealed out after irradiation at lower fluences. When the ion beam passes through graphene, it creates nanometer sized cylindrical zones at different temperatures, referred as halo and core (as explained in our previous work [8]) in graphene. The halo region is responsible for annealing of defects, whereas the core region is responsible for the introduction of the damaged/disordered region. The damage and annealing due to ion beam thus occurs simultaneously. At a low fluence, the coverage of the core area is much less than that of the halo area. So, annealing of defects occurs in much larger area rather than irreversible damage of graphene by the core region. However, at a higher fluence, these core regions are so large in number that the core area starts overlapping and the damage dominates over annealing. Hence, we can expect that annealing will increase up to a fluence of 1 × 10^{11} ions/cm^{2} when the halo regions cover the sample and a higher defect density at a high fluence is expected where the core region starts overlapping.
During the CVD growth process of graphene over different substrates, the disordered regions of amorphous carbon are often introduced inside the graphene's perfect hexagonal structure [28]. These disordered carbon regions are recrystallized into ordered graphene regions at suitable annealing temperatures [29]. Swift heavy ion induced annealing of defects has been observed in soft matters like polymers and carbon nanostructures [30–34]. We expect that ion beam induced local heating recrystallizes the disordered region of sp^{2} amorphous carbon in graphene and improves the overall graphene's structural quality. The removal of adatoms also contributes to ion induced defects' annealing. The defect annealing by removing of adatoms is reported [35], where localized thermal annealing (by passages of current) removes adatoms from the graphene surface and resistance of graphene sheet decreases after annealing. In our case, adatoms type of defects on the graphene may be removed in the halo regions of each ion impact.
Reduction in charge carrier scattering is expected after defect annealing in graphene [16,26,36,37]. As charge carriers' scattering is reduced after irradiation, the resistance decreases at lower fluences. At a higher fluence, graphene resistance increases rapidly which can be attributed to the increase in the scattering centers at a higher fluence [14]. At a higher fluence, the modification of graphene is dominated by defect production. Therefore, at higher fluences, the defect density increases rapidly which causes scattering of charge carriers and the resistance of graphene sheet increases at a higher fluence.
B. Transfer characteristic
The transfer characteristic is referred as the modulation in drain current with gate voltage in the field effect transistor. In-situ electrical measurements on graphene were performed to check the drain current modulation with the gate voltage at different ion fluences. The electrical connection on graphene to measure gate modulation in FET configuration is shown in Fig. 4(a).
Graphene has an ambipolar effect. The charge carriers can be tuned in between hole and electron by application of the gate voltage [38]. Graphene is a semi-metal with zero bandgap. Its conduction and valence bands meet at the Dirac point without application of any gate bias as shown in Fig. 4(b). When a gate voltage is applied, the Fermi level moves into conduction or valence band depending upon the gate voltage and introduces free charge carriers. When the negative gate voltage is applied, positioning of the Fermi level moves into the valance band below the Dirac point and introduces a significant population of holes into the valence band. Under the positive gate potential, the Fermi level moves into the conduction band above the Dirac point, promoting a significant population of electrons into the conduction band. When the gate voltage is applied, it creates a potential difference between the graphene and the gate electrode. Negative gate bias induces holes in the graphene whereas the positive gate bias induces electrons. The gate voltage induced charge carriers can be calculated using the formula [39]
where C_{g} is the gate capacitance per unit area, V_{g} is the gate voltage, V_{Dirac} is the gate voltage at Dirac point, and e is the electronic charge. The value of gate capacitance per unit area C_{g} depends on the thickness of the SiO_{2} layer [39]
where ε_{o} and ε_{r} are the permittivity of free space and the relative permittivity of SiO_{2}, respectively. The extracted value of the gate capacitance is 1.21 × 10^{−4 }F/m^{2} (Ref [39]) by using ε_{o} = 8.854 × 10^{−12 }F/m, ε_{r} = 3.9, and the SiO_{2} thickness d = 285 nm.
The drain to source voltage was kept constant at +0.1 V during all the measurements. The drain-source voltage sets a drain current in the graphene channel between the drain and source which is tuned by the gate voltage. The gate voltage is varied in the range of −40 to +80 V. The transfer characteristics at different fluences are plotted in Fig. 5.
It is clear from Fig. 5 that after irradiating at fluence 1 × 10^{11} ions/cm^{2}, the corresponding electron and hole branches get steeper, thus signifying the increase in mobilities of both electrons as well as holes at this fluence. This has been attributed to the ion induced annealing of defects at 1 × 10^{11} ions/cm^{2} as explained earlier. The variation in mobility at subsequent fluences will be discussed later. It is also observed that at 1 × 10^{11} ions/cm^{2}, the transfer curve maintains its symmetrical shape, whereas at subsequent fluences, the increased asymmetry in electron and hole conduction is attributed to the doping effect in graphene.
In transfer characteristics, the Dirac voltage defines a voltage at which the drain current shows a minimum. The gate voltage corresponding to minimum drain current should be at zero in the case of defect free graphene. In the presence of impurity/doping/disorder in graphene, the minimum conductivity point shifts to either side of 0 V depending upon the nature of doping [40]. Current conduction is dominated by one type of charge carrier on either side of the Dirac point. From Fig. 5, it is observed that pristine graphene has a Dirac voltage at +22.8 V which may be attributed to doping of holes from chemical residues in transfer process [41]. The Dirac voltage of pristine and irradiated graphene at different fluences is recorded and plotted in Fig. 6.
From Fig. 6, it is clear that the Dirac voltage always has a positive shift after irradiation which is attributed to hole doping in graphene after irradiation. Different reports [42,43] observed similar hole doping in graphene after thermal annealing of graphene in vacuum over the SiO_{2} substrate. The hole doping is attributed to the substrate coupling, where the charge from the substrate is transferred into the graphene in annealing process. In the present case, the ion beam interacts with graphene and the underlying SiO_{2} layer. Ion beam induced local heating in graphene may help graphene-SiO_{2} interface coupling which may induce hole doping in graphene, and hence, an overall positive shift in the Dirac voltage at all fluences is observed. An overall positive doping at all fluences is also expected as SHI irradiation may leave the SiO_{2} substrate positively charged [44], which can subsequently trap the electrons from the graphene and leave graphene hole dominated. Defects may cause a shift of the Fermi levels by accepting or donating charge, which influences the position of Dirac point. In our case, the defects contribute a p-type doping, which results in the shifting of Dirac point continuously toward the positive gate voltage as shown in Fig. 6. The hole doping is also possible by variation in charge carrier concentration after irradiation. To study the variation in charge carrier concentration induced by ion irradiation, we performed Hall measurements at selected fluences. Hall measurements were performed in ambient condition before and after irradiation. The variation in mobility and carrier concentration extracted from Hall measurement is shown in Fig. 7.
It is clear from Fig. 7 that the percentage change in the charge carrier concentration is positive up to fluence 1 × 10^{12} ions/cm^{2} and it becomes negative at a higher fluence 1 × 10^{13} ions/cm^{2}. The possible reasons for ion induced variation in the charge carrier concentration are discussed below.
1. SHI induced point defects in graphene
Energetic ions interact with graphene as well as the substrate. The interaction of SHI with graphene creates vacancies in graphene lattice. In the case of ion-substrate interactions, substitutional doping of the substrate atoms may be possible at these vacant sites in graphene, which can alter the carrier concentration in graphene.
2. Capturing of SiO_{2} from substrate ion track into graphene lattice
SHI can produce nanometer sized thermal spikes in SiO_{2,} which generates atomic motion in the substrate in the narrow cylindrical region [45]. These mobile atoms are then captured by graphene lattice. The SiO_{2} from the substrate captured by graphene induces charge carriers in graphene which might either increase or decrease the total charge carrier density, depending on the type of carriers and the initial doping. Further Hall measurements on graphene device show (as shown in Fig. 7) a decrease in total carrier density at a fluence of 1 × 10^{13} ions/cm^{2}, which may reduce the Dirac voltage at 1 × 10^{13} ions/cm^{2}.
To further analyse the in-situ electrical data, the mobility of electrons and holes in irradiated graphene is estimated by using the following equation [46]:
where L and W are graphene channel length and width, respectively. In our case, L/W = 1.4 with length 700 μm and width 500 μm and C_{g} = 1.21 × 10^{−4 }F/m. I_{ds}/ΔV_{ds} is the slope of transfer characteristic. For electron and hole mobility calculations, the slope of the respective branch is taken into consideration. The mobility is calculated after successive irradiation fluences and plotted with fluence as shown in Fig. 8.
The electron and hole mobilities of pristine sample are 1287 and 804 cm^{2}/V s, respectively, which are compatible with the values for CVD grown single layer graphene samples as reported in literature [26,47]. The mobility of electrons is more than that of holes. The mobility of electrons and holes first increases at fluence 1 × 10^{11} ions/cm^{2} and then decreases up to fluence 1 × 10^{12} ions/cm^{2} and saturates at a higher fluence. A similar improvement in mobilities after irradiation with 1.14 GeV U^{28+} at a low fluence is found by Ochedowski et_al [48] The improvement in mobility at lower fluence of 1 × 10^{11} ions/cm^{2} is explained by ion irradiation induced defect annealing in graphene and shows consistency with I-V measurements at fluence 1 × 10^{11} ions/cm^{2} (Fig. 3). The similar effect of decrease in resistance and improvement in mobility of graphene after current annealing in vacuum is reported [34] where passage of current produces local heating in graphene around 600 °C. At a higher fluence, the defects increase which act as scattering centers for electrons and holes and reduce its mobility significantly.
Hall measurements for different sets of irradiated samples (Fig. 7) also show the improvement in mobility at low fluence 3 × 10^{11} ions/cm^{2}. However, at subsequent fluences, the mobility increases up to fluence 1 × 10^{13} ions/cm^{2} in Hall measurement data, whereas in-situ electrical measurement data suggest reduction in mobility at 1 × 10^{12} ions/cm^{2} and saturation at subsequent fluences up to 1 × 10^{14} ions/cm^{2}. This inconsistency in the two measurements may be due to different experimental conditions in the two measurements. In-situ electrical measurements were performed in vacuum condition whereas Hall measurements were done in ambient condition before and after irradiation. The measurements done in ambient may be affected due to adsorption of atmospheric contaminations in the graphene surface.
The improvement in mobility due to the decrease in resistance of the graphene sheet in graphene supports our earlier Raman results [8] on defect annealing in graphene at lower fluences induced by SHI.
IV. CONCLUSION
The effect of 100 MeV Ag ion irradiation on the transport properties of single layer graphene is studied. It is found that the resistance of single layer graphene decreases at lower fluence up to 3 × 10^{11} ions/cm^{2}. A positive shift in minimum conductivity voltage is observed at all fluences, which signifies doping in graphene by SHI irradiation. At a lower fluence, the fivefold increase in mobility of electrons and holes is observed, which is attributed to reduced scattering of charge carriers due to annealing of defects in graphene. This result is consistent with our previous study of defect annealing in graphene at lower fluences. The in-situ electrical measurements suggested that the electrical properties of graphene can be tuned with a careful selection of fluence.
