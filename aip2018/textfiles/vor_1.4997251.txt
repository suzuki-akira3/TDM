Efficient design and verification of diagnostics for impurity transport experiments
Recent attempts to measure impurity transport in Alcator C-Mod using an x-ray imaging crystal spectrometer and laser blow-off impurity injector have failed to yield unique reconstructions of the transport coefficient profiles. This paper presents a fast, linearized model which was constructed to estimate diagnostic requirements for impurity transport experiments. The analysis shows that the spectroscopic diagnostics on Alcator C-Mod should be capable of inferring simple profiles of impurity diffusion D_{Z} and convection V_{Z} accurate to better than ±10% uncertainty, suggesting that the failure to infer unique D_{Z} and V_{Z} from experimental data is attributable to an inadequate analysis procedure rather than the result of insufficient diagnostics. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that even a modest spatial resolution can overcome a low time resolution. This approach can be adapted to design and verify diagnostics for transport experiments on any magnetic confinement device.
I. INTRODUCTION: IMPURITY TRANSPORT AND THE NEED TO CHECK DIAGNOSTIC REQUIREMENTS
The transport of impurities plays a critical role in the goal of building a practical fusion reactor [1–3]: impurities radiate energy away and dilute the fusion fuel. Furthermore, measurements of impurity and particle transport provide additional channels to test transport simulations against in order to perform a stronger test of the theory than could be obtained using the electron and ion heat fluxes alone [4–6].
Recent attempts to measure impurity transport coefficients in the Alcator C-Mod tokamak using the laser blow-off approach previously applied to L-mode plasmas [4–8] have failed to yield a unique reconstruction of the profiles of the impurity transport coefficients D_{Z} and V_{Z}. This suggests that either Alcator C-Mod’s diagnostics are insufficient to uniquely reconstruct the profiles of D_{Z} and V_{Z} or the existing data analysis procedure is deficient in some way. Unfortunately, performing a rigorous analysis of D_{Z} and V_{Z} is very computationally expensive [9]; repeatedly applying the full analysis procedure to synthetic data to characterize the diagnostic requirements would be intractable. To address this problem, this paper uses synthetic data to construct a linearized model which can be used to rapidly verify diagnostic requirements without having to perform the costly full analysis.
The analysis shows that Alcator C-Mod’s diagnostics are sufficient to reconstruct simple D_{Z} and V_{Z} profiles accurate to better than ±10% uncertainty. Furthermore, it is discovered that even a modest spatial resolution can overcome the limited time resolution of modern x-ray spectrometers. This is an important result because the previous work on Alcator C-Mod assumed that it was necessary to resolve the rise of the impurity density following an injection, and hence binned together multiple injections to obtain a higher time resolution [4–6,8]. Because each injection is at a different phase with respect to the sawtooth oscillations, this prevents proper handling of the effects of sawteeth, which may be part of the reason why previous attempts have failed to find satisfactory fits to the measured data. The present results imply that it should be possible to reconstruct the transport coefficients from a single injection sampled at 6 ms using an x-ray imaging crystal spectrometer (XICS). These results highlight two possible uses of the linearized model: verifying the suitability of an existing diagnostic setup and optimizing the design of new instruments.
This paper is structured as follows: Sec. II introduces the impurity transport equation. Section III uses the signals resulting from simple D_{Z} and V_{Z} profiles to identify several figures of merit which contain most of the information which can be obtained from an impurity transport experiment. Section IV uses these figures of merit to construct a linearized model which is then used to show that Alcator C-Mod’s diagnostics appear to be sufficient to measure impurity transport. Finally, Sec. V summarizes the implications of this analysis and discusses the path forward.
II. BACKGROUND: TOKAMAK IMPURITY TRANSPORT
This paper is concerned with obtaining estimates of flux surface-averaged impurity transport, described by the radial continuity equation
where n_{Z} is the impurity density, Γ_{Z} is the (radial) impurity flux, Q_{Z} is the source/sink term, and the radial coordinate is taken to be the volumetric minor radius r=V/(2π^{2}R_{0}) in order to handle shaped flux surfaces properly [10]. Note that the present analysis neglects poloidal asymmetries and assumes that n_{Z} is constant on a flux surface. The impurity flux is assumed to consist of a diffusive and a convective component,
where the diffusion coefficient D_{Z} and the convective velocity V_{Z} can both be functions of r.
III. INTUITION FROM TIME-SERIES CHARACTERISTICS
In order to illustrate the effects of diffusion and convection on impurity transport, the 1D impurity transport code STRAHL [10] was run many times with various values of D_{Z} and V_{Z}. The n_{e} and T_{e} profiles and the magnetic equilibrium were taken from an Alcator C-Mod L-mode discharge used for previous impurity transport work [4,5,8]. The source function was taken to be a narrow pulse of calcium to model a delta function. The transport coefficient profiles used were simply
where V is the convective velocity at the edge of the computational domain r = a_{c} [just outside of the last closed flux surface (LCFS)]; see Fig. 1.
In general, a transient impurity injection exhibits two phases: a rapid rise of the plasma impurity content when the impurity flux is inwards followed by a slower decay of the impurity content while the impurity flux is outwards. This is shown in Figs. 2 and 3, which show n_{Z} as a function of time and space. Notice that there is a finite delay between the time of the injection t_{inj} and the time the impurity density peaks and that this delay is different between the core and the edge of the plasma: there is a finite time for the impurities to reach the core. Therefore, one possible figure of merit to describe these signals is the core rise time, denoted by t_{r}. There is more information contained in the rapid spatial and temporal evolution of n_{Z}(r, t) during the influx phase, but this is difficult to measure accurately with the limited spatial and temporal resolution of modern x-ray spectrometers and so is not included in the present analysis. The effect of discarding this information is to make the present analysis pessimistic at high time resolutions.
At times t ≥ t_{r} + δ, there is an exponential decay of the density at all locations, the time constant of which is the impurity confinement time τ_{imp},
As indicated by Eq. (4), τ_{imp} and the normalized profile shape n_{Z}(r, t)/n_{Z}(0, t) completely summarize the behavior during the decay phase.
Note, however, that the initial period of the decay is usually not purely exponential. This is a result of the fact that the impurity density profile shape is still evolving up until about 10 ms after the injection. After this point, the decay is described very well by an exponential with the same time constant at all radii. Therefore, when post-processing the results of STRAHL runs, the impurity confinement time and profile shape are determined by fitting the impurity density from δ = 10 ms after it peaks and on.
The discussion above combined with inspection of n_{Z}(r, t) for different values of D and V implies that three readily measured figures of merit capture how n_{Z} evolves as a function of both space and time:
• the impurity confinement time τ_{imp},
• the core rise time t_{r}, and
• the broadness of the impurity density profile during the exponential decay phase.These correspond to the first and second temporal eigenvalues and the first spatial eigenfunction of the impurity transport equation, respectively [11,12]. The core rise time was chosen over that of other locations as it is the slowest and hence easiest to measure accurately. The broadness of the profile is represented by the ratio b_{r/a} = n_{Z}(r/a)/n_{Z}(0). This was chosen over more sophisticated estimates of profile peaking like n_{Z}(0)/⟨nZ⟩{vol} because it can be estimated from two diagnostic channels and hence enables the measurement to be made with simpler diagnostics. Note that b_{r/a} can be measured at multiple radii to capture the profile shape during the exponential decay following the injection. For simplicity, Secs. IV and V focus on b_{0.75} unless otherwise noted. Plots of these quantities as functions of D and V are given in Figs. 4–6.
IV. LINEARIZED ANALYSIS OF REQUIRED TOLERANCES
This section derives a model describing the inference of the transport coefficients D and V from measurements of τ_{imp}, t_{r}, and b_{r/a} = n_{Z}(r/a)/n_{Z}(0). As illustrated in Sec. III, these three observables represent most of the information which can be readily extracted from spatially and temporally resolved measurements of the impurity density profile, and hence this analysis should be representative of the more complete analysis which combines STRAHL with a synthetic diagnostic in order to find the best fit to the observed diagnostic signals. This analysis is useful because it allows the diagnostic capabilities necessary to reconstruct D and V to a desired precision to be estimated without requiring many computationally expensive STRAHL runs. Furthermore, the following analysis is applicable to any experimental situation which can be cast as an inverse problem of the form y = f(T) where the observables y are a function of the quantities to be inferred T, provided that f(T) can be linearized in a region around the true values bounded by the diagnostic uncertainties.
A. Derivation of the model
As shown in Figs. 4–6, τ_{imp}(D, V), t_{r}(D, V), and b_{0.75}(D, V) have contours that are not parallel to each other. Therefore, provided that the assumed profile shapes for D and V are correct, two or more of these measurements can reconstruct D and V. This is shown in Fig. 7 where the contours corresponding to D = 1 m^{2}/s and V = −10 m/s are shown. This construction allows a simple estimate of the spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and noise level requirements to determine D and V. Note that the following analysis does not account for the uncertainties in the atomic physics data and the background n_{e} and T_{e} profiles nor does it account for the issues inherent in the tomographic inversion of line-averaged measurements.
Consider a measurement of some quantity y_{i} which is a function of both D and V,
Linearize at D = D_{0} and V = V_{0},
where y_{i,0} = y_{i}(D_{0}, V_{0}). To prepare for the next step, write this in vector form,
where C_{i} is the row vector [b_{i}, c_{i}] and T = [D, V]^{T} is the column vector of transport coefficients. Consider each measurement to have Gaussian noise such that the probability density function (PDF) is
where N(μ,σ^{2}) is the Gaussian distribution with mean μ and variance σ^{2}. The joint PDF for n such independent [13] measurements y∈R{n} is then
where a∈R{n} is the vector containing a_{i} for each measurement, C is the n × 2 matrix where each row contains C_{i}, and the covariance matrix Σ_{y} has each σi2 on the diagonal and zeros everywhere else. Assume a Gaussian prior distribution for T,
The posterior PDF for T is then
The Gaussian distribution is self-conjugate, meaning that a Gaussian likelihood with Gaussian prior distribution results in a Gaussian posterior distribution [14,15]. The posterior PDF for T is then given by the standard result for linear Gaussian systems [14],
Now make f_{T}(T) non-informative by making it infinitely wide such that ΣT−1→0,
Note that this is exactly the result of heteroscedastic linear least-squares regression for the model y – a = CT. The use of a Gaussian likelihood and non-informative prior distribution means that this analysis combines the noisy, potentially conflicting observations y to reconstruct the transport coefficients T which are most consistent with the observations in the weighted least-squares sense.
Expanding the covariance matrix given in Eq. (18) yields
Therefore, the (marginal) uncertainties in the individual parameters are
and the covariance is
The predictions are then
This framework allows the use of measurements of any number of figures of merit (including repeated measurements of the same figure of merit) and the estimation of any number of parameters. It can be applied to the inferences to be obtained from any diagnostic provided that the figures of merit to be observed are roughly linear in the parameters to be inferred and the noise on the observations is roughly Gaussian.
B. Determining the required tolerances on τ_{imp}, t_{r}, and b_{0.75}
Now consider the reconstruction of the true parameters D_{0} = 1 m^{2}/s and V_{0} = −10 m/s using measurements of the three parameters discussed previously: τ_{imp}, t_{r}, and b_{0.75}.
These quantities were evaluated over a dense grid covering a ±20% window around the true parameters D_{0} = 1 m^{2}/s and V_{0} = −10 m/s. The coefficients a_{i}, b_{i}, and c_{i} were evaluated for each of the three signals by fitting the results with a bivariate cubic interpolating spline. Because of the discretization error in t_{r} noted in Fig. 5, the spline for t_{r} had a small smoothing parameter to allow an accurate estimate of the derivatives to be obtained. As suggested by Figs. 4–6, the behavior is not necessarily linear. Plots showing the discrepancy between the linearizations and the actual STRAHL results over the region of interest are given in Figs. 8–10. For ±10% uncertainties in the measured figures of merit, the errors in the linearizations are a few percent at most. In particular, τ_{imp} seems to exhibit the most nonlinearity at the edges of the domain. This is not an issue as τ_{imp} is typically the quantity that can be measured to the highest precision because, even at moderate time resolution, there are many samples in the decay of the impurity density. The expected result of combining these three measurements with reasonable uncertainties is shown in Fig. 7.
The 1σ uncertainties in D and V were evaluated over a dense, logarithmically spaced grid of σ_{τimp}, σ_{tr}, and σ_{b0.75} using Eqs. (21) and (22). The isosurfaces in (σ_{τimp},σ_{tr},σ_{b0.75}) space corresponding to σ_{D} = 0.1D_{0} and σ_{V} = 0.1|V_{0}| are given in Fig. 11. These isosurfaces were computed using the marching cubes algorithm in scikit-image [16,17]. The figure illustrates what is intuitively expected: when any two quantities are known to high precision, the third quantity becomes redundant and has very low required precision.
C. Determining the number of spatial channels, sampling rate, and noise level
1. Procedure
In order to determine the diagnostic parameters which enable D and V to be reconstructed, synthetic data sets were constructed with a variety of sampling rates, noise levels, and spatial resolutions. The time resolution was varied over the range 10^{−4} s ≤ Δt ≤ 10^{−2} s, the relative noise level was varied over the range 10^{−3} ≤ u ≤ 1, and the calculation was performed for N_{s} ∈ {1, 3, 5, 32} spatial points. The 32 point case corresponds roughly to the spatial resolution of the High Resolution X-ray Spectrometer with Spatial Resolution (HiReX-SR) XICS instrument on Alcator C-Mod [18], though note that this analysis does not treat the details of the tomographic inversion necessary to convert the line-integrated measurements to local measurements. For the single point case, the value n_{Z}(0) at the core of the plasma was used. For the other cases, the points were equally spaced over 0 ≤ r/a ≤ 1. For each point in (Δt, u, N_{s}) space, 10^{3} realizations were constructed. The phase of each realization with respect to the injection was varied by taking the sampling to start at a time uniformly distributed over t_{inj} − Δt ≤ t_{0} ≤ t_{inj}. For N_{s} > 1, all N_{s} − 1 of the ratios b_{r/a} = n_{Z}(r/a)/n_{Z}(0) for r/a ≠ 0 were included in the inference, and the coefficients of the linearization of each b_{r/a}(D, V) were computed as described above.
For each realization, t_{r} is determined by fitting a weighted cubic smoothing spline [19,20] to the noisy synthetic n_{Z}(0, t). The weights were set to 1/σ_{t} = 1/(uy_{t}) (where y_{t} is the value of the signal at time t) and the smoothing parameter was left at the default value. This spline is then evaluated over a dense grid of time values to determine the time at which the impurity density reaches its maximum value. Inspection of the fit and comparison to the high resolution STRAHL output shows that this automated procedure typically produces acceptable results at reasonable time resolutions, with occasional poor fits manifesting as clear outliers which can be rejected automatically by using the median and interquartile range as robust estimates of the mean and standard deviation. Naturally, when the time resolution is slow relative to the rise time, this procedure is unable to recover t_{r}.
The impurity confinement time τ_{imp} is found by adding up the data from all of the spatial points then fitting an exponential to the data for t > t_{inj} + t_{r} + 10 ms. This approach takes into account the increase in precision of the estimate of τ_{imp} which comes from having multiple chords and higher time resolution. As noted above, the behavior is described very well by an exponential with the same time constant at each radius during this phase.
For N_{s} > 1, the broadness factors b_{r/a} are computed by taking the median of b_{r/a}(t) = n_{Z}(r/a, t)/n_{Z}(0, t) over the same set of time points used to fit τ_{imp}. This has the effect of accounting for the improvement in precision on b_{r/a} that comes from having higher time resolution while avoiding the pathologies which arise when taking the ratio of two normally distributed quantities discussed in Sec. 3.4.3.1 of Ref [9].
For each point in (Δt, u, N_{s}) space, the estimate of t_{r} is computed as the median of the results from the realizations. The uncertainty in this estimate is given by σ_{tr}=1.349⋅IQR, where IQR is the interquartile range. As noted above, robust estimators (i.e., the median and interquartile range) are used for this case because there were occasionally poor spline fits which produced outliers. For N_{s} > 1, robust estimators are also used to find b_{r/a} and σ_{br/a} in order to avoid the pathologies mentioned above. Conventional estimators (mean and standard deviation) are used to obtain τ_{imp} and σ_{τimp}. The uncertainties in D and V are then obtained using Eqs. (21) and (22).
Note that all of the following discussion of expected uncertainties in the various observables concerns only the uncertainties arising from random errors in the diagnostic signals. Systematic effects arising from diagnostic calibration errors and variation of the background plasma conditions are likely to dominate the uncertainties in quantities such as τ_{imp} and b_{0.75} which are determined by averages over many points during the exponential decay period. Unfortunately this framework is unable to handle this class of uncertainties.
2. Estimated uncertainties in the figures of merit
The uncertainties in τ_{imp} are given in Fig. 12. As expected, decreasing Δt or u or increasing N_{s} allows τ_{imp} to be determined with a smaller uncertainty.
The uncertainties in t_{r} for the single chord case are given in Fig. 13. While the results are somewhat ragged as a result of the distribution being non-Gaussian because of poor spline fits when determining t_{r}, the behavior is as expected: sampling faster or with lower noise allows t_{r} to be reconstructed with a smaller uncertainty. But for Δt ≳ 5 ms, it is impossible to adequately reconstruct t_{r} accurate to the 0.5 ms level even with very low-noise measurements. The required time resolution is approximately half of the rise time, which makes sense in light of the Nyquist sampling theorem.
The uncertainties in b_{0.75} are given in Fig. 14. As expected, decreasing Δt or u allows b_{0.75} to be measured with a smaller uncertainty. These results are typical of what is seen for any of the b_{r/a}. Increasing N_{s} will effectively constrain V/D better because each channel represents an independent measurement of b_{r/a} ∝ V/D but will not improve the uncertainty in any given b_{r/a} because the measurements at different radii are taken to be independent in the present analysis.
3. Estimated uncertainties in D and V and the diagnostic requirements
The expected uncertainties in D and V are given in Figs. 15 and 16, respectively. For the N_{s} = 1 case, the uncertainties are dominated by σ_{tr}, and hence a very fine time resolution and low noise level is required. For the N_{s} = 3 case, the reliance on t_{r} has almost been completely removed, and it is possible to use a much slower sampling rate: the conventional intuition that a high time resolution during the rise is necessary to separate D from V appears to be incorrect, as mediocre time resolution (simply sufficient to estimate τ_{imp}) combined with modest spatial resolution should be able to reconstruct D and V accurate to better than 10%. This is a very important result, as it suggests that modern XICS instruments with temporal resolutions around 6 ms should be able to estimate D and V from a single injection, which will enable the effects of sawteeth to be handled properly.
In order to gain some intuition for the parameter ranges indicated, consider a diagnostic which is dominated by photon statistics: the number of photons reaching the detector is Poisson-distributed, with an average rate of λ photons per second. Therefore, the relative noise level corresponding to data collected during a sampling interval Δt is [21]
The HiReX-SR XICS diagnostic on Alcator C-Mod typically has a relative uncertainty of about 1%–5% at the 6 ms sampling interval used for impurity transport studies; the relative noise as a function of time resolution extrapolated from this is shown as the dashed red line in Figs. 15 and 16. The XEUS vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) spectrometer [22] typically obtains a relative uncertainty of about 1%–2% with a 2 ms sampling interval; the relative noise for this instrument is shown as the dotted cyan line. The soft x-ray (SXR) arrays [23] on Alcator C-Mod sample at 4 μs and have enough signal strength to lie off the scale of the figures. The XICS and VUV diagnostics are only just inside the envelope of being able to reconstruct D and V to the ±10% level, but the SXR instruments should be more than capable of delivering this level of precision, provided that the atomic physics model used to infer n_{Z} from the SXR emissivities is sufficiently accurate. Therefore, this analysis implies that SXR instruments with high throughput and high temporal and spatial resolution have the best chance of being able to reconstruct D and V. But because of the complexity of the atomic physics model necessary to interpret SXR measurements, spectroscopic diagnostics are invaluable both as an extra signal to constrain the inference and as a cross-check of the results from the SXR measurements using simpler atomic physics.
Recall that these results were obtained using very simple, single-parameter D_{Z} and V_{Z} profiles. It is of course expected that additional spatial and temporal resolution will be necessary to reconstruct more complicated profile shapes. That being said, given that the basic characteristics seen here (a rapid influx followed by a gradual decay with time constant τ_{imp}) are ubiquitous in impurity transport measurements, there is reason to believe that some of the intuition from the simple case will carry over to the more general case. Furthermore, provided that the relationship between the observables and parameters remains roughly linear in the region bounded by the uncertainties in the observables, the framework presented here can be used to estimate the requirements to infer profiles characterized by many more parameters than were considered here: given D_{Z} and V_{Z} profiles characterized by parameters T, the terms in Eqs. (18) and (19) are now
where T_{0} is the point to linearize about. There may be complicated correlations between the various parameters, which will be captured by the off-diagonal elements of the covariance matrix in Eq. (18). Note that the curse of dimensionality makes use of a dense grid in parameter space to evaluate y_{i}(T) very computationally expensive. A better strategy for such cases would be to compute the derivatives needed for the linearization with just a few STRAHL runs using finite differences and then use a few more runs to check the accuracy of the linearization.
V. SUMMARY AND FUTURE WORK
This paper has presented a technique for constructing a linearized model to estimate the diagnostic requirements to reconstruct the transport coefficient profiles D_{Z} and V_{Z} accurate to a desired level. While the approach was demonstrated on the simple profiles given in Eq. (3), it can be easily expanded to use more complicated models. This model suggests that Alcator C-Mod’s diagnostics should be capable of reconstructing simple D_{Z} and V_{Z} profiles accurate to at least ±10% uncertainty. Furthermore, it was found that even modest spatial resolution more than compensates for poor temporal resolution, in contrast with longstanding assumptions about how to best observe transient impurity injections. This suggests that it should be possible to use the 6 ms XICS time resolution on Alcator C-Mod to analyze a single injection such that the effects of sawteeth can be handled properly. While this analysis was conducted using very simple D_{Z} and V_{Z} profiles, it suggests that the difficulties encountered when analyzing recent transport experiments in Alcator C-Mod may not be the result of the low diagnostic time resolution and that instead the full procedure for inferring D_{Z} and V_{Z} from the experimental data needs to be revised.

FIG. 2. 
Temporal evolution of the impurity density n_{Z} at several radii for D = 1 m^{2}/s and V = −10 m/s. The vertical scale was set to cut off the curve for r/a = 1 in order to show the details at the other radii. Note that all three signals peak at different times because of the finite time for the impurities to penetrate to the core of the plasma.
FIG. 3. 
Temporal evolution of the impurity density profile. Profiles are drawn every 1 ms for the first 10 ms and then every 10 ms after that. During the first 10 ms, the profile shape is evolving as the impurities move from the edge in. After 10 ms, the impurity density decays exponentially with a constant profile shape: n_{Z}(r, t) ≈ n_{Z}(r, 10 ms) exp(−(t − 10 ms)/τ_{imp}).
FIG. 4. 
Impurity confinement time τ_{imp} as a function of D and V. The coloring and the contours are logarithmically spaced. Outside of the low D, a strongly negative V region where accumulation occurs, and τ_{imp} is a function of both D and V.
FIG. 5. 
Core rise time t_{r} as a function of D and V. The coloring and the contours are logarithmically spaced. The “zigzag” shape of the low t_{r} contours arises from the 10 μs time resolution. Outside of the low D, a strongly negative V region where accumulation occurs, and t_{r} is a function primarily of D.
FIG. 6. 
Impurity density profile broadness b_{0.75} = n_{Z}(0.75)/n_{Z}(0) as a function of D and V. The coloring and the contours are linearly spaced and the coloring saturates at b_{0.75} = 1. The contours are lines from the origin, which means they are also contours of V/D. Other radii exhibit similar behavior.
FIG. 7. 
Contours of τ_{imp} (blue solid), t_{r} (green dashed), and b_{0.75} (red dotted) for D = 1 m^{2}/s and V = −10 m/s (white point). Each measurement is shown with its ±2σ (i.e., 95% confidence) interval for σ_{τimp}=0.3 ms, σ_{tr}=0.5 ms, and σ_{b0.75}=6×10^{−3}, values loosely representative of the diagnostics on Alcator C-Mod. Any given measurement only constrains D and V to lie in a neighborhood around a contour that extends through all of D and V space. The unique intersection of the contours corresponding to two or more measurements determines D and V. If multiple, noisy measurements are used, then the D and V values which fit their intersection in the least-squares sense are found. The angles of the intersections determine how much information a measurement adds to the inference: the closer to perpendicular the two measurements are, the better they can constrain D and V. The magenta ellipse gives the 95% posterior region for the combination of these three measurements according to Eqs. (21)–(25). The ±2σ bands on the contours are slightly asymmetric because they were generated using the actual STRAHL outputs and not the linearization.
FIG. 8. 
Discrepancy between the actual τ_{imp} obtained from the STRAHL outputs and the linearized τ^{imp}. The green solid contour corresponds to the value of τ_{imp} at D = 1 m^{2}/s and V = −10 m/s and the black dotted contours represent ±10% around this value.

Discrepancy between the actual b_{0.75} obtained from the STRAHL outputs and the linearized b^{0.75}, presented as in Fig. 8.
FIG. 11. 
Isosurfaces for σ_{D} = 0.1D_{0} (blue) and σ_{V} = 0.1|V_{0}| (green) in (σ_{τimp},σ_{tr},σ_{b0.75}) space. The coloring is proportional to σ_{b0.75} in order to make the vertical changes more visible. The dark lines are logarithmically spaced isolines of σ_{τimp}, σ_{tr}, and σ_{b0.75}. Any point on the surface will enable the quantity to be reconstructed with ±10% 1σ uncertainty. Points below the surface enable a higher precision. The “right angle” features correspond to the fact that given sufficient precision for any two quantities, the third quantity is redundant. For instance, the bright regions in the back corner correspond to both τ_{imp} and t_{r} being known to very high precision. In this case, b_{0.75} is redundant and does not need to be estimated to better than ±100% uncertainty. The surface for V lies below that for D at all points, indicating that D will always be known better than V for reasonably attainable uncertainties.

Uncertainty in impurity confinement time τ_{imp} as a function of Δt, u, and N_{s}. The color scale for all of the subplots is the same and is set to saturate at the maximum value in the N_{s} = 32 plot in order to make the changes visible. The green contour corresponds to σ_{τimp}=0.3 ms, the value used in Fig. 7.
FIG. 13. 
Uncertainty in core rise time t_{r} as a function of Δt and u for N_{s} = 1. (Additional chords do not help to constrain t_{r}.) The green contour corresponds to σ_{tr}=0.5 ms, the value used in Fig. 7. The ragged shape of the contour is the result of poor fits for t_{r} when few points are available in the rise.
FIG. 14. 
Uncertainty in profile broadness b_{0.75} as a function of Δt and u. This result is independent of N_{s} for any grid which contains r/a = 0.75 as the measurements at different radii are taken to be independent in the present analysis. The red dashed contour is σ_{b0.75}=10^{−2}, the point at which b_{0.75} and τ_{imp} are sufficient to reconstruct D and V independent of t_{r}. The green contour is σ_{b0.75}=6×10^{−3}, the precision used in Fig. 7.
FIG. 15. 
Uncertainty in D as a function of Δt, u, and N_{s}. The color scale is the same for all of the subplots and was set to saturate at 0.5 m^{2}/s in order to make the changes visible. The green contour corresponds to σ_{D} = 0.1D_{0}. The red dashed line represents a typical XICS signal level, and the red circle is the Δt = 6 ms time resolution the HiReX-SR instrument is normally operated at for impurity transport studies. Similarly, the cyan dotted line and triangle represent a typical VUV spectrometer signal level and sampling rate.
FIG. 16. 
Uncertainty in V as a function of Δt, u, and N_{s}. The color scale is the same for all of the subplots and was set to saturate at 15 m/s in order to make the changes visible. The green contour corresponds to σ_{V} = 0.1|V_{0}|. The red and cyan lines are as in Fig. 15.
