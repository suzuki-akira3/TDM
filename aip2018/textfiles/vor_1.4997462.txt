Theory of torsional control for G_{16}-type molecules
We introduce a four-dimensional quantum model for describing the torsional control with moderately strong, non-resonant laser pulses of G_{16}-type molecules in the electronic ground state, based on the symmetry-adapted variational method. We define conditions for which lower-dimensional models, commonly used to simulate the strong-field control of molecular torsions, are reliable approximations to a four-dimensional treatment. In particular, we study the role of different types of rotational-torsional couplings—the field-free coupling and the field-induced coupling—and show that the conclusions recently drawn on the role of rotational-torsional couplings in the process of torsional alignment are not correct in general. Furthermore, we demonstrate how important an adequate description of the molecular polarizability is for reliably predicting the torsional alignment.
I. TORSIONAL CONTROL AND MODELS OF REDUCED DIMENSIONALITY
The question of how to control the quantum dynamics of molecular torsions with strong laser pulses has been studied intensively during the last decade. Strategies for effectively controlling torsions with strong laser pulses have been developed [1–5]; numerous applications of torsional control have been studied [3,6–10]; new fundamental effects in the quantum dynamics of molecules have been revealed [9,11]. Due to the complexity of the quantum dynamics of molecules and the high numerical demand of properly describing it, most theoretical [1,3,7–9,11,12] or joint theoretical-experimental [2,4,10,13] studies use simplified models, considering the torsion to be uncoupled to the remaining molecular degrees of freedom. This presumption has been questioned recently [5,14–16]: because molecular torsions are inherently coupled to the rotations of the molecule, the studies claim, torsional control is not adequately described by simplified models. Yet, the limitations of these studies [17] and the practical need for models of reduced dimensionality for describing the quantum dynamics of torsions make it necessary to reevaluate the conditions that have to be fulfilled for low-dimensional models to be good approximations.
The model that is mainly used in studies on laser-controlled molecular torsions relies on a two-step model: a linearly, circularly, or elliptically polarized laser pulse aligns the molecule adiabatically along its main principle axis and then a second femtosecond laser pulse with perpendicular polarization excites the molecular torsion selectively; see Fig. 1. If this mechanism was true, we would be able to simulate the control of molecular torsion considering only two degrees of freedom, the torsion angle ρ and the angle χ describing the rotation about the major principal axis. Several experimental studies underline the validity of this strongly idealized two-dimensional [2D] approach to torsional control [2,4,10,13], which has been the premise of many quantum dynamical simulations on strong field control [1–4,7–13,18]. Only recently, it was demonstrated experimentally that the torsion of a molecule can be controlled and enhanced by using two moderately strong, time-delayed, off-resonant laser pulses [10].
Some theoretical studies, however, pointed out that it may be impossible to control molecular torsions separately from the three rotational modes of the molecule [5,14–16]. Simulations of torsional control with a single non-resonant laser pulse within a four-dimensional [4D] quantum dynamical approach including all rotational degrees of freedom θ, ϕ, χ and the torsion angle ρ have shown the torsional alignment to be strongly depending on the overall rotation, in particular, as temperature increases [14]. Furthermore, they found the torsional alignment to be overestimated if simulated with the 2D approach [16]. These studies identified the coupling between rotational and torsional modes as the main reason for the potential uncontrollability of torsions [14,15].
In a very recent publication [17], we disputed these conclusions by simulating the two-step mechanism for torsional control, see Fig. 1, using a 4D approach. We were able to show for several examples that if the parameters of the two laser pulses are appropriately chosen, there are no considerable differences between the 2D and 4D descriptions of the two-step model. We even found that in certain cases, low-dimensional models underestimate the torsional alignment achieved by the two-pulse scenario, Fig. 1 [17]. Our simulations suggest that the validity of the 2D approach to torsional control depends on the molecule, in particular on the polarizability and the ratio of the rotational constants of the molecule.
Nevertheless, our insights into the mechanisms of torsional alignment do not allow for discarding the conclusions of earlier studies. Indeed, torsions and rotations are coupled, making it necessary to rethink the premises of low-dimensional models used to describe torsional control. In general, the torsion of a molecule cannot be manipulated independently of its rotational modes. To discuss the conditions that have to be met for the 2D model to be a good approximation, we here unfold our 4D approach to strong-field torsional control of molecules in the electronic ground state [17] in full detail.
We also identify three different types of rotational-torsional couplings, each having different origins and consequences. The various types of rotational-torsional couplings are in particular interesting because they directly compromise the picture quantum dynamical models conventionally convey: When employing the two-step model, Fig. 1, one usually anticipates that torsions and rotations can be adiabatically separated, and the slow rotations are frozen during the process of torsional control. We show hereafter how these assumptions need to be modified to consistently describe the process of aligning molecules with feasible torsion.
To illustrate our arguments, we focus on molecules consisting of two identical rotors with C_{2v}-symmetry; we call them G_{16}-type molecules, in conformity with their molecular symmetry [MS] group [19,20]. We demonstrate our approach for selected representatives of this class of molecules; their classical structures are depicted in Fig. 2. Using the symmetry-adapted variational method, quantum chemistry, and the adiabatic and sudden-approximation, we solve the time-dependent Schrödinger equation for all three rotations and the torsion of these molecules to simulate the control of the torsion according to the two-step mechanism from Fig. 1. Based on the knowledge we have acquired through our 4D simulations, we define the conditions the conventional 2D model has to fulfill to be a reliable approximation. For cases where this 2D model fails, we briefly discuss how the model can be modified to still account for the relevant effects. We are thus able to show here: Yes, if certain conditions for the properties of the studied molecules are met, low-dimensional models can successfully describe the strong-field control of torsions.
II. COUPLED AND CORRELATED: THREE REASONS WHY ROTATIONS AND TORSION ARE NOT INDEPENDENT FROM EACH OTHER
The main argument why torsional control of non-rigid molecules cannot be described with one- or two-dimensional models given in earlier studies is the (strong) coupling of the rotations with the torsion [14–16]. An analysis of the coupling, however, is missing in these studies; they do not give a systematic account of how and why torsional and rotational motions correlate.
We have identified three effects that make it impossible to assume the torsion to be independent from the rotations: the field-free and the field-induced coupling, on the one hand, and the symmetry-induced correlation, on the other hand. Each of these effects acts on the rotational-torsional motions in a different way; not all of them have negative consequences, as the term “coupling” might imply. Since they allow for a better understanding of the rotational-torsional quantum dynamics and they are the cornerstone of our further deliberations, we discuss the various effects in detail in Secs. II A–II D.
A. Field-free rotational-torsional couplings
A common approach to describing the field-free rotational-torsional motion of molecules with observable torsion in the electronic ground state is the internal-axis method [IAM]. Using this method, we are able to write the Hamiltonian for the rotational-torsional motion as [20,21]
where
denotes the Hamiltonian for the rotational motion and
is the Hamiltonian for the pure torsion; for G_{16}-type molecules, A=F. Within the IAM approach, the torsion angle ρ is defined as half of the dihedral angle; see Fig. 1. An incorrect definition of ρ as dihedral angle leads to a violation of energy invariance [22] and to incorrect symmetry properties of the torsional and rotational eigenfunctions [20,23].
In Eq. (1a), Ĵ_{Q}, Q = X, Y, Z [24] are the molecule-fixed angular momenta, A is the rotational constant with respect to the major principal axis and [19]
As the quantities B_{X^{2}±Y^{2}} are functions of the torsion angle ρ, the rotational motions and the torsion of G_{16}-type molecules are inherently coupled. In the following, we call this type of coupling the field-free rotational-torsional coupling. In Eqs. (2), we have introduced the reduced rotational constant
with B denoting the rotational constant for the D_{2d} structure of the molecules, i.e., for 2ρ=π2.
Conversely, the Hamiltonian for the pure torsion, Eq. (1b), does not depend on the rotational degrees of freedom. Besides the torsional constant F and the angular momentum for the torsion Ĵ_{ρ}, Ĥ^{tor} only contains the energy of the electronic ground state E0el(ρ) as a function of the torsion angle ρ, therefore being independent of the rotational coordinates θ, ϕ, χ.
The reduced rotational constant B_{red}, Eq. (3), gives us a quantitative measure for the field-free rotational-torsional coupling. If we scale the Hamiltonian Ĥ^{rt}, Eq. (1), with respect to B, the field-free coupling is determined by B_{red} alone. Expanding the functions B_{X^{2}±Y^{2}} from Eq. (2) in terms of a power series,
shows that the larger the B_{red}, the larger is the coupling between rotations and torsion. If B_{red}→0, we can write
Hence, in this approximation, the rotational constants are all independent of ρ, and the torsion and rotations of the molecule decouple. Then, Eq. (1a) reduces to
which is the rotational Hamiltonian of a symmetric top. This result implies that the asymmetry splitting, which is specific to asymmetric top molecules, vanishes for decoupled rotational and torsional motions as well, and within the limit B_{red}→0, G_{16}-type molecules can be treated as a symmetric top with decoupled torsion. How strongly the field-free coupling actually influences the quantum dynamics of non-rigid molecules therefore depends on the reduced rotational constant of the particular molecule.
B. Field-induced rotational-torsional couplings
In the scenario we envision here, two moderate intense laser pulses being off-resonant to any molecular transition are used to control the rotational-torsional motions of a molecule. As it was shown and validated in countless studies, the Hamiltonian for the interaction in this case is given by [25,26]
where q, q′ = x, y, z; ϵ_{q}(t) are the space-fixed components of the envelope of the laser field; and α_{qq^{′}} are the space-fixed components of the tensor of the dynamic polarizability. The components α_{qq^{′}} depend on the torsion angle ρ in a molecule-specific way.
When realizing the two-step strategy of torsional control, illustrated in Fig. 1, we assume the first laser field to be a laser pulse being long compared to the time scale of the rotational-torsional motions (adiabatic limit), while the second field is supposed to be a femtosecond laser pulse, i.e., short compared to the time scale of the rotational-torsional motions (impulsive limit). In both cases, we confine our discussion to linear-polarized laser fields. Then, the Hamiltonian Eq. (7) reduces to
where we choose q = z for pulse i = 1 and q = x for pulse i = 2, respectively. To quantify the effect of the laser pulses on the molecule, we express the laboratory-fixed components of the molecular polarizabilities
in terms of the elements of the Wigner D-matrices Dm,kJ [27] with the symmetric top quantum numbers J, m, and k, and the symmetry-adapted, molecule-fixed components of the polarizability tensor [20]α^{(0,0)}, α^{(2,0)}, and α^{(2,2)}; see Appendix A for a derivation.
The structure of Eqs. (8) shows us that through the interaction with the laser pulses, the rotations and the torsion of the molecule are coupled—the polarizabilities α^{(J,K)} are functions of the torsion angle ρ, while the Wigner D-matrices Dm,kJ depend on the Euler angles θ, ϕ, χ. Consequently, any laser pulse will, at least in principle, always excite both types of motions; rotational excitations are invariably accompanied by torsional excitations, and vice versa. This type of coupling we call field-induced coupling.
At this point, we can already give a qualitative discussion of the individual parts of Eqs. (8). First, if the ρ-dependence of α^{(0,0)} dominates the torsional excitation, torsion can be excited independently from the molecular rotation. Second, because the term D0,02 is responsible for the alignment of the main molecular axis, the molecule can be aligned without changing its torsional state only if the ρ-dependence of α^{(2,0)} is weak; if α^{(2,0)} strongly depends on ρ, alignment of the principal axis and torsional alignment cannot be separated. Finally, from the definition of α^{(2,2)}, see Eqs. (A2), we conclude that it couples the torsion and the rotation perpendicular to the major principal axis.
A large field-induced coupling, however, is not necessarily counterproductive for the control of molecular torsion. In our earlier studies based on the 2D model, the torsional and rotational motions were also coupled by the field [9], but we could not observe a “field-induced breakdown of the torsional alignment” as demonstrated in other studies [14–16]. As we show in Sec. IV, whether or not the field-induced coupling has negative effects is a matter of which excitation scheme we use, not a feature of torsional alignment in general.
C. Symmetry-induced correlations
We have identified a third effect that prevents an independent description of the torsion, which is less intuitive than the former two: the rotational and torsional states are not only coupled quantitatively through the ρ-dependence of molecular properties but they are also correlated by symmetry. As we do not study this effect systematically, we limit the following discussion on the aspect that is directly relevant for implementing our model by choosing a proper basis set.
This facet of the symmetry-induced correlation originates from the transformation properties of χ and ρ. As theoretical spectroscopists have discussed in great detail [19,20,23,28], the angles χ and ρ are “double-valued” within an IAM treatment. As a consequence, the torsional and rotational basis functions have to be classified according to the irreducible representations of an extended molecular symmetry (EMS) group, see in particular the book of Bunker and Jensen [20] pp. 515 for a detailed explanation. The EMS group of molecules with feasible torsion consisting of two identical rotors with C_{2v}-symmetry is G_{16}(EM) and was first investigated by Merer and Watson [19].
To illustrate why using an EMS-group leads to a symmetry-induced correlation, we consider an arbitrary rotational-torsional state. This state we can always expand into products of symmetry-adapted rotational and torsional basis functions, which have to transform according to the irreducible representations of G_{16}(EM) [19]. One feature of EMS groups is that their irreducible representations Γ can be grouped into single-valued and double-valued representations. The combined rotational-torsional states must transform according to a single-valued irreducible representation [20]. Since
the irreducible representations of the torsional and rotational basis states must be therefore either both single-valued or both double-valued [19,20]. Here, Γ^{rot}, Γ^{tor}, and Γ^{rt} refer to the irreducible representations of the rotational, torsional, and rotational-torsional states. Thus, for Γ^{rt} to be single-valued, the symmetries of the torsional and rotational states are symmetry-correlated. We exemplify this correlation in Sec. III B, where we discuss the basis set we have used in our calculations.
Like the two types of rotational-torsional coupling, the symmetry-induced correlation prevents us from modeling the control of the torsion as being independent of the rotations of G_{16}-type molecules. Although we do not systematically study the symmetry-induced correlation in this publication, we stress that most studies on torsional alignment ignore this effect [2–4,8–10,13], and therefore, their conclusions need to be reevaluated.
D. Rotational-torsional couplings and the two-dimensional model
The 2D model that has been mainly used to describe the rotational-torsional motions molecules during the last decades [1–4,7–13,29,30] premises the molecules to be perfectly aligned along their axis of torsion. Consequently, if we use this model, we presuppose that the first step of the two-step mechanism illustrated in Fig. 1 was realized successfully.
If the molecule-fixed e_{Z}-axis is parallel or anti-parallel to the space-fixed e_{z}-axis, and therefore to the polarization vector of the first laser pulse, θ=0,π. Then, the angle ϕ is redundant, and we can choose ϕ = 0. Calculating the limit θ → 0 and ϕ → 0 in Eqs. (1), we obtain the field-free Hamiltonian for the remaining two coordinates, χ and ρ,
The eigenfunctions of Ĥ^{2D} can be written as
where the rotational eigenfunctions are
and the eigenfunctions of the pure torsional Hamiltonian, Φn_{ρ}tor(ρ), we expand according to
with
As the rotational constant A in Eq. (10) is independent of ρ, and Ĥ^{2D} contains no explicit cross terms, no field-free coupling arises when employing 2D model.
Analogously, by setting θ = 0 and ϕ = 0 in Eqs. (8), we obtain for the interaction of the molecule with the second laser pulse
see also Appendix A. Due to the last term on the right-hand side of Eq. (12), in the 2D model, rotations and torsions are coupled by the field. Thus, contrary to the field-free rotational-torsional coupling, the field-induced coupling occurs as well in the 2D treatment of torsional control.
Likewise, the correlation of the torsional and rotational symmetries is also present in the 2D model: as the symmetry-induced correlation originates from the transformation properties of the angles χ and ρ, the rotational and torsional symmetries are still correlated [22].
In summary, effects that prevent us to consider torsion and rotations as being independent from each other are also present when we use the 2D model to describe the torsional control of non-rigid molecules. Only the field-free coupling is vanishing if the molecules are assumed to be perfectly aligned along their major principal axes. We study the influence of the rotational-torsional coupling in detail in Sec. IV. Yet, we can already conclude from the comparison of the 4D and 2D model that “the rotational-torsional coupling” cannot be the only reason for a potential disagreement of both descriptions, as certain types of couplings are considered in both models.
III. A NUMERICAL APPROACH TO FOUR-DIMENSIONAL TORSIONAL CONTROL
To simulate the two-step mechanism of torsional control illustrated in Fig. 1, we numerically solve the time-dependent Schrödinger equation by transforming it into a matrix problem, using an expansion into energy-eigenfunctions. To minimize the drawbacks of this ansatz, we make use of symmetry arguments, thus characterizing our method as a symmetry-adapted variational approach to torsional control. We illustrate this strategy in Fig. 3.
Using group theory, we derive the symmetry-adapted form of the matrix representations for the field-free and field-matter Hamiltonians. We obtain the required molecular parameters with quantum chemistry and use a symmetry-adapted fitting procedure to implement the data in our numerical code. To solve the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, we use two different approximations, the adiabatic and the sudden approximation. Physically, they reflect the two limiting cases of molecular alignment we are considering here, the adiabatic [26,31] and impulsive [25] regime. In both cases, we transform the time-dependent Schrödinger equation into a symmetry-adapted matrix problem and calculate their solutions by diagonalizing the matrix representation of the respective Hamiltonian. Finally, we determine and compare the relevant expectation values, namely, the alignment factor ⟨cos^{2}θ⟩ and the torsional alignment factor ⟨cos^{2} 2ρ⟩ in the 4D model and the torsional alignment factor in the 2D model. For technical details of our numerical code; see Appendix B. A critique of our approach we develop in Sec. V.
A. Adiabatic and non-adiabatic alignment as two limiting cases of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation
When the molecules are interacting with the first, off-resonant, moderately intense laser pulse, pendular states are created by the field [31]. If the envelope of the laser pulse varies sufficiently slowly compared to the rotational-torsional motion of the molecule, we can assume the molecular eigenstates to be adiabatically evolving into the pendular states, using the adiabatic theorem of quantum mechanics [32]. Then, we can approximate ϵ_{1}(t)≈ϵ1max during the pulse and, as a consequence, the Hamiltonian for the molecule interacting with the first laser pulse
is time-independent, see Eqs. (1)–(1b) and (8)–(8b) for the definition of Ĥ^{rt} and Ĥ1int, respectively. This allows us to find the pendular states Φn_{fd}fd and the corresponding field-dressed energies En_{fd}fd from solving the eigenvalue equation
For the molecules we consider here, the condition to be “long” is fulfilled by nanosecond laser pulses. In general, however, the pulse might have to be longer, depending on the size and mass of the molecule.
Numerically, we calculate Φn_{fd}fd and En_{fd}fd by expanding Φn_{fd}fd into a symmetry-adapted basis; see Sec. III B and Appendix B for a more elaborate outline. We find the expansion coefficients for the basis functions from diagonalizing the matrix H^{rt}+H1int.
Once the molecules have adiabatically evolved into a pendular state, a second, off-resonant, femtosecond laser pulse is applied to the system. Thus, wave packets composed of pendular states are created by the field
with t_{0^{+}} denoting the time at the end of the pulse, and t≥t_{0^{+}}.
To obtain the coefficients c_{nfd}(t_{0^{+}}), we make use of the sudden approximation [33,34] and write the wave function at the end of the second laser pulse as
where Ψ(t_{0^{−}}) denotes the wave function of the system before interacting with the laser pulse, and Ĥ2int is defined in Eqs. (8) and (8b). We obtain the coefficients in Eq. (15) by expanding Ψ(t_{0^{+}}) in terms of symmetry-adapted basis functions; see Sec. III B and Appendix B for details. Then, solving Eq. (16) is equivalent to finding the solution of the matrix equation
where the column-vectors c(t_{0^{±}}) contain the expansion coefficients of the wave packets from Eq. (15); α_{xx} is the matrix representation of Eq. (8b) in the symmetry-adapted basis; and
is the integrated electric field strength. As ϵ22¯ is integrated over time, the pulse shape plays no role when the sudden-approximation is used to describe impulsive alignment. In our calculations, we assumed throughout a Gaussian-like laser pulse.
The observables we are interested in are the alignment factors. The alignment along the major principal axis of the molecules is characterized by the expectation value
where
If A_{θ} is one, all molecules are aligned along the field axis E_{1}; if A_{θ} is zero, all molecules in the probe are aligned perpendicular to the field E_{1}; isotropic angular distribution corresponds to A_{θ}=13; see also Fig. 1 for a graphical illustration of A_{θ}.
Whether or not the control of the torsional degree of freedom by the laser fields is successful, we can learn from the torsional alignment factor
where, again,
In case the dihedral angle γ = 2ρ is 90° for all molecules in the probe, A_{2ρ} = 0; if γ is 0° for all molecules, A_{2ρ} = 1; the equilibrium value of A_{2ρ} is determined by the shape of the torsional potential E0tor(ρ); for a classical illustration of A_{2ρ} see Fig. 1.
The time-evolution of the expectation values A_{θ} and A_{ρ} is the basis of our analysis of what the conditions are for the 2D model to be a reliable approximation. In Sec. IV, we present our results of the simulations for A_{θ} and A_{ρ} for different molecules, see Fig. 2, and laser pulse intensities.
B. The symmetry-adapted variational method
To solve Eqs. (14) and (17) numerically, we expand the pendular states Φ^{fd} in terms of symmetry-adapted products of rotational and torsional basis functions.
For the rotations, the symmetry-adapted basis functions are Wang-functions [35]
where Φ_{J,±K,m} denote the symmetric top eigenfunctions from Eq. (22a). For k = 0 holds
Here,
are the rotational eigenfunctions of a symmetric top as a function of the Euler angles θ, ϕ, χ [27].
On the other hand, the symmetry-adapted basis for the torsion is given by
for K_{ρ} = |k_{ρ}| ≠ 0 and Φ0+≡12π for k_{ρ} = 0. The function Eqs. (21) and (23) transform irreducible in the group G_{16}(EM); their irreducible representations Γ^{rot} and Γ^{tor} are shown in Table IV in the work of Merer and Watson [19], which we also provide in the supplementary material.
If written in the symmetry-adapted basis, the matrix representation H of any Hamiltonian we consider here decomposes into blocks according to the symmetries Γ^{rt} = Γ^{tor} ⊗ Γ^{rot} of the rotational-torsional states [36], which substantially reduces the numerical effort of diagonalizing the Hamiltonian. Numerically, a convenient way to transform H to the symmetry-adapted basis is to use special projection operators [36]; see Appendix B for our implementation.
As we pointed out in Sec. II C, only those products of rotational and torsional basis functions are symmetry-allowed for which Γ^{rt} is single-valued [20]. The combinations of basis functions that fulfill this condition are summarized in Table IV in the work of Merer and Watson [19]. Hence, only rotational and torsional basis states are compatible of which both quantum numbers K and K_{ρ} are either even or odd, reflecting the symmetry-induced correlation of rotations and torsions. In the following, we assume the molecules to be initially in their rotational-torsional ground state, having A1g+-symmetry. This is equivalent to treating molecules at temperature T = 0 K.
C. Getting the molecular parameters: Quantum chemistry
The Hamiltonians for the field-free rotational-torsional motions, Eqs. (1) and for the field-matter interaction, Eqs. (8), both depend on parameters being characteristic for each molecule: the rotational constants A and B; the torsional constant F and the torsional potential E^{el} as a function of the torsion angle ρ; and the components of the polarizability tensor α_{qq}, also being a function of ρ. To obtain all relevant quantities, we performed quantum chemical calculations using Density Functional Theory (DFT) with B3LYP as correlation-exchange functional and an aug-cc-pVTZ basis set with QChem [37].
We obtained the rotational constants A and B from a geometry optimization. We either optimized the planar structure, having D_{2h} point-group symmetry, or the orthogonal structure with D_{2d} point-group symmetry, depending on which of the configurations is lower in energy for the respective molecule. Table I shows the results for the molecules shown in Fig. 2. There, we also display the reduced rotational constant B_{red}, c.f. (3): Clearly, for most of the molecules, B_{red} is small; with the exception of 9-[2-(anthracen-9-yl)ethynyl]anthracene (AAC) and B_{2}F_{4}, the conditions Eqs. (5) are reasonable approximations. Hence, the results from Table I suggest that the influence of the field-free coupling is small and therefore has only little influence on the success of torsional alignment, as we shall also see in Sec. IV.
To calculate the torsional potential and the components of the polarizability tensor, we performed a potential scan by varying the torsional angle ρ in increments of 5° without allowing the other internal coordinates to relax. As a reference structure, we used either the D_{2d} or D_{2h} configuration; see Table I. Analogously, we calculated the components of the polarizability tensor by varying the torsional angle ρ in increments of 5°. We would like to stress that a scan with allowing the structure of the molecules to relax has lead to only small corrections of both the polarizabilities and the torsional potential, which can be therefore neglected for simulating the time scales we consider here.
To implement the quantum chemical results for E^{el}(ρ) and α_{qq}(ρ), we interpolate the data and expand them in terms of analytical functions. The details of this procedure we describe in Subsections III D and III E.
D. Symmetry-adapted torsional potentials
As it allows us to calculate the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian Ĥ^{rt} analytically, we expand the torsional potential in terms of a Fourier series
The symmetry of the field-free rotational-torsional Hamiltonian limits the number of non-zero coefficients in the expansion Eq. (24). As Ĥ^{rt} is invariant in G_{16}(EM), the torsional potential must transform according to the total symmetric representation A1g+. The only functions fulfilling this conditions are cos(4nρ)∼A1g+; all remaining terms in Eq. (24) are necessarily vanishing.
Hence, we can expand the torsional potential according to
where V0tor denotes the torsional potential for ρ = 0. We obtained the expansion coefficients V_{n} in Eq. (25) by numerical integration, after interpolating our quantum chemical data using the spline function of MatLab. We can adequately reproduce our quantum chemical data if we set N = 6. For a complete list of the expansion coefficients; see Table II. The quantity
illustrates the electronic energy difference the molecules undergo during the torsion.
For further details, in particular, the explicit form of the matrix elements of Ĥ^{tor}; see Appendix B.
E. A symmetry-adapted interaction Hamiltonian
Analogously to the torsional potential, we can use molecular symmetry to find an adequate numerical representation of our quantum chemical results for the molecular polarizability. The Hamiltonian Eq. (7) has to transform according to the total symmetric representation Γ_{ts} in the (E)MS group of the molecule under consideration [20,38,39]. This allows us to draw some general conclusions about the symmetry conditions for each term in Eqs. (8a) and (8b). Particularly, it holds
where Γ_{ts} denotes the total symmetric representation of the (E)MS group of the molecule, and Γ̆ is the contragredient representation of Γ. Here, we used the general theorem that the direct product of two irreducible representations Γ_{i}, Γ_{j} of any given group contains the total symmetric representation only if Γ_{i}=Γ̆{j}=Γj−1{T} [40]. Furthermore, it holds
which follows directly from the transformation properties of the Wigner matrices in the MS group [20].
For G_{16}-type molecules, we can show with the help of the character table displayed in Table IV in the work of Merer and Watson [19]
Consequently, for the molecule-fixed, irreducible components of α must hold
for Ĥiint,i=1,2 to be invariant in G_{16}(EM). Here, we have used that all irreducible representations of G_{16}(EM) are either identical or equivalent to their contragredient representation.
Thus, for G_{16}-type molecules, the quantum chemical results for the polarizability have to be written as
since cos(4nρ)∼A1g+ and cos((4n+2)ρ)∼B1g+ if n is integer. In Eq. (30), α^{(J,k)}(ρ=0)≡α0(J,K) with J = 0, 2 and K = 0, 2, respectively. Furthermore, our quantum chemical results show that in good approximation for all molecules we are studying here, we can truncate the expansion Eq. (30) at N = 2. All relevant parameters we need to calculate the polarizabilities are summarized in Table III. Using the model for the interaction we developed here, we are able to consistently describe the alignment of G_{16}-type molecules.
F. Additive and non-additive models for the molecular polarizability
In many studies on torsional control, a simplified model for the interaction was used, which is based on the additivity scheme of molecular properties [1,3,8,9,11,12,14–16]. If we employ the additive model, we assume the polarizability of the molecule to be a sum of the polarizabilities of molecular subunits [41]. This scheme is equivalent to taking into account only the leading terms (n = 0) of the expansions Eq. (30). Consequently, the additive model is a good approximation if the Fourier series for the polarizabilities α^{(J,K)} are converging reasonably fast. From this, it also follows that the field-induced rotational-torsional coupling is minimized if the additive model is applied. Then, only one term of the polarizabilities depends on ρ, limiting the possible excitations due to the external fields.
As Table III shows, some molecules we are considering here meet the conditions prescribed by the additive model. The component α^{(2,2)} of B_{2}F_{4}, for example, can be written in very good approximation as
while the change of the other two components, compared to the change in α^{(2,2)}, is negligible and they can be therefore considered to be constant. For the other molecules, however, the torsional dependence of α^{(0,0)} and α^{(2,0)} needs to be taken into account. As a general trend, one might say, the more polarizable the molecules are, the worse the additive model is.
IV. ON THE TWO-STEP MODEL
Recently, we have presented some of our main results on the systematic comparison of the 4D model with the conventional 2D approach to torsional control [17]. In the following, we cast a more detailed glance on our findings. Not only we give more examples that underline our recently published interpretations but also argue why the broad conclusions of earlier studies [14–16] are limited. To address the critique raised in these studies, we systematically study the influence of the field-free and field-induced rotational-torsional coupling on the rotational-torsional alignment. Moreover, we discuss in detail the conditions for the 2D model to be a reasonable approximation to a 4D description, and we illustrate why the theoretical description of the polarizability is closely related to answering this question. We therefore provide the theoretical basis why in certain cases we have to extend the conventional 2D model. We close this section with a detailed theoretical analysis of our results in order to underscore why our conclusions are general.
A. General results from specific examples? Our approach
But how can we draw general conclusions at all? The greatest challenge in molecular physics is the complexity of molecules, making every one of them a specific example and formulating general rules that apply to every molecule difficult, if not impossible. Limiting the theoretical framework to the closed-system semi-rigid-rotor approach, we are able to fully characterize different molecules by a small set of numbers: the rotational constants A,B, the torsional potential E0el(ρ), and the components of the molecular polarizability α^{(J,K)}; see Tables I–III, respectively. However, using this rather simple approach, we ignore a number of phenomena that may have an impact on torsional control, which we discuss in Sec. V.
To directly compare the molecules, we adjust the torsional barrier and the field strength for each molecule to a reference system, which we choose to be B_{2}F_{4}. For all remaining molecules from Fig. 2, we scale the effective torsional barrier
such that it is identical with the effective barrier of B_{2}F_{4}. Accordingly, we adapt the intensities I_{i}=|ϵimax|^{2}2μ_{0}c with i = 1, 2 so that for every molecule the effective pulse strength
for the nanosecond pulse E_{1} and
for the femtosecond pulse E_{2} are identical. We pursued a similar strategy in earlier studies [9,39,42].
We stress, however, that in contrast to rigid symmetric tops and linear molecules, it is not possible to define a dimensionless form of the Schrödinger equation that is identical for all molecules. The explicit shape of the torsional potential E0el(ρ), Eq. (25), the coordinate dependence of the polarizabilities α^{(J,K)}, Eq. (30), and the ratio of the rotational constants A and B are different for all molecules we consider here. Yet, we still can identify fundamental mechanisms that are decisive for answering the question whether the 2D model is a good approximation to the 4D approach to torsional control. In this section, we limit our discussion to some illustrative results; in the supplementary material, we provide more examples that strengthen the arguments we present in the following.
B. Torsional alignment in four dimensions: A second look
As a first example, we discuss the rotational-torsional alignment of biphenyl. In Fig. 4, we show the rotational (lower panel) and the torsional (upper panel) alignment factors, A_{θ} = ⟨cos^{2}θ⟩ and A_{2ρ} = ⟨cos^{2} 2ρ⟩, from 4D calculations for three different adiabatic pulse strengths, I_{1}=0GWcm{2} (blue lines), I_{1}=59.5GWcm{2} (green lines), I_{1}=297.5GWcm{2} (red lines), respectively, and for a femtosecond laser pulse with intensity I_{2}=5.4TWcm{2}. We compare them with 2D calculations for I_{2}=5.4TWcm{2}, which are depicted by black dotted lines.
The best agreement between the 2D and 4D simulations we obtain for moderate adiabatic pulse strengths (green line in the upper panel of Fig. 4). Here, the 2D model almost completely reproduces the torsional alignment A_{2ρ} obtained from 4D calculations. We can also see that the variation of A_{2ρ} is reduced if no adiabatic field is applied (blue line in the upper panel of Fig. 4), and thus, no attempt is made to align the molecules along their major principal axis. If, on the other hand, the intensity of the adiabatic pulse is very high (red line in the upper panel of Fig. 4), the agreement between 2D model and 4D is again less pronounced than for an adiabatic pulse with moderate intensity, a result that we have also observed for B_{2}F_{4} [17]. We find it important to note, however, that the change in A_{2ρ} due to the interaction with the laser pulses is highest for the strongest adiabatic pulse. Here, the 2D model underestimates the degree of torsional alignment. Contrary to earlier studies [16], we therefore conclude that less congruence between 2D and 4D simulations does not necessarily correspond to a worse alignment within the 4D model.
As we consider biphenyl, one of the most intensively studied molecules when it comes to strong field control of torsions, we should comment more extensively on some of the differences of our study compared to earlier studies [9,11,12,14–16]. These disparities derive in parts from different quantum chemical results on the torsional potential, a different definition of the torsional constant, and a different description of the molecular polarizabilities. To describe the molecular polarizabilities, for example, all of the cited studies use the additive model, leading to very different degrees of torsional excitation, as we discuss in Sec. IV D. Further, the shape of the torsional potential can substantially differ if different quantum chemical methods with different basis sets are employed [11,12]. Hence, to compare our studies to earlier studies, these differences in methodology have to be taken into account.
For the rotational motion, our results show that the adiabatic pulse effectively aligns the molecules along their principal axis; see green and red lines in the lower panel of Fig. 4. Even for moderate field intensities (green line), the molecules show very good alignment. Moreover, we see that the rotational alignment factors change only little in time, irrespective of the pulse strength. Thus, the rotational motion perpendicular to the major principal axis occurs on a time scale that is significantly longer than the time scale on which the torsional dynamics takes place.
Consequently, in the case of biphenyl, we observe the same behavior we have seen earlier for B_{2}F_{4}; see Fig. 2 in Ref [17]. For moderate adiabatic pulses, the presumption of the two-step mechanism illustrated in Fig. 1 is acceptable: the first laser pulse effectively controls the rotation, before the femtosecond laser pulse selectively excites the torsional motion of the molecule. We have found similar results for almost all molecules from Fig. 2; an exception is 6,6′-Biazunlenyle (Biazu), as we shall see in Sec. IV D.
C. How important are field-free rotational-torsional couplings?
In the following, we examine in more detail the argument that rotational-torsional couplings are the reason why in previous studies [14–16] the torsional alignment has been seen to be reduced in 4D simulations when compared to 2D simulations. Here, we unravel the influence of the field-free coupling on the rotational and torsional alignment of the molecules from Fig. 2. Researching this type of coupling is crucial as it is inherent to the molecule. Being completely determined by the reduced rotational constant, it cannot be controlled or even modified by the external laser field. To quantify the impact of the field-free rotational-torsional coupling, we have run simulations applying the conditions Eqs. (5) in order to eliminate the coupling and compared them to simulations including the full coupling.
Consider AAC as a first example. Among the molecules we have studied, it has one of the largest reduced rotational constants (B_{red}=0.19; see Table I), which is why we expect the influence of the field-free coupling on the rotational-torsional alignment to be most distinct. Figure 5 shows the rotational (lower panel) and the torsional (upper panel) alignment factors, A_{θ} and A_{2ρ}, for three different adiabatic pulse strengths, I_{1}=0GWcm{2} (blue lines), I_{1}=0.9GWcm{2} (green lines), I_{1}=4.5GWcm{2} (red lines), respectively, and for a femtosecond laser pulse with intensity I_{2}=1.04TWcm{2}. Calculations including the field-free coupling are depicted by solid lines; calculations without field-free coupling correspond to dashed lines. Clearly, the field-free coupling has only a little influence on the alignment, in particular, on the torsional alignment factor. For the rotations, simulations with and without the field-free rotational-torsional coupling differ more. Here, the influence of the field-free coupling is most distinct for adiabatic pulses with high intensity (red lines), while for the torsion, the field-free coupling is visible the most in case no adiabatic pulse is applied (blue lines). For rotations, the influence of the coupling is negative, i.e., it reduces the alignment factor A_{θ} compared to simulations neglecting the coupling. Moreover, we see that the effect of the field-free coupling on the rotational-torsional alignment becomes more influential as time evolves. This effect was also observed for other types of couplings [12,43,44]. For B_{2}F_{4}, which has a comparable rotational constant, we have obtained similar results as for AAC; see Ref [17].
For biphenyl, we observe an even less pronounced effect; compare dashed and solid lines in Fig. 4. Due to the very small reduced rotational constant of biphenyl (B_{red}=0.087, see Table I), the field-free coupling has almost no influence on the alignment factors for rotations and torsion alike. The same effect we have seen for 4,4′-Dibromobiphenyl (DBBP), see Fig. 3 in Ref [17], and we can also observe it for other molecules; see the supplementary material. Thus, while the field-free coupling has indeed a negative effect on the rotational alignment, the effect is rather small, even for molecules with large B_{red}.
D. The crucial role of field-induced couplings: The additive model and torsional alignment
The prima facie presumption is therefore that the disagreement between 2D and 4D simulations, if it occurs, is a result of the field-induced coupling. As we explain in Secs. II B and III F, this type of rotational-torsional coupling is directly related to the polarizability of the molecule, and if we use the additive model instead of the full quantum chemical model to describe the molecular polarizabilities, we account for the field-induced coupling only in a minimalist manner. In what follows, we compare the impact that both models have on the rotational-torsional alignment. We discuss Biazu as an example. Table III, line 4 shows us that for this molecule, in particular, the additive model is a bad approximation. We therefore expect the effect of the field-induced coupling to be most visible.
First, we consider the scenario where no adiabatic pulse is applied and the intensity of the femtosecond pulse is I_{2}=3.42TWcm{2}. The upper panel of Fig. 6 displays the torsional alignment obtained from 4D (solid brown line) and 2D (dotted brown line) simulations employing the additive model and compares them to 4D calculations with the full form of the polarizabilities (blue line). We observe that the torsional alignment factor obtained from 4D simulations with additive model and the full form of the polarizabilities differ: here, the additive model slightly underestimates the degree of torsional alignment. Moreover, the 2D simulations with the full form of the polarizability almost coincide with the corresponding 4D simulations, an exception to the results from other molecules, as mentioned in Sec. IV B. This is at first glance surprising since the 2D model assumes perfectly aligned molecules, while in the 4D simulations, the angular distribution of the molecules is isotropic. We attribute this effect to the strong ρ-dependence of the term α^{(0,0)}, see line 4 in Table III, since this term leads to an excitation of the torsion independently from the rotational state of the molecules; see Eqs. (8a) and (8b).
Comparing the 2D (brown dotted line) and 4D (brown line) simulations based on the additive model, we also learn that the 2D simulations slightly overestimate the degree of torsional alignment. Thus, if the additive model is employed and the field-induced coupling is minimized, the torsional alignment is underestimated indeed. These results support the argument of earlier studies [14–16], which considered exactly this case. Yet, we also observe that the 2D (black dotted line) and the 4D simulations (blue line) are in better agreement if we use quantum chemical polarizabilities. Then, the degree the 2D model overestimates the results from 4D calculations is even less pronounced.
However, the picture changes if we turn to the case in which the molecule interacts with a nanosecond pulse while a short pulse excites a rotational-torsional wavepacket. In Fig. 6, lower panel, we show our results for I_{1}=85GWcm{2} and I_{2}=3.42TWcm{2}. Considering 4D simulations using the full form of the polarizabilities (red line) and comparing them with respective simulations without applying an adiabatic pulse (blue line in the upper panel of Fig. 6), the torsional alignment factor is already increased at t = 0. In this case, the pendular state created by the nanosecond pulse contains not only excited rotational states; the first and second excited torsional states are also populated, as it can be seen in the upper panel of Fig. 7. The adiabatic excitation of torsional states is a result of the strong ρ-dependence of the polarizabilities, in particular, of the terms α^{(0,0)} and α^{(2,0)}; see line 4 in Table III. Thus, continuing our discussion from Sec. II B, aligning Biazu adiabatically with a strong nanosecond laser pulse represents a case where the ρ-dependence of α^{(2,0)} is so strong that the molecule cannot be aligned without substantially exciting torsional states. An analog effect of adiabatic torsional alignment, we also observed for AAC, see Fig. 5, and DBBP see Fig. 4 in Ref [17].
When employing the additive model, which neglects the ρ-dependence of α^{(2,0)}, no excited torsional states contribute to the pendular state, see lower panel of Fig. 7, and thus no adiabatic torsional alignment occurs, as it can be seen from the brown line in Fig. 6, right panel. Notably, if we apply the additive model and therefore describe the field-induced coupling only rudimentary, the 2D model (brown dotted lines in Fig. 6) does not overestimate, but it underestimates the degree of torsional alignment. Hence, contrary to earlier findings [16], 2D calculations using the additive model underestimate the degree of torsional alignment in certain cases.
Based on our results, we can moreover relate the validity of the 2D model and the additive model. Using the 2D model, we assume that the molecules are perfectly aligned without exciting any torsional states. This assumption is only valid if the ρ-dependence of α^{(2,0)} can be neglected, as it is done within the additive model. If we apply the additive model, 2D and 4D simulations agree very well; see left and middle panels of Fig. 6. This coincidence of 2D and 4D simulations based on the additive model we observe for all molecules we have studied; see the supplementary material and Fig. 4 in Ref [17]. Consequently, if the additive model is a good approximation to the molecular polarizabilities, the 2D model reproduces the torsional alignment obtained from a 4D calculation. By tendency, the more pronounced this correlation is, the more intense the adiabatic laser pulse is.
Summarizing Secs. IV B–IV D, we identify four main results giving some indication about the nature of the rotational-torsional couplings: (1) the dominant coupling effect is the field-induced rotational-torsional coupling; (2) the effects originating from the field-induced coupling are not necessarily negative, but they rather assist the torsional alignment; (3) if the field-induced coupling is minimized, e.g., by employing the additive model, good, if not excellent agreement between 2D and 4D model is expected; and (4) if the additive model fails because of a strong ρ-dependence of the polarizabilities, additional effects occur, namely, adiabatic torsional alignment during the adiabatic pulse.
E. Couplings as numerical artifacts? On convergence
In earlier studies on four-dimensional rotational-torsional alignment, basis sets with only J^{max} = 10 were used [14–16]. Hence, to fully understand why, in parts, our simulations are so different from these studies, we compare the alignment factors obtained from simulations using basis set sizes. By doing so, we might also learn which physical effects are improperly described, and how the observables of interest are affected, if no convergence is obtained.
Using the example of B_{2}F_{4}, Fig. 8 shows calculations for different basis set sizes, including (solid lines) and excluding (dashed lines) the field-free rotational-torsional coupling. In all calculations, I_{1}=5TWcm{2} and I_{2}=50TWcm{2}; red lines represent converged calculations, i.e., J^{max} = 20 and Kρmax=250, purple lines correspond to calculations with J^{max} = 10 and Kρmax=50.
What we can observe here is a distinct correlation between the basis set size and the degree of the rotational-torsional alignment: the larger the basis set size, the less the degree of alignment is reduced as time evolves. Consequently, the degree of alignment is underestimated if the basis set is too small. The effect is more dominant for the rotations than for the torsion. We can understand this result if we recall that pendular states corresponding to a high degree of alignment in θ are very narrow in the angular space, thus requiring a large number of field-free energy eigenstates for an adequate numerical representation. Hence, if we wish to describe a molecule that is highly aligned along its molecular axis, we need a large rotational-torsional basis.
Moreover, for small basis sets, the results from simulations including the field-free coupling are indistinguishable from those neglecting the coupling; see purple lines in Fig. 8: the small energy splittings due to field-free rotational-torsional coupling cannot be resolved with a small basis set. Hence, in earlier studies on the four-dimensional rotational-torsional alignment, which used basis sets with J^{max} = 10 [14–16], the field-free coupling is not adequately described. Very recent studies on the rotational-torsional alignment of biphenyl-like systems in electronically excited states confirm these conclusions [5].
Our results also show how unreliable the simulations generally become if we choose a small, yet numerically feasible basis set size. In all of our calculations, we had to use large basis sets with at least J^{max} = 20 and Kρmax=250 to obtain converged results. Our calculations therefore took rather long and, more importantly, had a high demand in memory. Truly converged results we only obtained for B_{2}F_{4}; for all remaining molecules, we were still able to observe slight changes in the alignment when enlarging the basis set. To treat molecules like DBBP, AAC, biphenyl, and Biazu with unscaled torsional barrier reliably, a four-dimensional quantum description using our implementation might be numerically unfeasible. If no other approaches, such as the multi-configurational time-dependent Hartree method (MCTDH) or semi-classical methods, are used to simulate the torsional alignment of these systems, we need to develop alternative strategies in order to reduce dimensionality and hence the numerical effort. Taking into account that most of the systems being studied to date are of lower symmetry, advancing such strategies becomes even more important. In case the molecule has a smaller symmetry group, more basis states can be coupled by the field, and thus, larger basis sets are required to describe the pendular states of a given symmetry accurately.
F. Why the conventional two-dimensional model fails
After having discussed our results in detail, we analyze the underlying mechanisms making the 2D model a good or bad approximation to the 4D model. We first reflect the implicit presuppositions the conventional 2D model makes. One premise is that the molecule under consideration is perfectly aligned along its axis of torsion. What remains are the two coordinates χ and ρ, the rotation about the major principal axis and the torsion of the two molecular moieties.
The second assumption is that neither the torsion nor the rotation about the e_{Z}-axis is excited during the process of alignment: It is usually assumed that the initial state of the molecules is adequately represented by the ground state of the 2D field-free Hamiltonian, Ĥ^{2D}, c.f. Eq. (10) [1,3,8,9,11,12,30,45,46]. For this assumption to be right, the rotational projection quantum numbers k and m, as well as the torsional quantum number n_{ρ}, need to be conserved during the process of alignment.
The third assumption is what we call the frozen mode approximation. When employing the conventional 2D model, it is anticipated that during the process of torsional control, the rotations perpendicular to the torsional axis can be considered to be fixed rather than adiabatically separated. Within this picture, the torsion ρ and the rotation χ perpendicular to the major principal axis are too fast for the modes described by θ and ϕ to adapt to new configurations in ρ and χ. Only if this assumption is reasonable, it is legitimate to ignore motions along θ and ϕ.
In the following, we discuss the three assumptions—perfect alignment along the major principal axis, conservation of the quantum numbers k, m, n_{ρ}, and the frozen mode approximation—separately. The first assumption, our results confirm, is reasonable: in all of our simulations, we observe that it is possible to align the molecules adiabatically with moderate intense laser pulses reasonably well, see Figs. 4 and 5 in this section, the supplementary material, and Figs. 2 and 3 in Ref [17].
The second assumption, namely, the condition that no torsion or rotation about the axis of torsion is excited by the first laser pulse, is, however, dubious [5]. The field-free and the field-induced coupling both prevent the quantum numbers k and n_{ρ} to be conserved during the process of adiabatic alignment. To illustrate why, we begin with recasting Eq. (1) according to
where
and Ĥ^{2D} is defined in Eq. (10). In Eq. (34a), we used the identity
and we introduced the molecule-fixed raising and lowering operators
Consequently, whereas the operator Ĥ^{2D} is independent of the Eulerian angles ϕ and θ, the operator Ĥρred depends on all four coordinates θ, ϕ, χ, and ρ and thus leads to excitations in all degrees of freedom.
To quantify this effect, we recall the results of the discussion from Sec. II A: the smaller the reduced rotational constant B_{red}, c.f. Eq. (3), the less the rotations and the torsion are coupled in the field-free case. As the 2D model relies on this decoupling, the assumption that the torsional state n_{ρ} is retained during the alignment of the major principal axis is therefore, too, the better, the smaller B_{red}.
For the rotational quantum numbers m and k to be conserved, the operator Ĥρred must commute with the angular momentum operators Ĵ_{z} and Ĵ_{Z}. While this holds true for the space-fixed z-component of the angular momentum Ĵ, the molecule-fixed component Ĵ_{Z} does not commute with Ĥρred due to the second term on the right-hand side of Eq. (34a). Thus, m is a conserved quantum number, but k is not; the raising- and lowering operators Ĵ_{±} increase or decrease the value of k by 2. For rigid molecules, this effect is known as asymmetry-splitting. What we can again learn from the discussion in Sec. II A is that for G_{16}-type molecules, the asymmetry-splitting and the reduced rotational constant B_{red} are also intertwined: the smaller B_{red}, the smaller the asymmetry-splitting. Thus, how the field-free coupling and the validity of the 2D model correlate is completely determined by the reduced rotational constant: the smaller the B_{red}, the less the effects that prohibit the 2D model to be a good approximation to the 4D simulations.
Correspondingly, to discuss how the field-induced coupling and the validity of the 2D model relate to each other, we analyze the structure of the field-matter Hamiltonian Ĥ^{int} for the adiabatic alignment, Eqs. (8) and (8a). Here, two sources might jeopardize the presumptions of the 2D model: (1) the change of the polarizability as the torsional angle changes and (2) the contribution of the term containing α^{(2,2)} to the excitation by the adiabatic laser pulse.
The first mechanism, namely the role of the ρ-dependent polarizabilities, of the three irreducible components of the polarizability, α^{(0,0)}, α^{(2,0)}, and α^{(2,2)}, leads to torsional excitation; the more the polarizability changes if the molecules undergo torsion, the more likely the torsional states are excited by the adiabatic pulse. Thus, even if the field-free rotational-torsional coupling was insignificant, the torsional quantum number n_{ρ} was not a true quantum number for the pendular states.
For the part of the field-matter interaction that manipulates the rotations, we again find that m is a conserved quantum number while k is not. From Eqs. (8a) and (A8), we conclude that Ĥ1int commutes with Ĵ_{z} because α_{zz} only contains rotation matrices to m = 0 and is therefore independent of ϕ. The last term on the right-hand side of Eq. (8a), however, shows us that k is changed by the interaction with the adiabatic laser pulse; terms containing D0,±22 either raise or lower the quantum number k by 2. Consequently, the larger the α^{(2,2)}, the less the presumption of the 2D model is fulfilled that the initial state can be described by k = 0. Interestingly, this finding is again related to the asymmetry of a rigid rotor—for symmetric tops, α^{(2,2)} vanishes. Therefore, we conclude, the more the molecule can be considered as an asymmetric top, the less the presumptions of the conventional 2D model are fulfilled.
The third assumption we have identified is the frozen mode approximation: the motions perpendicular to the torsional axis have to be much slower than the motions about the torsional axis. In a simplified approach, we can test this condition by calculating the time scale of the torsion
and of the rotation perpendicular to the torsion axis
Comparing both time scales, we obtain
where we used the definition of the reduced rotational constant, Eq. (3). Consequently, the smaller B_{red}, the more the time scales of both motions are separated und thus the expectation value A_{θ} changes less on the time scale of the torsion. Clearly, our results support this simple argument; see Figs. 4 and 5 in this section, the supplementary material, and Figs. 2 and 3 in Ref [17]. The rotational alignment factor A_{θ} changes only little on the time scale of the torsion, but the more it varies, the larger the reduced rotational constant is. We would like to point out, however, that this argument is not rigorous. For asymmetric tops with observable torsion, time scales in the sense of the period of corresponding wave-packets cannot be strictly defined. Yet, as our results show, Eq. (36) is a sufficient guide to decide how reasonable the frozen mode approximation is.
In summary, our theoretical analysis shows that three aspects are relevant to decide if the 2D model is a good approximation: (1) the magnitude of the reduced rotational constant B_{red}; (2) the quality of the additive model for describing the polarizability of the molecule; and (3) how much the molecule can be considered to be an asymmetric top. Thus, these conclusions support what our results in Secs. IV B–IV D show.
G. Why we need an extended 2D model in some cases
If we wish to use the conventional 2D model to describe the torsional control of molecules, these conditions pose a dilemma. On the one hand, it seems the less the additive model is valid, the more elaborate the theoretical model has to be to adequately describe torsional control. On the other hand, a strong ρ-dependence of the polarizability also corresponds to a high controllability of the torsion with moderate field strengths. This is also reflected by the systems that have been studied so far. Experimentalists usually study substituted biphenyls [2,4,10,13], for which the additive model is in particular a bad approximation. However, it is the distinct ρ-dependence of the molecular polarizability that makes them suitable candidates for experimental studies on torsional control.
Moreover, for most applications of torsional control, four-dimensional quantum models might be impractical or even unfeasible. Describing a molecule in an environment, using more complex pulse forms and developing optimal control schemes for the steering the molecular torsion, or even describing the torsional alignment of isolated molecules with lower symmetry is numerically much more demanding than the scenario we study here. Hence, if we wish to stay within a quantum mechanical picture for describing these conditions, using low-dimensional models is almost unavoidable.
To resolve this discrepancy, we think it is necessary to modify or to extend the conventional 2D model. We believe the most promising way to appropriately describe systems with strong ρ-dependence of the polarizability is to steer a middle way: the excitation of the torsion by the first laser pulse is calculated by a modified 2D model based on adiabatic separation, while for describing the excitations by the second laser pulse and the subsequent propagation in time, the conventional 2D model with a modified initial state is used. Still, calculations based on this extended 2D model would be less time-consuming than those within the 4D approach, but the new model would, at least in parts, reflect the effect of the adiabatic alignment on the torsion.
V. A CRITIQUE OF OUR APPROACH
The assumptions we make and the implementation we use to study the limitations of the two-dimensional model of torsional control in comparison to a four-dimensional, quantum mechanical treatment are limited themselves. In the following, we therefore not only discuss which phenomena our model does not include but also discuss what are the limitations of the theoretical methods we have used.
Our model is based on approximations that are commonly used in the standard approach to molecular alignment: a semi-rigid rotor, isolated from its environment, interacts with a laser field that only manipulates the rotational and torsional degrees of freedom. Earlier studies have shown that these assumptions are justified as long as we only consider time scales at the order of t_{0} and laser intensities I≤10^{14}Wcm{2}. Couplings with other molecular degrees of freedom, such as vibrations [47,48] or interactions with the environment [12,44,49], both generally leading to a decrease of alignment, usually take place on time scales that are much longer than t_{0}. Moreover, it was recently shown that strong field ionization through tunneling as a competing process to the molecular alignment is only likely to take place if the laser intensities are of the order of 10^{14}Wcm{2} or larger [50]. Although these findings are limited to the adiabatic regime and cannot be directly applied to the control of internal motions, they show that the maximal degree of alignment is often achieved at intensities well below the ionization threshold. Hence, for intensities we consider here, it is justified to assume that strong-field ionization can be ignored.
We also made some pragmatic choices concerning the methods for solving the respective Schrödinger equations. The impulsive approximation [42,51–53] we employed for describing the interaction with the femtosecond laser pulse is only valid if the laser pulse is much shorter than the typical time scale of the motion the laser is supposed to manipulate. For molecules with short time scale of the torsion, the approximation may be less reliable and the use of more elaborated methods might be necessary [3,8,11,12].
For obtaining the quantum chemical results, we employed DFT. Even with this comparably low level of theory, calculating the potential energy surfaces for molecules like Biazu or AAC is computationally still demanding and time-consuming. Additionally, calculating molecular polarizabilities at the state-of-the-art level of theory [54,55] is computationally still very difficult. Sometimes the methods we have used substantially fail to reproduce the polarizabilities of a molecule [37,41,56,57]. More sophisticated methods may lead to completely different torsional potentials and polarizabilities, as especially low barrier heights are causing practical problems when using standard quantum chemical approaches [22,58].
We stress, however, that the potential mistakes we commit by choosing the listed methodological and phenomenological limitations are systematic and affect the 4D and 2D model alike. Our conclusions concerning the comparison between 4D and 2D simulations are therefore not affected by those limitations.
Besides these general aspects, there are three phenomena we ignore that are in particular relevant for the two-step scenario we consider: the failure of the adiabatic approximation, symmetry effects, and temperature. To describe the alignment by the nanosecond laser pulse, we assume that the molecules remain in a defined quantum state, correlating unambiguously with the field-free ground state. This assumption may be wrong: as studies on rigid molecules have shown, adiabatic alignment is impossible in some cases [59–61]. Under these circumstances, the interaction of the molecules with the first laser pulse has to be modeled by a time-dependent or a diabatic model [59–61]. To search for potential crossings, we have analyzed the expansion coefficients of each pendular state to see if they change drastically under a small variation of the field strength, and thus the pendular state changes its character. We did not find any evidence for state crossings. However, this method is not exact; only a time-dependent model and experiments can tell.
Further, we limit our considerations to states with the symmetry of the field-free rotational ground state Γ^{rt}=A1g+. Yet, as recent studies have shown [9,22,34,39,51,52], the alignment dynamics strongly depends on the symmetry of the initial molecular state. Therefore, we cannot judge if the agreement of the 2D and 4D model is depending on the symmetry of the initial rotational-torsional states. Moreover, we did not take into account that the molecular symmetry group is changed if the adiabatic alignment was successful: because the number of degrees of freedom is lower than in a full 4D treatment, and the number of symmetry operations, leaving the Hamiltonian of the 2D model invariant, is lower as well [22]. We also note that our conclusions cannot be directly transferred to molecules with smaller MS groups. Unlike for G_{16}-type molecules, we cannot define one reduced rotational constant B_{red}, as these molecules lack of a symmetric-top configuration. Setting up the field-free Hamiltonian is more complicated; kinetic coupling terms might be unavoidable in the 4D case when using the IAM [21], making the analysis of the field-free coupling more difficult.
As a last aspect, we discuss the role of temperature. Earlier studies on torsional control have identified temperature as an important factor for the failure of the 2D approach to torsional alignment [14,15]. In our simulations, however, we assumed that the temperature of the molecular probe is 0 K. To finally judge if our conclusions are also true for finite temperatures, we have to extend our description to a thermal ensemble of initial states. Yet, we do not believe that the rotational-torsional coupling is increasing with temperature as earlier studies analyze [14,15]. Our simulations show that the relevant coupling mechanism is field-induced. Thus, we can always use a combination of several laser pulses to control it and to improve the degree of torsional alignment. Taking moreover into account that the field-free coupling—being the type of rotational-torsional coupling that cannot be controlled—is negligible in many cases, see Sec. IV C, we think it is not correct to conclude that temperature generally destroys the torsional alignment, and therefore, describing torsional control with the 2D model is generally incorrect.
VI. CONCLUSION: 2D MODELS ARE VALID APPROXIMATIONS AND WE NEED THEM ANYWAY
We have analyzed the requirements the 2D model, commonly used for describing the two-step mechanism of torsional control, has to meet for being an adequate approximation to the 4D semi-rigid rotor model. Recently, it has been argued that the rotational-torsional couplings not included in the 2D model destroy the torsional alignment. To address this critique, we have systematically studied the nature of the couplings and examined how they influence the rotational-torsional dynamics of G_{16}-type molecules.
We have investigated the impact of the field-free and the field-induced coupling on the rotational-torsional dynamics, in general, and how these couplings relate to the validity of the 2D model in particular. We have found that the field-free coupling is completely determined by the reduced rotational constant B_{red}. The field-induced coupling, however, is directly linked to the dependence of the polarizability on the torsion angle ρ: the more the polarizability anisotropies α^{(0,0)}, α^{(2,0)}, and α^{(2,2)} change as the molecule undergoes torsion, the larger the field-induced coupling. Consequently, if the prominent [1,3,8,9,11,12,14–16] additive model is employed for modeling the molecular polarizabilities, the field-induced rotational-torsional coupling is minimized. Our simulations have shown that the effect of the field-free rotational coupling is generally rather small. The field-induced coupling, however, is essential for inducing torsional alignment.
Moreover, we have found that, by tendency, the 2D model can reliably reproduce the results from 4D simulations if the adiabatic pulse is of moderate intensity. Typically, the 2D model slightly overestimates the torsional alignment in agreement with earlier studies [14–16]. If the intensity of the adiabatic pulse is high, our 4D simulations reveal an additional effect which is neglected in the conventional 2D model: adiabatic torsional alignment caused by the excitation of torsional states due to high field-induced coupling during the first pulse.
On a related note, we have found that the validity of the 2D model correlates with the validity of the additive model: as the field-induced coupling is minimized, the better the 2D model reproduces the results from 4D simulations, the more the additive model is a good approximation to the molecular polarizabilities.
Further, the results of our theoretical analysis suggest that it is possible to realize an extended 2D model, relying on adiabatic separation of the motions perpendicular and parallel to the torsional axis. The more appropriate such a model is, the smaller the reduced rotational constant B_{red}. This condition is in particular fulfilled for substituted biphenyls, a subclass of molecules that is often used in experiments [2,4,10,13], illustrating the practical relevance of modifying the conventional 2D approach.
Our insights, however, are limited—rotational-torsional motions on longer time scales; non-adiabatic effects during the alignment by the first laser pulse; couplings with other modes, e.g., vibrations or the environment; as well as the temperature effects have not been considered so far. Moreover, we study a class of molecules having a specific molecular symmetry group. Thus, the conclusions we made for those G_{16}-type molecules might be incorrect for molecules with other symmetries. Finally, we only take into account states of one symmetry, namely, the symmetry of the rotational-torsion ground state. We shall investigate the rotational-torsional alignment of states with different symmetries, which are excited at higher temperatures, in a future publication.
And yet, simulations of applications for which torsional control is relevant have to rely on simplified models. Developing an optimal control scheme for a molecule with lower symmetry under thermal conditions in an environment is numerically unfeasible. The main reason why we were able to perform our 4D simulations with sufficiently large basis sets is the high symmetry of the molecules we considered—a condition that is no longer fulfilled for most experimentally studied molecules. Taking further into account that the rotational and torsional alignment is underestimated if the simulations are not converged, using lower dimensional models for describing these scenarios seems unavoidable. Our studies suggest that 2D models—either in the conventional or an extended form—are able to reliably reproduce simulations based on a 4D semi-rigid rotor model. Future investigations have to show if our faith in this conclusion is justified.
SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL
APPENDIX A: DERIVATION OF THE INTERACTION HAMILTONIAN
To derive the Hamiltonian for the interaction with an off-resonant laser pulse, Eq. (7), we first need to express the space-fixed components of the molecular polarizability, α_{qq^{′}},q,q^{′}=x,y,z, in terms of the molecular-fixed components α_{QQ^{′}},Q,Q^{′}=X,Y,Z. If α is diagonal in the molecular-fixed frame, which is true for the molecules we are considering, the space-fixed-components of the molecular polarizability can be written as
where S_{Qq} denote the direction cosines as a function of the Euler angles ϕ, θ, χ [27].
To evaluate the matrix elements of Ĥiint in the symmetry-adapted basis, it is convenient to use the irreducible tensor method. Here, instead of the nine Cartesian components of α, nine irreducible components are used. For a diagonal α in the molecule-fixed frame, only three irreducible components are relevant; they can be written as [20]
Using Eq. (A1), we find the diagonal elements of α in the space-fixed coordinate system to be
which we can simplify to
if we take into account the orthogonality-relations of the direction cosines [27]
When treating molecules without observable torsion, the first term on the right-hand side of Eq. (A4) is neglected; it leads to an angle-independent shift, having no consequences for the alignment. For molecules with torsion, however, this term generally depends on the torsional variables and has to be included.
Using the explicit definition of the direction cosines [62], we obtain after some manipulations
The Wigner matrices Dm,kJ, which we have introduced in Eqs. (A6), are defined, in general, as
The small Wigner matrices dm,kJ(θ) in Eq. (A7) are tabulated in common textbooks about angular momenta; see, for example the, book of Zare [27]. Here, we employed the matrices for J = 2,
and their symmetry properties
Taking into account the explicit definition of the Wigner-matrices, Eq. (A7), we obtain the expressions in Eqs. (8a) and (8b).
For perfect alignment along the e_{z}-axis, θ = {0, π}, and for α_{xx} holds
where we have used the explicit definitions of the Wigner matrices Eqs. (A8). Since e_{Z} and e_{z} are parallel, ϕ is redundant, and we may set ϕ = 0 to obtain after some algebra
see Eq. (A2) for the definitions of the irreducible polarizabilities. If we introduce
we obtain as a final result
which is identical to the Hamilton for a linear-polarized laser pulse within the two-dimensional treatment; see Ref [9].
APPENDIX B: ON OUR CODE
How we calculate the pendular states numerically, we show diagrammatically in Fig. 9. First, the molecule; the irreducible representation of the initial state Γ; the symmetry of m (i.e., even or odd); the size of the basis set, determined by J^{max} and N_{ρ}; and the intensity of the first pulse, I1max has to be specified. The parameter o_{tor} specifies the energy above which no more torsional states are taken into account (see below); it is a multiple of the barrier height V_{B} = max (E_{0}(ρ)) − min(E_{0}(ρ)); see Table II. The parameter o_{coup} defines the order at which the expansions Eqs. (4) are truncated.
In a second step, the molecular data are called. The data for the rotational constants A, B, the parameter describing the torsional potential V_{B}, V0tor, V_{n} (n = 0, …, 6), and the parameter for the polarizabilities α0(J,K) and Pn(J,K) (n = 0, …, 2) are stored in an external subroutine; see also Fig. 10.
Afterwards, the matrix representation of the field-free Hamiltonian Ĥ^{rt}, Eq. (1), is calculated. We begin with setting up the matrix H^{tor} in the complex free rotor basis, see Eq. (11c); we use
to calculate its elements. We then transform H^{tor} to the real free rotor basis according to Eq. (23), before we project out the states of the irreducible representation Γ^{tor}, see Table IV in the work of Merer and Watson for the conditions for K_{ρ} [19]. Next, we calculate the eigenstates for the pure torsion and obtain the eigenvector matrix C^{tor}, which we use to calculate matrix representation of the Hamiltonian for the pure torsion written in its eigenbasis, H̃{tor}. The size of the torsional basis is steered by the parameter o_{tor}; all basis states having a higher eigenenergy than o_{tor}·V_{B} are discarded.
To calculate the matrix representation of Ĥρrot, we first set up the matrix representation of the functions B_{X^{2}±Y^{2}}, Eq. (2), in the complex free rotor basis; see Eq. (11c). To explicitly calculate the matrix elements of B_{X^{2}±Y^{2}},
we make use of the expansion Eq. (4) since then we only have to calculate matrix elements of the type
if we take
into account; the expansion is truncated at order o_{coup}. We then (i) change to the real free rotor basis according to Eq. (23); (ii) project out the states of the irreducible representation Γ^{tor}; and (iii) transform to the torsional eigenbasis using C^{tor}. Simultaneously, we calculate the matrix representation of the operators Ĵ^{2}, ĴZ2, and Ĵ±2 in the basis Eq. (22a) using [27]
with
We transform the resulting matrices to the Wang basis, Eq. (21), and project out all states of the irreducible representation Γ^{rot} and m-symmetry. The final form of the matrix Hρrt we obtain by calculating the direct products of the matrix representations of B_{X^{2}±Y^{2}}, Ĵ^{2}, ĴZ2, and Ĵ±2 according to Eq. (1a). Calculating the matrix representation of Ĥ^{rt} according to
completes the calculation of the field-free rotational-torsional Hamiltonian.
To obtain the matrix representation for the interaction Hamiltonian Ĥ1int, we first calculate the effective pulse strengths P1(J,K) according to Eq. (33a). Subsequently, (i) we set up the matrix representations of the polarizabilities α^{(J,K)} in the complex free rotor basis, Eq. (11c), using
with K″ = |k″|; (ii) we transform the resulting matrices to the real basis Eq. (23); (iii) we project out every basis state having the right symmetry Γ^{tor}; and (iv) we transform α^{(J,K)} to the torsional eigenbasis using C^{tor}. Accordingly, we first calculate the matrix representation of the Wigner-matrices in the symmetric-top basis Eq. (22a), using [27]
and taking into account that 3j-symbols ::: obey the selection rules
and transform it into the symmetry-adapted basis Eq. (21). Then, we calculate the matrix representation of Ĥ1int according to Eqs. (8) and (8a).
In the last step, we calculate the matrix H^{fd}=H^{rt}+H1int and diagonalize it. As a result, we obtain the adiabatic eigenenergies E^{ad} and eigenvector matrix C^{ad}.
To calculate the impulsive alignment due to the second laser pulse, we begin with specifying the molecule, the symmetry (Γ, m), and the intensity of the first laser pulse I1max. MatLab then loads the file generated by the code used for calculating the adiabatic alignment; see Appendix B 1 for details. The file contains the parameters J^{max} and N_{ρ}, which specify the basis set size, and the adiabatic energies E^{ad} and the pendular states C^{ad} in the symmetry-adapted basis. In case no adiabatic field is applied, E^{ad} and C^{ad} correspond to the field-free eigenenergies and eigenvectors, respectively. As input is furthermore required: the strength of the second laser pulse I2max, the pulse length τ, the start and end point of the propagation t_{min} and t_{max}, respectively, and the size of the time-grid t_{grid}.
After calling the molecular parameters α0(J,K) and Pi(J,K) (i = 0, …, 2), the effective interaction strengths P2(J,K) are calculated according to Eq. (33b). Subsequently, we calculate the matrix representation of the interaction Ĥ2int, c.f. Eqs. (8) and (8b); it works completely analogues to calculating Ĥ1int; see Appendix B 1, paragraph 5.
Next, we calculate the expansion coefficients of the wave packet at the end of the pulse according to Eq. (17). It is the most demanding step in terms of memory, as MatLab is not able to calculate the matrix exponential in sparse form. It is therefore unavoidable to use symmetry within all calculations.
To calculate the coefficients at time step t_{i}, we solve Eq. (15) numerically. Therefore, we need to transform every quantity of interest to the pendular state basis, using the matrix C^{ad}. Once we obtain the coefficients c(t_{i}), we calculate the expectation values A_{θ}(t) and A_{2ρ}(t). The matrix representation of the torsional alignment factor we set up first in the complex free rotor basis, see Eq. (11c), using
and
We then transform the matrix to the symmetry-adapted basis, see Eq. (23), and delete all states with wrong symmetry. As a last step, we transform the matrix representation of cos^{2}(4ρ) to the pendular states basis. Analogous to the torsional alignment factor, we calculate
first in the symmetric-top basis Eq. (22a) using Eq. (B8a), transform it to the symmetry-adapted basis, and use C^{ad} to obtain cos^{2}θ written in the pendular state basis.
Finally, we obtain the alignment factors A_{θ} and A_{2ρ} as a function of time. They are the output of the code.
