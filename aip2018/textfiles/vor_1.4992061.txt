Positive steady states for a nonlinear diffusion Beddington-DeAngelis model
The main purpose of this work is to investigate the effects of nonlinear diffusion on positive steady states in a Beddington-DeAngelis model. By the energy method and Leray-Schauder degree theory, we consider the non-existence and existence of concerning non-constant positive steady states of the model. We demonstrate that nonlinear diffusion can create non-constant positive steady-state solutions even when the random diffusion fails to do so.
I. INTRODUCTION
Since the Beddington-DeAngelis response can be generated by a number of natural mechanisms [1,2,6] and because it admits rich but biologically reasonable dynamics, it seems worthy of further study. In particular, Cantrell and Cosner [2] considered the dynamics of the following predator-prey models with the Beddington-DeAngelis functional response:
where the variables u(t, x) and v(t,x) stand for the population densities of the prey and predator species at time t and space location x, respectively; d_{1} > 0, d_{2} > 0 denote the diffusion coefficients of the prey and predator species; △ is the Laplacian operator. f_{1}(u,v)=u(1−u)−suvm+u+nv and f_{2}(u,v)=rvum+u+nv−q, where s represents the predation coefficient of predator to prey; q is the death rate of predator; the term um+u+nv is the Beddington-DeAngelis functional response. For more details on the background of this functional response, we refer to Refs [1],  [2],  [6], and  [28]. In Ref [3], Chen and Wang establish the existence of the nonconstant positive steady-states of system (1.1) by using topological degree. In particular, it is shown that if d_{1}, d_{2} are suitably large, (1.1) has no non-constant positive steady states.
It has been reported that one of the observed features in population dynamics is that different concentration levels of prey at different sites will give different signals to direct the movements of predator and vice versa [4,15,20–24]. In other words, the movement of a predator at any particular location is influenced by the gradient of the concentration of prey at that location and that of the prey is affected by the gradient of the concentration of predator at the same location [5–13,16,18]. Therefore, system (1.1) taking this effect into account should capture more interesting phenomena and patterns of underlying biological systems. One such model is
where Ω is a bounded domain in R^{n}, with smooth boundary ∂Ω; ν is the unit outward normal vector on the boundary of Ω and the Neumann boundary conditions in (1.2) imply that two species have zero flux across the domain boundary ∂Ω. d_{3} and d_{4} are non-negative constants, and they are usually referred to as the cross-diffusion coefficients. For more details on relevant biological models, see Refs [19] and  [25–27].
The main goal of this paper is to consider the effect of the nonlinear diffusion on positive steady states of (1.2). We show that (1.2) can create patterns when the corresponding model (1.1) fails. Our result indicates that the large nonlinear diffusion can create nonconstant positive solutions, namely, can cause the existence of nonconstant positive solutions. From a biological point of view, we see that the predator diffuses either to a higher or lower density region of the prey quickly enough, where spatial patterns can emerge.
The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, a priori estimates of positive solutions is presented. In Sec. III, non-existence of nonconstant positive steady-states are analysed. In Sec. IV, we discuss the effects of nonlinear diffusion on the nonconstant positive steady-states. And we give some results on the existence of nonconstant positive solutions of (1.2).
II. A PRIORI ESTIMATES OF POSITIVE SOLUTIONS
In this section, we will consider the corresponding steady state problem of (1.2),
We give a priori upper and lower bounds for positive solutions to (2.1). It is known from Ref [2] that (2.1) has a unique positive constant steady-state (u*, v^{*}) for 0 < q < (1 + m)^{−1}, where
To this aim, we need the following two results. Lemma 2.1 is due to the work of Lou and Ni [17], and Lemma 2.2 is proposed by Lin et_al [14]
Lemma 2.1 (Harnack inequality [17]). Letc(x)∈C(Ω¯),andw(x)∈C^{2}(Ω)∩C^{1}(Ω¯)be a positive solution to −△w(x)=c(x)w(x)in Ω subject to the homogeneous Neumann boundary condition. Then there exists a positive constant C = C(Ω, ∥ c(x) ∥_{∞}) such that
Lemma 2.2 (Maximum principle [14]). Suppose that g(x,w) ∈ C(Ω, R^{1}) and b_{j}(x) ∈ C(Ω), j = 1, 2, …, N.
(i) Ifw(x)∈C^{2}(Ω)∩C^{1}(Ω¯)satisfies△w(x)+∑j=1Nb_{j}(x)w_{xj}+g(x,w(x))≥0in Ω, ∂w∂ν≤0on ∂Ω, andw(x_{0})=max_{Ω¯}w(x), then g(x_{0},w(x_{0})) ≥ 0.
(ii) Ifw(x)∈C^{2}(Ω)∩C^{1}(Ω¯)satisfies△w(x)+∑j=1Nb_{j}(x)w_{xj}+g(x,w(x))≤0in Ω, ∂w∂ν≥0on ∂Ω, andw(x_{0})=min_{Ω¯}w(x), then g(x_{0},w(x_{0})) ≤ 0.In the following, we consider upper and lower bounds of positive solutions and we assume that the classical solutions are in C^{2}(Ω)∩C^{1}(Ω¯). We have the following results:
Theorem 2.3 (Upper bound). Assume that s > n, D_{1}, D_{2}are positive constants. For any positive classical solution (u, v) of (2.1), there exist positive constants C_{i} = C_{i}(d_{j}, i = 1, 2, j = 1, 2, 3, 4, s, m, n, q) such that
provided that d_{1}, d_{2} ≥ D_{1}and d_{3} ≤ D_{2}.
Proof. Let ϕ_{1}=d_{1}(1+d_{3}v)u,ϕ_{2}=d_{2}(1+d_{4}1+u)v. Assume there is x_{1}∈Ω¯ such that ϕ_{1}(x_{1})=max_{Ω¯}ϕ_{1}. Applying Lemma 2.2, we have u(x_{1}) ≤ 1, v(x_{1})≤m+1s−n, then
Let x_{2} be a point such that ϕ_{2}(x_{2})=max_{Ω¯}ϕ_{2}; therefore, by the application of the maximum principle, we can obtain
and
as 1+d_{4}(1+d_{4}1+C_{1}) is strictly increasing with respect to d_{4}. The proof is completed.
Theorem 2.4 (Lower bound). Assume s > n, d_{j} ≥ ε, where ε is a small positive constant, q≠1m+1. For any positive classical solution (u, v) of (2.1), there exist positive constants c_{i} = c_{i}(D_{1}, D_{2}, s, m, n, q) such that
provided that d_{1}, d_{2} ≥ D_{1}and d_{3} ≤ D_{2}.
Proof. Let ϕ_{1}, ϕ_{2} be defined in Theorem 2.3. Since the following inequalities hold:
According to the Harnack inequality in Lemma 2.1, there exist positive constants C_{4} = C_{4}(D_{1}, D_{2}, s, m, n, q) and C_{5} = C_{5}(D_{1}, D_{2}, s, m, n, q) such that
Therefore,
Then
We can know that max_{Ω¯}ϕ_{2}≤C_{7}min_{Ω¯}ϕ_{2} and max_{Ω¯}v≤C_{7}min_{Ω¯}v for some positive number C_{7}. By integrating the second equation of problem (2.1) in Ω, i.e.,
Thus, for any i ≥ 1, there exists some x_{i} ∈ Ω such that
which implies that u_{i} ≥ qm, yields that
If the conclusion of the positive lower bound for v does not hold, there exists a sequence {d1i,d2i,d3i}{i≥1}, with d_{1i}, d_{2i} ≥ D_{1} and d_{3i} ≤ D_{2}, and a positive solution (u_{i}, v_{i}) of (1.2) with (d_{1}, d_{2}, d_{3}) = (d_{1i}, d_{2i}, d_{3i}) satisfies
Then due to the Harnack inequality, it must hold that
By integrating the first equation of problem (2.1), we get
While 1−u_{i}−sv_{i}m+u_{i}+nv_{i}→1>0, we get a contradiction. This completes the proof.
Remark 2.5. It is worth pointing out that we do not impose any restriction on the cross-diffusion coefficient d_{4}.
III. NON-EXISTENCE OF NONCONSTANT POSITIVE STEADY-STATES
The aim of this section is to investigate the non-existence of non-constant positive steady states of problem (1.2).
Theorem 3.1. Let d_{3} = 0, and D_{1} is positive constant. Then there exists a positive constantC̃=C̃(Λ,D_{1},Ω)such that problem (1.2) has no non-constant positive steady state provided thatd_{1}>C̃,d_{2}>D_{1}.
Proof. Assume that w = (u, v)^{T} is a positive solution of (2.1). For any v ∈ L^{1}(Ω), let v¯=1|Ω|∫_{Ω}vdx. Multiplying the two equations in (2.1) by u−ūu and v−v¯v, respectively, and then integrating over Ω by parts, we get
Due to Theorems 2.3 and 2.4, for d_{1}, d_{2} ≥ D_{1} with a fixed small number D_{1} in the assumption, there exists a large positive constant C_{1}(Λ, D_{1}, Ω) > 1 such that
Thus
Arising from Yong’s inequality, we have the following estimate:
where ε is the arbitrary small positive constant.Choose ε=ε(Λ,D_{1},Ω)=min{rnC_{1}(m+C1+nC1){2},D_{1}C13}. In view of the Poincaré inequality, one can obtain
where μ_{1} is the least positive eigenvalue of −Δ over Ω with the Neumann boundary condition.Thus, we can conclude that u≡ū,v≡v¯, if
where C̃(Λ,D_{1},Ω) is a large positive number. This completes the proof.
Remark 3.2. In Theorem 3.1, by integrating the corresponding equation by u−ūu and v−v¯v, instead of u −ū and v−v¯, respectively, we can relax the requirement on d_{2}. In this situation, d_{2} has only to be larger than an arbitrary positive constant D_{1}.
IV. EXISTENCE OF NONCONSTANT POSITIVE STEADY-STATES
From the above discussion, we see that when Theorem 3.1 holds, the problem (1.2) has no non-constant positive steady state solution. In the following, we consider the effects of nonlinear diffusion in system (1.2). We shall use the Leray-Schauder degree theory to develop a general setting to establish the existence of stationary patterns for the system
where
Define
where C is a positive constant that is guaranteed to exist by Theorems 2.3 and 2.4. Since the determinant det Φ_{w}(w) of Φ_{w}(w) is positive for all non-negative w, Φw−1 exists and detΦw−1 is positive. Hence, w is a positive solution to (2.1) if and only if
where (I − △)^{−1} is the inverse of (I − △) in X with the homogeneous Neumann boundary condition. As G(·) is a compact perturbation of an identity operator, the Leray-Schauder deg(G(⋅),0,B(C)) is well-defined if G(w) ≠ 0 for all w∈∂B.
Furthermore, we note that
We recall that if D_{w}G does not have any pure imaginary or zero eigenvalue, the index of G at the isolated fixed point w* is defined as index (G(·), w*) = (−1)^{r}, where r is the total number of eigenvalues of D_{w}G(w*) with negative real parts (counting multiplicities). Then the degree deg(G(⋅),0,B(C)) is equal to the sum of the indexes over all isolated solutions to G = 0 in B(C), provided that G ≠ 0 on ∂B(C).
Let {μ_{i},φ_{i}}i=1∞ be an eigenpair of the operator −△ on Ω with the Neumann boundary condition, where 0 = μ_{1} < μ_{2} ≤ μ_{3} ≤⋯, E(μ_{i}) be the eigenspace corresponding to μ_{i} in C^{1}(Ω¯), {φ_{ij}; j = 1, 2, …, dimE(μ_{i})} be an orthonormal basis of E(μ_{i}).
Let
Consider the following decomposition:
where X_{i}=⊕j=1dimE(μ_{i})X_{ij} is the eigenspace corresponding to μ_{i}.
We refer to the decomposition (4.3) in our following discussion of the eigenvalues of D_{w}G(w*). First, we know X_{ij} is invariant under D_{w}G(w*) for each i ∈ N and each j ∈ [1, dimE(μ_{i})] ∩ N. Thus, μ is an eigenvalue of D_{w}G(w*) on X_{ij} if and only if it is an eigenvalue of the matrix
Hence, D_{w}G(w*) is invertible if and only if, for any i ≥ 1, the matrix
is non-singular. Define
We note that if H(μ_{i}) ≠ 0, then for each j ∈ [1, dimE(μ_{i})] the number of negative eigenvalues of D_{w}G(w*) on X_{ij} is odd if and only if H(μ_{i}) < 0. Therefore, we can conclude the following result.
Theorem 4.1. Assume that, for each i ≥ 1, the matrixμ_{i}I−[Φw(w*)]{−1}F_{w}(w^{*})is non-singular. Then
To calculate index (G(·), w*), we will carefully consider the sign of H(μ). In addition,
and det[Φw(w*)]{−1}>0, therefore, we only need to consider the sign of det{μΦ_{w}(w*) − F_{w}(w*)}, where
The direct calculation gives
where
Let μ¯{1} and μ¯{2} be the two roots of B(μ) = 0 with Reμ¯{1}≤Reμ¯{2}. Then
On the other hand,
where
In view of (4.4), by use of the earnest analysis, we have the following result.
Lemma 4.2. Assume Λ_{1} > 0. Then there exists a positive constantd4*such that ford_{4}≥d4*, the two rootsμ¯{1}(d_{4})andμ¯{2}(d_{4})of B(μ) = 0 are all real and satisfy
where
Now we establish the existence of non-constant positive solutions to (1.2) with respect to the cross-diffusion coefficient d_{4}, as the other parameters are all fixed. The result is as follows:
Theorem 4.3. Suppose that the parameters d_{i}, i = 1, 2, 3, and other parameters are all fixed and Λ_{1} > 0. Ifμ¯∈(μ_{n},μ_{n+1})for some n ≥ 1 and the sumσ_{n}=∑i=2ndimE(μ_{i})is odd, then there exists a positive constantd4*such that ifd_{4}>d4*, (1.2) has at least one non-constant positive solution.
Proof. By Lemma 4.2, there exists a positive constant d4* such that when d_{4}≥d4*, (4.5) holds and
We shall prove that for any d_{4}>d4*, (1.2) has at least one non-constant positive solution. The proof, which is accomplished by contradiction, is based on the homotopy invariance of the topological degree. Suppose on the contrary that the assertion is not true for some d_{4}=d¯{4}>d4*. Let d_{4} be fixed as d¯{4}.For t ∈ [0, 1], define
and then consider the problem
Then w is a non-constant positive solution of (1.2) if and only if it is a non-constant positive solution of (4.6) for t = 1. It is evident that w* is the unique constant positive solution of (4.6) for any t ∈ [0, 1]. According to (4.2), we know that for any t ∈ [0, 1], w is a positive solution of (4.6) if and only if
It is obvious that G(1, w) = G(w). Theorem 3.1 indicates that G(0, w) = 0 only has the positive constant solution w* in X^{+}. By a direct calculation, we get
For t = 1, in view of Lemma 4.2, we can obtain
Therefore, 0 is not an eigenvalue of the matrix μ_{i}I−[Φw(w*)]{−1}F_{w}(w^{*}) for all i ≥ 1, and
is odd.In addition, in virtue of Theorem 4.1, we have
For t = 0, we have H(μ_{i}) > 0 for all i ≥ 1. By the same way, we can prove that
Thus, by Theorems 2.3 and 2.4, there exists a positive constant C such that for all t ∈ [0, 1], the positive solution of (4.6) satisfies 1C<u,v<C and G(t; w) ≠ 0 on ∂B(C). By the homotopy invariance of the topological degree, we get
By our supposition, both equations G(1, w) = 0 and G(0, w) = 0 have only the constant positive solution w* in B(C). In view of (4.9) and (4.10), we have
which contradicts (14). This finishes the proof.
Remark 4.4. In Ref [3], Chen and Wang showed that for fixed parameters and certain d_{2}, the corresponding steady state problem of (1.1) has no nonconstant positive steady states for large d_{1}. Then for the fixed d_{1}, Theorem 4.3 shows that nonconstant positive steady states can emerge as the cross-diffusion coefficient d_{4}becomes large enough, which reveals that the cross-diffusion can create spatial patterns but the random diffusion d_{1}fails.For d_{2}, we have
where
Similarly, in view of (4.4), by use of the earnest analysis, we have the following result.
Lemma 4.5. AssumeΛ1′>0.Then there exists a positive constantd2*such that ford_{2}≥d2*, the two rootsμ¯{1}(d_{2})andμ¯{2}(d_{2})of B(μ) = 0 are all real and satisfy
where
Now we establish the existence of non-constant positive solutions to (1.2) with respect to the cross-diffusion coefficient d_{2}, as the other parameters are all fixed. The result is as follows:
Theorem 4.6. Suppose that the parameters d_{i}, i = 1, 3, 4, and other parameters are all fixed andΛ1′>0.Ifμ¯{′}∈(μ_{n},μ_{n+1})for some n ≥ 1 and the sumσ_{n}=∑i=2ndimE(μ_{i})is odd, then there exists a positive constantd2*such that ifd_{2}>d2*, (1.2) has at least one non-constant positive solution.
