Effects of topologies on signal propagation in feedforward networks
We systematically investigate the effects of topologies on signal propagation in feedforward networks (FFNs) based on the FitzHugh-Nagumo neuron model. FFNs with different topological structures are constructed with same number of both in-degrees and out-degrees in each layer and given the same input signal. The propagation of firing patterns and firing rates are found to be affected by the distribution of neuron connections in the FFNs. Synchronous firing patterns emerge in the later layers of FFNs with identical, uniform, and exponential degree distributions, but the number of synchronous spike trains in the output layers of the three topologies obviously differs from one another. The firing rates in the output layers of the three FFNs can be ordered from high to low according to their topological structures as exponential, uniform, and identical distributions, respectively. Interestingly, the sequence of spiking regularity in the output layers of the three FFNs is consistent with the firing rates, but their firing synchronization is in the opposite order. In summary, the node degree is an important factor that can dramatically influence the neuronal network activity.
I. INTRODUCTION
One of the central problems in neuroscience is characterizing the propagation and processing of a neural signal in a neural network, which is strongly related to the network's properties, such as the coupling strength and linkage probability between neurons or the network structure [1,2]. The effects of these parameters on signal propagation have been broadly studied, and various phenomena that are related to network properties have been found [3–5].
A neural network coupled by chemical synapses has been found to be more efficient for transferring a local input signal than one using electrical coupling, while neural networks with electrical synapses are more efficient for transferring a global input signal than chemical synapses [6]. Investigations of network topologies with vibrational resonance have shown that a small-world network needs less stimuli than a random network to produce an optimal synchronization state between the firing patterns of a network and a weak input signal [7]. The structural properties of a randomly connected neural network, including the connection probability, synaptic coupling strength, and the neuron heterogeneity, have also been shown to play important roles in weak signal propagation [8]. Because the brain is a highly modular structure, it is essential to investigate the neural coding with a modular network that can transmit information from one module to another.
A multilayer feedforward network (FFN), which is composed of multiple-groups neurons with convergent-divergent connections between adjacent layers, is one of the most extensively studied structures for the propagation of neural code [1,9]. Because of its structure, a signal is transmitted from one layer of neurons to the next, and many physiological phenomena have been reproduced with FFNs. The two main information transmission mechanisms in neural networks, rate coding and temporal coding, both exist in this framework [1,10]. The propagation of the rate code in an FFN has been found to be related to the spatial coherence of neuronal spiking, i.e., the synchronization state [4,11–13]. The synchronous firing state of FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) neurons in an FFN can be induced and modulated by noise [4]. The synfire-enhanced phenomenon of weak signal propagation has also been observed in an FFN when a weak signal with low frequency is disturbed by a high-frequency signal [14]. Temporal code, which is associated with precisely timed sequential firings of neurons, is also observed in FFNs [2,15]. Recently, signal propagation in self-organized FFNs with spike-timing dependent plasticity has been studied, and the relationship between synaptic connections and signal propagation is explored [16–18]. However, the topological distributions for neuron connections in an FFN have not been systematically investigated.
In most previous studies, the linkage of neurons between layers is set with a fixed connection probability, where the number of convergent and divergent connections to each neuron is almost the same [4,14]. However, in reality, there should be more kinds of coupling distributions for neurons [19,20]. An investigation on the effects of topology on signal propagation in FFNs will be helpful for a comprehensive understanding of the coding and decoding of neural systems.
This paper is structured as follows: The effects of the topological structure of an FFN on the firing patterns and firing rates of each layer are first studied. Then, the effects of three critical parameters, node degree, firing synchronization, and spiking regularity, are further investigated for the different topologies. Finally, the discussion and conclusion are given.
II. METHODS AND MATERIALS
A. Description of feedforward neural network
The multi-layer FFN is a commonly used framework for mimicking the propagation of the spatial-temporal code from one group of neurons to another [2,15]. The FFNs in this study are composed of FHN neurons, which is a simplification of the famous Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model. An FHN has essential neuronal properties such as a threshold and refractoriness, and can describe the qualitative response of an excitable neuron to input stimuli. As shown in Fig. 1, an FFN is constructed of 200 FHN neurons in each layer without recurrent or feedback connections between layers. The neurons in each layer receive synaptic currents from the previous layer, and transmit their spikes to the neurons in the next layer through synaptic connections. There are also no couplings between neurons of the same layer. The network model is described as follows:
Here, the layer indices are i=1,2,3…N_{L}, and the neuron indices in each layer are j=1,2,3…N. Moreover, x_{i,j} and y_{i,j} denote the membrane potential and recovery variable of each neuron, respectively, and Ii,jsyn(t) is the total of synaptic current of neuron j in layer i. In the last equation of (1), α(t)=(t/τ)e^{−t/τ}, where τ is the synapse time constant. In addition, Ni,jsyn represents the number of synaptic couplings from (j-1)th layer to ith neuron in jth layer. The synaptic parameters, that is, the coupling strength between neurons g_{syn} and synapse time constant τ are set as g_{syn}=0.08 and τ=0.3, which are large enough to propagate the signal through layers of FFNs. The synaptic reversal potential V_{syn} is used to determine the type of synapse, where all the synapses in this investigation are created as excitatory synapses by setting V_{syn}=0 [14]. The connection probability P between layers is set to 0.1, which means that there are 4000 synaptic connections between adjacent layers. In addition, the summation of Ni,jsyn of the neurons in each layer is identical for all three FFNs.
To study the effects of degree distribution on signal propagation, FFNs with three topological distributions for neuron couplings are created by modifying the connections between neurons. That is, for each of the three topological FFNs, the total number of incoming connections for each layer in the three types of FFN is set the same, but the in-degree and out-degree distributions of the neurons in each layer differ as identical, uniform or exponential distributions. In detail, the uniform distribution is defined with numbers drawn from the standard uniform distribution on the interval [0, 2*P*N], where N is the number of neurons in one layer (here, N=200, P=0.1). Thus, the maximum in-degree distribution allowed in the uniform distribution is 40. The third in-degree distribution of neurons used here is drawn from the exponential distribution with a probability density function as f(x)=λe^{−λx}, and mean of E(x)=1/λ, where λ is set as 1/(P*N). In Fig. 2, we use the mean results of 50 repetitive simulations to show the degree distributions of neurons for three topological structures as the neuronal connections are not fixed between different simulations. Randomness is set for the connections of neurons before each simulation to make the results more reliable, which also leads to variation for in-degree and out-degree of neurons of the latter two FFNs produced each time. Considering that the neuron number in identical distribution is too big (1800) to show it with the same scale as the other two distributions, we use the mean values of nearby degrees to represent the neuron number of a certain degree, which reduces the neuron number in identical distribution obviously. This calculation method is applied to all three distributions in Fig. 2. In addition, it should be mentioned that there are a few differences between the distributions of in-degree and out-degree in each topological structure because we just fix the in-degree of neurons (i.e., for one neuron in a certain layer, the neurons connected to it in the previous layer are fixed before each simulation according to the in-degree distribution of the network, but we have not fixed the output connection of the neuron specially) and the out-degree of neurons are changing along with the changes of in-degree distribution, which is much easier for us to handle both the in-degree and out-degree distributions for each topological structure.
In the FHN neural model, parameter a is a critical parameter that could substantially affect the dynamics of the system. For a single FHN model without inputs and noise, the Andronov-Hopf bifurcation occurs at a≈0.69(ε=0.08 and b=0.45). When a>0.69, the neuron is in the excitable region. When a<0.69, the system has a stable periodic solution. The Canard phenomenon can be observed near a=0.69. Here, we use ε=0.08,a=0.75, and b=0.45 for the neurons to ensure that they are excitable [21].
B. Indexes of firing synchronization and spiking regularity
The synchronization of each layer in an FFN is characterized by average cross correlation parameter K, which is calculated based on the firing times of neurons in one layer as
where K_{j}(δ) represents the firing synchronization of neuron j with other neurons in the same layer, which is calculated as
and K_{j,m}(δ) is defined as
To be specific, we first transform the spiking binary series into a spiking train after dividing the time series into k bins. Parameter δ represents the length of the bins. Then, each element in X is set as 1 or 0 according to the presence of spikes. That is, if there is a spike in the ith bin X, X(i)=1; otherwise, X(i)=0. Finally, the synchronized state is estimated using the value of K, where the layer is more likely to be a synchronized state if the value of K is close to 1. Conversely, the layer is more likely to be a desynchronized state if the value of K is close to 0.
The regularity of interspike intervals (ISI) is used to characterize the temporal features of firing patterns, which is quantified by the sharpness of the ISI distribution R. First, R^{j} is calculated as R^{j}=〈Tqj〉{t}/Var(Tqj), where Tqj is the ISI time series of neuron j. Here, j=1,2,…,N is the index of neurons in one layer of an FFN, and q indicates the number of time intervals in the ISI time series. Moreover, 〈〉{t} denotes the average value over time, and Var(Tqj) denotes the variance of the ISI time series of neuron j. Then, R is obtained by averaging the R^{j} of all neurons in one layer.
III. RESULTS
A. Effects of topologies on the propagation of firing patterns
To investigate the effects of topologies on the propagation of firing patterns, the number of synaptic connections in each layer is set to be the same for all three FFN topologies, and the connection probability between adjacent layers is also set to be the same. The differences between the three topological structures are the degree distributions of neurons. Moreover, spike trains with a firing rate r_{1} in a Poisson distribution are generated and set as the output of layer 1 for the three FFN topologies.
Figure 3 shows raster plots of the spikes in the representative layers of FFNs, in which the topologies of the neuron connections in Figs. 3(a) through 3(c) correspond to the identical, uniform, and exponential distributions, respectively. For all three distributions, the neurons fire synchronously after the spikes have propagated through several layers, even though the spikes of the neurons in layer 1 of FFNs are irregular. The firing patterns of all three FFN topologies are found to become more synchronous and regular after layer 6. Moreover, fewer firing trains survive in the later layers of the FFN with identical distribution than for FFNs with a uniform distribution or an exponential distribution, and the number of firing trains in the FFN with an exponential distribution is the highest. Considering the similar spike trains of the first layer and the same degree number of neurons in each layer of the FFNs, the topological structure of the networks should play an essential role in modulating the firing patterns of the FFNs.
B. Effects of topologies on the propagation of firing rates
The effects of topologies on the propagation of firing rates are studied using the three FFNs constructed above. Similarly, the spike trains in a Poisson distribution are set as the output of layer 1 in the FFNs (r_{1}).
1. Relationship between input and output firing rates
The output firing rates of the three FFN topologies corresponding to different input firing rates are shown in Fig. 4, where the mean values and standard deviation for the output firing rate are calculated from 20 simulations (each simulation produces one output firing rate corresponding to different input firing rates). When the input firing rate r_{1} is increased from 10 Hz to 100 Hz, the output firing rate r_{10} of the FFN with an exponential distribution is always the largest, while the output firing rate of the FFN with an identical distribution is always the smallest. Moreover, differences in the output firing rates for the three distributions emerged even when the input firing rate is very small. These results indicate that the sensitivity of the three FFN topologies to an input signal differs, which is induced by the network topologies because the initial neuronal dynamics, input signal, and other network properties are equal. Note that broader in-degree distributions (e.g., the uniform and exponential distributions) mean that more neurons have higher in-degrees than the identical distribution, and neurons with high in-degrees are more likely to fire at a high rate. The frequent and stable firing of these neurons further increases the likelihood that neurons in the next layer will fire. In summary, the neurons with high in-degrees can be viewed as the pacemakers of the FFNs because they cause more neurons that have connections with them to fire, thus leading to a higher firing rate of the network.
2. Firing rates of different layers in the FFNs
To further explore the effects of topology on information transfer in FFNs, the firing rate of each layer in the FFN corresponding to a fixed input firing rate (r_{1}) is calculated, and the mean values and standard deviation of the firing rate from 20 simulations are shown. As shown in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b), the firing rate first decreases, then increases after propagating through several layers in the FFNs. When the input firing rate is 50 Hz, the output firing rate of the FFN with an exponential distribution is larger than the input firing rate [Fig. 5(a)]. The output firing rate of the FFN with a uniform distribution is approximately the same as the input firing rate, and the output firing rate of the FFN with an identical distribution is much smaller than the input firing rate. When the input firing rate is increased to 80 Hz, the output firing rate of the FFN with an exponential or a uniform distribution is much larger than its input firing rates [Fig. 5(b)]. However, the output firing rate of the FFN with an identical distribution is still smaller than the input firing rate, suggesting that it is less sensitive to the input signal. Furthermore, the firing rate of all three FFNs first decreases, then increases, and finally attains a steady state when the signal is propagated through the layers. The variation trend of the firing rate here should be related to the interplay of the network topology and the neuron excitability, where the two aspects jointly determine the variation of firing rates of layers when the signal is propagated in FFNs.
C. Spiking regularity and firing synchronization of different layers in the three FFN topologies
Spiking regularity is one criterion that is used to characterize the temporal regularity of spike trains in FFNs. As shown in Figs. 6(a) and 6(b), the propagation of spiking regularity through the layers of the FFNs is different for the three topologies, including the change in behavior and the final distribution of R corresponding to the output layer. The spiking regularity of the three FFNs is found to tend to increase compared with the regularity of the first layer when the spikes propagate through the layers, where the spiking regularity of the FFN with an exponential distribution has the highest increase and the spiking regularity of the FFN with an identical distribution has the lowest increase of the three FFNs [Fig. 6(a)]. A local maximum in the FFN with the identical distribution appears [Fig. 6(a)], which is caused by the interaction between network topology and neuron excitability. Statically, the increased regularity in layer 3 and 4 of FFN with the identical distribution is related to the changes of ISI of neurons. That is, a relatively increase in the mean ISI values of neurons in the two layers compared with the changes of standard variation of ISI (the results are not shown here). In addition, when the initial firing rate is increased to 80 Hz, the spiking regularity tends to increase even more through the layers [Fig. 6(b)]. Thus, the spiking regularity of the FFNs is intensively dependent on the degree distribution and the initial firing rate of the FFNs.
It is interesting that the spiking regularity of the FFN with an identical distribution is the lowest, although a neural network with the same in-degree and out-degree for each neuron should have a more regular spiking behavior because the neurons receive a more similar input. In fact, FFNs with a broader degree distribution (i.e., an FFN with a uniform or exponential distribution) will have more neurons fire at a high rate, and these neurons play the role of pacemakers in the network. This can further make their postsynaptic neurons fire with a high probability. However, an FFN with the same node degree for each neuron does not have neurons that are firing steadily. This further leads to a lower firing rate and more irregular firings of the postsynaptic neurons than in an FFN with a broader neuron degree distribution.
The firing synchronization (K) of an FFN, which is usually used as a critical criterion for characterizing the spatial coherence of spikes between neurons, is also shown in Figs. 6(c) and 6(d). The firing synchronization of the three FFN topologies is much lower in the first several layers than in the latter layers. It increases obviously after propagation in the middle layers, and attains a stable state in the latter layers. By comparing the K and R values of the three topologies, the sequence of the firing synchronization in output layers for exponential and identical distributions is found to be opposite to their spiking regularity in the three FFNs [Fig. 6(a) versus Fig. 6(c) and Fig. 6(b) versus Fig. 6(d)]. Similarly, the sequences for the K and F values of the output layers in the three FFNs are also found to be opposite [Fig. 5(a) versus Fig. 6(c) and Fig. 5(b) versus Fig. 6(d)], i.e., high firing rates correspond to low firing synchronization and vice versa. These results clarify that the FFN with an identical distribution needs more input stimuli to produce a relatively high firing rate in the output layer compared with the two other distributions because it has a lower firing rate in each layer despite the same input stimuli being given. Moreover, for FFNs with uniform and exponential distributions, it is relatively easier to amplify the input firing rate than it is for the FFN with an identical distribution.
The opposite sequences between the spiking regularity and firing synchronization for three FFN topologies should also be related to the interaction between neuron excitability and network topology. Consider that the FFN with identical distribution has a low firing rate and the in-degrees of neurons are the same as that of each other, the firing times of many neurons are similar to that of each other and the ISI of neurons are relatively long. Neurons with similar firing frequencies are more likely to fire synchronously than neurons with broad distribution for firing times [Fig. 7(a)]. However, it is difficult to determine the corresponding relationship between the firing rate and spiking regularity. When the firing rate of a neuron is high, both the mean value and standard variance of its ISI are lower than that of the neuron with a low firing rate. But the spiking regularity of the two neurons is difficult to compare because it is characterized by the quotient of the two parameters above. To make it clear, the relationship between the spiking regularity of neurons and their firing rates is shown in Fig. 7(b). It can be easily found in layer 6 that the spiking regularity has an increasing trend with the increase of neurons' firing rates of three FFN topologies, which further leads to the increasing sequences for their mean spiking regularity. Thus, these results suggest that the opposite sequence for the firing synchronization and spiking regularity of the output layer in three FFN topologies are related to the firing rate of the networks (Figs. 5, 6, and 7).
D. Detailed illustration for the effects of topology on signal propagation
Checkerboard maps are used to show the detailed changes in the three criteria, where each color in the map corresponds to the value of a certain criterion (Fig. 8). Here, r_{1} represents the firing rate of layer 1. As shown in Figs. 8(a) to 8(c), the firing rate in the FFNs with all three topologies first decreases from the initial input firing rate, then increases gradually with the number of layers, and finally attains a stable state in the latter layers. The firing rate in the output layer of the three FFN topologies is easily found to differ despite the same spiking trains being set in the input layer. The output firing rate of the FFN with an exponential distribution is the largest, and the output firing rate of the FFN with an identical distribution is the smallest. However, the sequence of firing synchronization for the FFNs of all three topologies is opposite to the sequence of firing rates, where the FFN with the identical distribution has the highest firing synchronization and the firing synchronizations of the FFNs with the uniform and exponential distributions are lower in sequence [Figs. 8(d)–8(f)]. Interestingly, the spiking regularity in Figs. 8(g) to 8(i) tends to increase in the output layers with the changes of network topology in sequence, which is similar to the firing rate behavior but opposite to the firing synchronization behavior. The difference between the change in behavior of spiking regularity and firing rate is that there is no local minimum in the value of R when it is propagated through the layers.
E. Effects of the node degree on the firing rate and spiking regularity for each topology
The node degree is also an important criterion for characterizing the effects of the topology distribution on signal propagation and processing in FFNs, which can be split into the in-degree and out-degree for each neuron. Because the presynaptic neurons can directly influence the spikes of postsynaptic neurons, only the effects of the in-degree of neurons on signal propagation in FFNs are shown here. Figure 9 shows the firing rate of three representative layers in the FFNs corresponding to the in-degrees of neurons for the three topologies. Clearly, the distribution of the in-degree plays an essential role in influencing the firing rate of the neurons as well as the network. When the in-degrees of the neurons are set as identical distribution, the variance of the firing rate decreases as the layer index increases. When the in-degree distribution is uniform or exponential, a corresponding relationship between the firing rate and in-degree for each neuron is found in the front layers (i.e., layers 2 and 4), where neurons with high in-degrees often have a high firing rate, and the distribution of the firing rate is broader. However, in the latter layers (i.e., layer 6), the relationship between the firing rate and in-degree of each neuron almost disappears, that is, there is not an obvious difference between the firing rate of neurons with high and low in-degrees when the in-degree is larger than 10. This should be related to the synchronous firing state of neurons which can modulate their synaptic current to postsynaptic neurons in the next layer, i.e., the rhythmic firing patterns in later layers of an FFN have a constraint or facilitative effect on the firing rates of neurons due to the difference of node degrees, leading to uniform firing frequencies for the individual neurons of later layers. Furthermore, note that all neurons are firing in layer 6 of an FFN with identical distribution.
The relationship between the in-degree and spiking regularity R of each neuron in different layers of the FFNs is also investigated for all three topologies. As Fig. 10 shows, almost all of the neurons in the FFNs fire when the in-degree is larger than 15. The in-degree of each neuron in the FFN with an identical distribution causes the spiking regularity of neurons to be more concentrated after the firing signal is propagated through the layers, and this result is similar to the changes in spiking regularity in the FFNs with uniform and exponential distributions. In addition, most of the neurons' spiking activities in FFNs with exponential distribution are more regular than those of FFNs with uniform distribution. That is, a broad degree distribution of neurons can lead to the increase of the mean spiking regularity of the network, but it does not cause an obvious increase or decrease in the spiking regularity of each neuron. Because the spiking regularity of neurons is related to their ISI distributions, in which the in-degree and out-degree of each neuron play a major role in the spiking regularity in the front layers, but the mean firing rate of the network will become the main effect on the spiking regularity during its propagation in the latter layers (Figs. 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10).
IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
The topology, or node degree distribution of neurons in a neural network, which widely exists in real cerebral cortexes, plays an essential role in neuronal signal propagation [20,22]. It can influence the synchronizability [23,24] and sensitivity of networks to an input signal [25,26].
In our investigation, it is found that the node degree distribution can modulate the firing patterns and firing rates in FFNs. The relationships between signal propagation and three node degree distributions (identical, uniform, and exponential distributions) are investigated in detail. Synchronous spike trains are observed in the latter layers of the three FFNs, and the amount of them in the output layer is strongly related to the node degree distributions of the neurons in the FFNs. When the node degree distribution of the neurons in the FFN is exponential, the firing rate in the output layer is much larger than it is for the two other distributions, and the firing rate in the output layer of the FFN with an identical distribution is the smallest. However, the order of firing synchronization in output layers of the three FFNs is opposite to that of the firing rates, i.e., the firing synchronization in the output layers of the three FFNs goes from more synchronous to less synchronous in the order of identical, uniform, and exponential node degree distributions. Thus, our study suggests that FFNs with broader node degree distributions correspond to higher firing rates and lower firing synchronization. Recently, one investigation showed that the broader in-degree distribution of excitatory connections can promote oscillations although the network structure (a network with recurrent connections) was different from ours [27]. The similarity for the two networks is that they all have broader in-degree distributions, which can make more neurons fire at relatively high rates and lead to an increased mean firing rate for the network. There are also investigations that have shown that the connectivity distribution statistics can significantly influence network synchronization [24], but this study also has differences with respect to ours. The investigation above changes the network structure by modulating the distribution of rewired connections in a small-world network, and it finds that the long-tail distribution of rewired connections (such as an exponential distribution) can result in high firing synchronization. However, the connectivity distribution statistics of the FFN here refers to the in-degree distribution of the neurons, which is different from the distribution of the rewired connections. Furthermore, the synchronization mechanism is also different because of their network structures, in which the recurrent connections in a small-world network can play a key role in the collective activity of the network [28].
The propagation of temporal regularity in the layers of FFNs is also found to be correlated with the in-degree distribution of the neurons. Synaptic currents from the previous layers determine neuronal spike timing, and the amount of current is strongly affected by the node degree distribution of each neuron. Thus, the difference of the node degree distribution of the neurons leads to different spiking regularity in the three FFN topologies. When the node degree distribution of the neurons is identical, the FFN is not sensitive to the input stimuli and each neuron in the FFN needs more excitation to fire than in networks with the two other distributions (Fig. 4). When the node degree distribution is uniform, the sensitivity of the network to the input signal and output firing rate increases (Fig. 4). When the node degree distribution is exponential, the network is much more sensitive to the input signal because more neurons with a high in-degree act as pacemakers in the FFN, which makes their postsynaptic neurons fire with a higher probability (Fig. 4). Therefore, the same input signal can result in different firing regularity due to the node degree distribution of the neurons in an FFN. Several investigations have found that broader in-degree distributions could increase the firing regularity of the network [29,30]. It is shown that the broad in-degree distribution increases the mean firing rate of the network and leads to high regular firing activities of the network, which is consistent with our observations. But there exist several differences between their mechanisms and ours, as their networks are composed of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons with recurrent connections, while our networks are purely excitatory and feed-forward.
The degree distribution has been widely studied in complex networks. However, there are differences between our study and others. First, there are few studies about the degree distribution in FFNs. In Ref [7], the effects of the node degree on signal propagation are investigated with a randomly connected network and small-world network. In Ref [8], the node degree in a randomly connected network is studied by changing the connection probability between neurons. Thus, their network structures are different than ours. Second, previous investigations of signal propagation in FFNs focus on the effects of background activity or the initial dynamics of neurons [4,14,24], where the mechanism of these factors should be different from that of degree distribution. The node degree changes the signal propagation in FFN by modulating the synaptic currents according to the distribution of the in-degrees and out-degrees of neurons. The initial dynamics of neurons, which can selectively determine the spike time of a neuron, are regarded as a neuronal property that regulates the neuron activities. Background noise can influence signal propagation in an FFN through coherence or stochastic resonance, where its intensity is preserved as an effect of the in-degree of the neurons [4]. However, the interaction mechanism is different among the three factors. In contrast to the change in background activity of an FFN, different degree distributions modulate the sensitivity of a network to signal propagation through the network structure.
In conclusion, this study enables us to understand the effects of three FFN topologies on signal propagation. The findings in this paper may be significant for signal transmission in neural networks because it clarifies that the node degree distribution can modulate the firing synchronization and spiking regularity of neurons in FFNs. The effects of the initiation dynamics of neurons [31], synaptic plasticity [16,32], and effects of endogenous fields [33] together with the degree distributions will be explored in future studies.
In neural networks, the topological structure of a network has been shown to play an important role in neural coding and decoding. Recently, the structure and function of feedforward networks (FFNs) have been studied widely because the FFN is a model typically used for investigating signal propagation. However, the topologies of FFNs have not yet been investigated systematically. Using the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) neuron model, FFNs with different degree distributions (identical, uniform, and exponential distributions) are constructed. The temporal firing patterns of an FFN with an exponential distribution have been found to be more regular than those of the other two distributions, and the spiking regularity of an FFN with an identical distribution is the lowest one. However, the firing synchronization of the output layer in an FFN displays the opposite order, from high to low synchronization, for identical, uniform, and exponential distributions. Moreover, FFNs with different topologies show distinct output firing rates in response to the same input signal, which indicates that the FFNs have different sensitivities to the input signal, which is induced by their topological structures. The investigation of this paper is essential for a deep understanding of the effects of the topology (degree distribution) on neural coding and decoding in FFNs.
One of the central problems in neuroscience is characterizing the propagation and processing of a neural signal in a neural network, which is strongly related to the network's properties, such as the coupling strength and linkage probability between neurons or the network structure [1,2]. The effects of these parameters on signal propagation have been broadly studied, and various phenomena that are related to network properties have been found [3–5].
A neural network coupled by chemical synapses has been found to be more efficient for transferring a local input signal than one using electrical coupling, while neural networks with electrical synapses are more efficient for transferring a global input signal than chemical synapses [6]. Investigations of network topologies with vibrational resonance have shown that a small-world network needs less stimuli than a random network to produce an optimal synchronization state between the firing patterns of a network and a weak input signal [7]. The structural properties of a randomly connected neural network, including the connection probability, synaptic coupling strength, and the neuron heterogeneity, have also been shown to play important roles in weak signal propagation [8]. Because the brain is a highly modular structure, it is essential to investigate the neural coding with a modular network that can transmit information from one module to another.
A multilayer feedforward network (FFN), which is composed of multiple-groups neurons with convergent-divergent connections between adjacent layers, is one of the most extensively studied structures for the propagation of neural code [1,9]. Because of its structure, a signal is transmitted from one layer of neurons to the next, and many physiological phenomena have been reproduced with FFNs. The two main information transmission mechanisms in neural networks, rate coding and temporal coding, both exist in this framework [1,10]. The propagation of the rate code in an FFN has been found to be related to the spatial coherence of neuronal spiking, i.e., the synchronization state [4,11–13]. The synchronous firing state of FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) neurons in an FFN can be induced and modulated by noise [4]. The synfire-enhanced phenomenon of weak signal propagation has also been observed in an FFN when a weak signal with low frequency is disturbed by a high-frequency signal [14]. Temporal code, which is associated with precisely timed sequential firings of neurons, is also observed in FFNs [2,15]. Recently, signal propagation in self-organized FFNs with spike-timing dependent plasticity has been studied, and the relationship between synaptic connections and signal propagation is explored [16–18]. However, the topological distributions for neuron connections in an FFN have not been systematically investigated.
In most previous studies, the linkage of neurons between layers is set with a fixed connection probability, where the number of convergent and divergent connections to each neuron is almost the same [4,14]. However, in reality, there should be more kinds of coupling distributions for neurons [19,20]. An investigation on the effects of topology on signal propagation in FFNs will be helpful for a comprehensive understanding of the coding and decoding of neural systems.
This paper is structured as follows: The effects of the topological structure of an FFN on the firing patterns and firing rates of each layer are first studied. Then, the effects of three critical parameters, node degree, firing synchronization, and spiking regularity, are further investigated for the different topologies. Finally, the discussion and conclusion are given.
The multi-layer FFN is a commonly used framework for mimicking the propagation of the spatial-temporal code from one group of neurons to another [2,15]. The FFNs in this study are composed of FHN neurons, which is a simplification of the famous Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model. An FHN has essential neuronal properties such as a threshold and refractoriness, and can describe the qualitative response of an excitable neuron to input stimuli. As shown in Fig. 1, an FFN is constructed of 200 FHN neurons in each layer without recurrent or feedback connections between layers. The neurons in each layer receive synaptic currents from the previous layer, and transmit their spikes to the neurons in the next layer through synaptic connections. There are also no couplings between neurons of the same layer. The network model is described as follows:
Here, the layer indices are i=1,2,3…N_{L}, and the neuron indices in each layer are j=1,2,3…N. Moreover, x_{i,j} and y_{i,j} denote the membrane potential and recovery variable of each neuron, respectively, and Ii,jsyn(t) is the total of synaptic current of neuron j in layer i. In the last equation of (1), α(t)=(t/τ)e^{−t/τ}, where τ is the synapse time constant. In addition, Ni,jsyn represents the number of synaptic couplings from (j-1)th layer to ith neuron in jth layer. The synaptic parameters, that is, the coupling strength between neurons g_{syn} and synapse time constant τ are set as g_{syn}=0.08 and τ=0.3, which are large enough to propagate the signal through layers of FFNs. The synaptic reversal potential V_{syn} is used to determine the type of synapse, where all the synapses in this investigation are created as excitatory synapses by setting V_{syn}=0 [14]. The connection probability P between layers is set to 0.1, which means that there are 4000 synaptic connections between adjacent layers. In addition, the summation of Ni,jsyn of the neurons in each layer is identical for all three FFNs.
To study the effects of degree distribution on signal propagation, FFNs with three topological distributions for neuron couplings are created by modifying the connections between neurons. That is, for each of the three topological FFNs, the total number of incoming connections for each layer in the three types of FFN is set the same, but the in-degree and out-degree distributions of the neurons in each layer differ as identical, uniform or exponential distributions. In detail, the uniform distribution is defined with numbers drawn from the standard uniform distribution on the interval [0, 2*P*N], where N is the number of neurons in one layer (here, N=200, P=0.1). Thus, the maximum in-degree distribution allowed in the uniform distribution is 40. The third in-degree distribution of neurons used here is drawn from the exponential distribution with a probability density function as f(x)=λe^{−λx}, and mean of E(x)=1/λ, where λ is set as 1/(P*N). In Fig. 2, we use the mean results of 50 repetitive simulations to show the degree distributions of neurons for three topological structures as the neuronal connections are not fixed between different simulations. Randomness is set for the connections of neurons before each simulation to make the results more reliable, which also leads to variation for in-degree and out-degree of neurons of the latter two FFNs produced each time. Considering that the neuron number in identical distribution is too big (1800) to show it with the same scale as the other two distributions, we use the mean values of nearby degrees to represent the neuron number of a certain degree, which reduces the neuron number in identical distribution obviously. This calculation method is applied to all three distributions in Fig. 2. In addition, it should be mentioned that there are a few differences between the distributions of in-degree and out-degree in each topological structure because we just fix the in-degree of neurons (i.e., for one neuron in a certain layer, the neurons connected to it in the previous layer are fixed before each simulation according to the in-degree distribution of the network, but we have not fixed the output connection of the neuron specially) and the out-degree of neurons are changing along with the changes of in-degree distribution, which is much easier for us to handle both the in-degree and out-degree distributions for each topological structure.
In the FHN neural model, parameter a is a critical parameter that could substantially affect the dynamics of the system. For a single FHN model without inputs and noise, the Andronov-Hopf bifurcation occurs at a≈0.69(ε=0.08 and b=0.45). When a>0.69, the neuron is in the excitable region. When a<0.69, the system has a stable periodic solution. The Canard phenomenon can be observed near a=0.69. Here, we use ε=0.08,a=0.75, and b=0.45 for the neurons to ensure that they are excitable [21].
The synchronization of each layer in an FFN is characterized by average cross correlation parameter K, which is calculated based on the firing times of neurons in one layer as
where K_{j}(δ) represents the firing synchronization of neuron j with other neurons in the same layer, which is calculated as
and K_{j,m}(δ) is defined as
To be specific, we first transform the spiking binary series into a spiking train after dividing the time series into k bins. Parameter δ represents the length of the bins. Then, each element in X is set as 1 or 0 according to the presence of spikes. That is, if there is a spike in the ith bin X, X(i)=1; otherwise, X(i)=0. Finally, the synchronized state is estimated using the value of K, where the layer is more likely to be a synchronized state if the value of K is close to 1. Conversely, the layer is more likely to be a desynchronized state if the value of K is close to 0.
The regularity of interspike intervals (ISI) is used to characterize the temporal features of firing patterns, which is quantified by the sharpness of the ISI distribution R. First, R^{j} is calculated as R^{j}=〈Tqj〉{t}/Var(Tqj), where Tqj is the ISI time series of neuron j. Here, j=1,2,…,N is the index of neurons in one layer of an FFN, and q indicates the number of time intervals in the ISI time series. Moreover, 〈〉{t} denotes the average value over time, and Var(Tqj) denotes the variance of the ISI time series of neuron j. Then, R is obtained by averaging the R^{j} of all neurons in one layer.
To investigate the effects of topologies on the propagation of firing patterns, the number of synaptic connections in each layer is set to be the same for all three FFN topologies, and the connection probability between adjacent layers is also set to be the same. The differences between the three topological structures are the degree distributions of neurons. Moreover, spike trains with a firing rate r_{1} in a Poisson distribution are generated and set as the output of layer 1 for the three FFN topologies.
Figure 3 shows raster plots of the spikes in the representative layers of FFNs, in which the topologies of the neuron connections in Figs. 3(a) through 3(c) correspond to the identical, uniform, and exponential distributions, respectively. For all three distributions, the neurons fire synchronously after the spikes have propagated through several layers, even though the spikes of the neurons in layer 1 of FFNs are irregular. The firing patterns of all three FFN topologies are found to become more synchronous and regular after layer 6. Moreover, fewer firing trains survive in the later layers of the FFN with identical distribution than for FFNs with a uniform distribution or an exponential distribution, and the number of firing trains in the FFN with an exponential distribution is the highest. Considering the similar spike trains of the first layer and the same degree number of neurons in each layer of the FFNs, the topological structure of the networks should play an essential role in modulating the firing patterns of the FFNs.
The effects of topologies on the propagation of firing rates are studied using the three FFNs constructed above. Similarly, the spike trains in a Poisson distribution are set as the output of layer 1 in the FFNs (r_{1}).
The output firing rates of the three FFN topologies corresponding to different input firing rates are shown in Fig. 4, where the mean values and standard deviation for the output firing rate are calculated from 20 simulations (each simulation produces one output firing rate corresponding to different input firing rates). When the input firing rate r_{1} is increased from 10 Hz to 100 Hz, the output firing rate r_{10} of the FFN with an exponential distribution is always the largest, while the output firing rate of the FFN with an identical distribution is always the smallest. Moreover, differences in the output firing rates for the three distributions emerged even when the input firing rate is very small. These results indicate that the sensitivity of the three FFN topologies to an input signal differs, which is induced by the network topologies because the initial neuronal dynamics, input signal, and other network properties are equal. Note that broader in-degree distributions (e.g., the uniform and exponential distributions) mean that more neurons have higher in-degrees than the identical distribution, and neurons with high in-degrees are more likely to fire at a high rate. The frequent and stable firing of these neurons further increases the likelihood that neurons in the next layer will fire. In summary, the neurons with high in-degrees can be viewed as the pacemakers of the FFNs because they cause more neurons that have connections with them to fire, thus leading to a higher firing rate of the network.
To further explore the effects of topology on information transfer in FFNs, the firing rate of each layer in the FFN corresponding to a fixed input firing rate (r_{1}) is calculated, and the mean values and standard deviation of the firing rate from 20 simulations are shown. As shown in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b), the firing rate first decreases, then increases after propagating through several layers in the FFNs. When the input firing rate is 50 Hz, the output firing rate of the FFN with an exponential distribution is larger than the input firing rate [Fig. 5(a)]. The output firing rate of the FFN with a uniform distribution is approximately the same as the input firing rate, and the output firing rate of the FFN with an identical distribution is much smaller than the input firing rate. When the input firing rate is increased to 80 Hz, the output firing rate of the FFN with an exponential or a uniform distribution is much larger than its input firing rates [Fig. 5(b)]. However, the output firing rate of the FFN with an identical distribution is still smaller than the input firing rate, suggesting that it is less sensitive to the input signal. Furthermore, the firing rate of all three FFNs first decreases, then increases, and finally attains a steady state when the signal is propagated through the layers. The variation trend of the firing rate here should be related to the interplay of the network topology and the neuron excitability, where the two aspects jointly determine the variation of firing rates of layers when the signal is propagated in FFNs.
Spiking regularity is one criterion that is used to characterize the temporal regularity of spike trains in FFNs. As shown in Figs. 6(a) and 6(b), the propagation of spiking regularity through the layers of the FFNs is different for the three topologies, including the change in behavior and the final distribution of R corresponding to the output layer. The spiking regularity of the three FFNs is found to tend to increase compared with the regularity of the first layer when the spikes propagate through the layers, where the spiking regularity of the FFN with an exponential distribution has the highest increase and the spiking regularity of the FFN with an identical distribution has the lowest increase of the three FFNs [Fig. 6(a)]. A local maximum in the FFN with the identical distribution appears [Fig. 6(a)], which is caused by the interaction between network topology and neuron excitability. Statically, the increased regularity in layer 3 and 4 of FFN with the identical distribution is related to the changes of ISI of neurons. That is, a relatively increase in the mean ISI values of neurons in the two layers compared with the changes of standard variation of ISI (the results are not shown here). In addition, when the initial firing rate is increased to 80 Hz, the spiking regularity tends to increase even more through the layers [Fig. 6(b)]. Thus, the spiking regularity of the FFNs is intensively dependent on the degree distribution and the initial firing rate of the FFNs.
It is interesting that the spiking regularity of the FFN with an identical distribution is the lowest, although a neural network with the same in-degree and out-degree for each neuron should have a more regular spiking behavior because the neurons receive a more similar input. In fact, FFNs with a broader degree distribution (i.e., an FFN with a uniform or exponential distribution) will have more neurons fire at a high rate, and these neurons play the role of pacemakers in the network. This can further make their postsynaptic neurons fire with a high probability. However, an FFN with the same node degree for each neuron does not have neurons that are firing steadily. This further leads to a lower firing rate and more irregular firings of the postsynaptic neurons than in an FFN with a broader neuron degree distribution.
The firing synchronization (K) of an FFN, which is usually used as a critical criterion for characterizing the spatial coherence of spikes between neurons, is also shown in Figs. 6(c) and 6(d). The firing synchronization of the three FFN topologies is much lower in the first several layers than in the latter layers. It increases obviously after propagation in the middle layers, and attains a stable state in the latter layers. By comparing the K and R values of the three topologies, the sequence of the firing synchronization in output layers for exponential and identical distributions is found to be opposite to their spiking regularity in the three FFNs [Fig. 6(a) versus Fig. 6(c) and Fig. 6(b) versus Fig. 6(d)]. Similarly, the sequences for the K and F values of the output layers in the three FFNs are also found to be opposite [Fig. 5(a) versus Fig. 6(c) and Fig. 5(b) versus Fig. 6(d)], i.e., high firing rates correspond to low firing synchronization and vice versa. These results clarify that the FFN with an identical distribution needs more input stimuli to produce a relatively high firing rate in the output layer compared with the two other distributions because it has a lower firing rate in each layer despite the same input stimuli being given. Moreover, for FFNs with uniform and exponential distributions, it is relatively easier to amplify the input firing rate than it is for the FFN with an identical distribution.
The opposite sequences between the spiking regularity and firing synchronization for three FFN topologies should also be related to the interaction between neuron excitability and network topology. Consider that the FFN with identical distribution has a low firing rate and the in-degrees of neurons are the same as that of each other, the firing times of many neurons are similar to that of each other and the ISI of neurons are relatively long. Neurons with similar firing frequencies are more likely to fire synchronously than neurons with broad distribution for firing times [Fig. 7(a)]. However, it is difficult to determine the corresponding relationship between the firing rate and spiking regularity. When the firing rate of a neuron is high, both the mean value and standard variance of its ISI are lower than that of the neuron with a low firing rate. But the spiking regularity of the two neurons is difficult to compare because it is characterized by the quotient of the two parameters above. To make it clear, the relationship between the spiking regularity of neurons and their firing rates is shown in Fig. 7(b). It can be easily found in layer 6 that the spiking regularity has an increasing trend with the increase of neurons' firing rates of three FFN topologies, which further leads to the increasing sequences for their mean spiking regularity. Thus, these results suggest that the opposite sequence for the firing synchronization and spiking regularity of the output layer in three FFN topologies are related to the firing rate of the networks (Figs. 5, 6, and 7).
Checkerboard maps are used to show the detailed changes in the three criteria, where each color in the map corresponds to the value of a certain criterion (Fig. 8). Here, r_{1} represents the firing rate of layer 1. As shown in Figs. 8(a) to 8(c), the firing rate in the FFNs with all three topologies first decreases from the initial input firing rate, then increases gradually with the number of layers, and finally attains a stable state in the latter layers. The firing rate in the output layer of the three FFN topologies is easily found to differ despite the same spiking trains being set in the input layer. The output firing rate of the FFN with an exponential distribution is the largest, and the output firing rate of the FFN with an identical distribution is the smallest. However, the sequence of firing synchronization for the FFNs of all three topologies is opposite to the sequence of firing rates, where the FFN with the identical distribution has the highest firing synchronization and the firing synchronizations of the FFNs with the uniform and exponential distributions are lower in sequence [Figs. 8(d)–8(f)]. Interestingly, the spiking regularity in Figs. 8(g) to 8(i) tends to increase in the output layers with the changes of network topology in sequence, which is similar to the firing rate behavior but opposite to the firing synchronization behavior. The difference between the change in behavior of spiking regularity and firing rate is that there is no local minimum in the value of R when it is propagated through the layers.
The node degree is also an important criterion for characterizing the effects of the topology distribution on signal propagation and processing in FFNs, which can be split into the in-degree and out-degree for each neuron. Because the presynaptic neurons can directly influence the spikes of postsynaptic neurons, only the effects of the in-degree of neurons on signal propagation in FFNs are shown here. Figure 9 shows the firing rate of three representative layers in the FFNs corresponding to the in-degrees of neurons for the three topologies. Clearly, the distribution of the in-degree plays an essential role in influencing the firing rate of the neurons as well as the network. When the in-degrees of the neurons are set as identical distribution, the variance of the firing rate decreases as the layer index increases. When the in-degree distribution is uniform or exponential, a corresponding relationship between the firing rate and in-degree for each neuron is found in the front layers (i.e., layers 2 and 4), where neurons with high in-degrees often have a high firing rate, and the distribution of the firing rate is broader. However, in the latter layers (i.e., layer 6), the relationship between the firing rate and in-degree of each neuron almost disappears, that is, there is not an obvious difference between the firing rate of neurons with high and low in-degrees when the in-degree is larger than 10. This should be related to the synchronous firing state of neurons which can modulate their synaptic current to postsynaptic neurons in the next layer, i.e., the rhythmic firing patterns in later layers of an FFN have a constraint or facilitative effect on the firing rates of neurons due to the difference of node degrees, leading to uniform firing frequencies for the individual neurons of later layers. Furthermore, note that all neurons are firing in layer 6 of an FFN with identical distribution.
The relationship between the in-degree and spiking regularity R of each neuron in different layers of the FFNs is also investigated for all three topologies. As Fig. 10 shows, almost all of the neurons in the FFNs fire when the in-degree is larger than 15. The in-degree of each neuron in the FFN with an identical distribution causes the spiking regularity of neurons to be more concentrated after the firing signal is propagated through the layers, and this result is similar to the changes in spiking regularity in the FFNs with uniform and exponential distributions. In addition, most of the neurons' spiking activities in FFNs with exponential distribution are more regular than those of FFNs with uniform distribution. That is, a broad degree distribution of neurons can lead to the increase of the mean spiking regularity of the network, but it does not cause an obvious increase or decrease in the spiking regularity of each neuron. Because the spiking regularity of neurons is related to their ISI distributions, in which the in-degree and out-degree of each neuron play a major role in the spiking regularity in the front layers, but the mean firing rate of the network will become the main effect on the spiking regularity during its propagation in the latter layers (Figs. 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10).
The topology, or node degree distribution of neurons in a neural network, which widely exists in real cerebral cortexes, plays an essential role in neuronal signal propagation [20,22]. It can influence the synchronizability [23,24] and sensitivity of networks to an input signal [25,26].
In our investigation, it is found that the node degree distribution can modulate the firing patterns and firing rates in FFNs. The relationships between signal propagation and three node degree distributions (identical, uniform, and exponential distributions) are investigated in detail. Synchronous spike trains are observed in the latter layers of the three FFNs, and the amount of them in the output layer is strongly related to the node degree distributions of the neurons in the FFNs. When the node degree distribution of the neurons in the FFN is exponential, the firing rate in the output layer is much larger than it is for the two other distributions, and the firing rate in the output layer of the FFN with an identical distribution is the smallest. However, the order of firing synchronization in output layers of the three FFNs is opposite to that of the firing rates, i.e., the firing synchronization in the output layers of the three FFNs goes from more synchronous to less synchronous in the order of identical, uniform, and exponential node degree distributions. Thus, our study suggests that FFNs with broader node degree distributions correspond to higher firing rates and lower firing synchronization. Recently, one investigation showed that the broader in-degree distribution of excitatory connections can promote oscillations although the network structure (a network with recurrent connections) was different from ours [27]. The similarity for the two networks is that they all have broader in-degree distributions, which can make more neurons fire at relatively high rates and lead to an increased mean firing rate for the network. There are also investigations that have shown that the connectivity distribution statistics can significantly influence network synchronization [24], but this study also has differences with respect to ours. The investigation above changes the network structure by modulating the distribution of rewired connections in a small-world network, and it finds that the long-tail distribution of rewired connections (such as an exponential distribution) can result in high firing synchronization. However, the connectivity distribution statistics of the FFN here refers to the in-degree distribution of the neurons, which is different from the distribution of the rewired connections. Furthermore, the synchronization mechanism is also different because of their network structures, in which the recurrent connections in a small-world network can play a key role in the collective activity of the network [28].
The propagation of temporal regularity in the layers of FFNs is also found to be correlated with the in-degree distribution of the neurons. Synaptic currents from the previous layers determine neuronal spike timing, and the amount of current is strongly affected by the node degree distribution of each neuron. Thus, the difference of the node degree distribution of the neurons leads to different spiking regularity in the three FFN topologies. When the node degree distribution of the neurons is identical, the FFN is not sensitive to the input stimuli and each neuron in the FFN needs more excitation to fire than in networks with the two other distributions (Fig. 4). When the node degree distribution is uniform, the sensitivity of the network to the input signal and output firing rate increases (Fig. 4). When the node degree distribution is exponential, the network is much more sensitive to the input signal because more neurons with a high in-degree act as pacemakers in the FFN, which makes their postsynaptic neurons fire with a higher probability (Fig. 4). Therefore, the same input signal can result in different firing regularity due to the node degree distribution of the neurons in an FFN. Several investigations have found that broader in-degree distributions could increase the firing regularity of the network [29,30]. It is shown that the broad in-degree distribution increases the mean firing rate of the network and leads to high regular firing activities of the network, which is consistent with our observations. But there exist several differences between their mechanisms and ours, as their networks are composed of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons with recurrent connections, while our networks are purely excitatory and feed-forward.
The degree distribution has been widely studied in complex networks. However, there are differences between our study and others. First, there are few studies about the degree distribution in FFNs. In Ref [7], the effects of the node degree on signal propagation are investigated with a randomly connected network and small-world network. In Ref [8], the node degree in a randomly connected network is studied by changing the connection probability between neurons. Thus, their network structures are different than ours. Second, previous investigations of signal propagation in FFNs focus on the effects of background activity or the initial dynamics of neurons [4,14,24], where the mechanism of these factors should be different from that of degree distribution. The node degree changes the signal propagation in FFN by modulating the synaptic currents according to the distribution of the in-degrees and out-degrees of neurons. The initial dynamics of neurons, which can selectively determine the spike time of a neuron, are regarded as a neuronal property that regulates the neuron activities. Background noise can influence signal propagation in an FFN through coherence or stochastic resonance, where its intensity is preserved as an effect of the in-degree of the neurons [4]. However, the interaction mechanism is different among the three factors. In contrast to the change in background activity of an FFN, different degree distributions modulate the sensitivity of a network to signal propagation through the network structure.
In conclusion, this study enables us to understand the effects of three FFN topologies on signal propagation. The findings in this paper may be significant for signal transmission in neural networks because it clarifies that the node degree distribution can modulate the firing synchronization and spiking regularity of neurons in FFNs. The effects of the initiation dynamics of neurons [31], synaptic plasticity [16,32], and effects of endogenous fields [33] together with the degree distributions will be explored in future studies.
