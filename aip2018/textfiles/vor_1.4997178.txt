Thermal properties of graphene from path-integral simulations
Thermal properties of graphene monolayers are studied by path-integral molecular dynamics simulations, which take into account the quantization of vibrational modes in the crystalline membrane and allow one to consider anharmonic effects in these properties. This system was studied at temperatures in the range from 12 to 2000 K and zero external stress, by describing the interatomic interactions through the LCBOPII effective potential. We analyze the internal energy and specific heat and compare the results derived from the simulations with those yielded by a harmonic approximation for the vibrational modes. This approximation turns out to be rather precise up to temperatures of about 400 K. At higher temperatures, we observe an influence of the elastic energy due to the thermal expansion of the graphene sheet. Zero-point and thermal effects on the in-plane and “real” surface of graphene are discussed. The thermal expansion coefficient α of the real area is found to be positive at all temperatures, in contrast to the expansion coefficient α_{p} of the in-plane area, which is negative at low temperatures and becomes positive for T≳1000 K.
I. INTRODUCTION
Graphene has been extensively studied in the last few years, not only for its remarkable electronic properties [1–3] but also for other features such as elastic and thermal properties. In fact, graphene displays high values of thermal conductivity [4–6] as well as large in-plane elastic constants [7]. The optimum structural arrangement for pure defect-free graphene corresponds to a honeycomb lattice, but departures from this flat structure may significantly affect both its atomic-scale and macroscopic properties [8].
There are several reasons for a graphene sheet to bend and depart from absolute planarity, such as the presence of defects and external stresses [9,10]. For a perfect two-dimensional (2D) crystalline layer in three-dimensional (3D) space, thermal fluctuations at finite temperatures cause out-of-plane motion of the carbon atoms, and even for T→0, quantum fluctuations associated with zero-point motion yield a departure of strict planarity of the graphene sheet [11].
Understanding structural and thermal properties of 2D systems in 3D space is a challenge in modern statistical physics [12–14]. This question has been mainly treated in connection with biological membranes and soft condensed matter [14–16]. However, the large complexity of these systems has limited the development of microscopic approaches based on realistic interatomic interactions. Graphene, as a well-characterized crystalline membrane, can be considered as a model system where an atomistic description is possible, paving the path to a better understanding of the physical properties of this kind of system. In this line, the interest on thermal properties of graphene has risen in the last few years [17–21], as is the case of thermal expansion and heat conduction, which have been recently studied both experimentally and theoretically [6,18,22–25].
Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations have been employed to study finite-temperature properties of graphene. These simulations were based on ab initio [26–28], tight-binding [29–32], and empirical interatomic potentials [9,33–36]. In most cases, carbon atoms were described as classical particles, which are reliable at relatively high temperatures (in the order of the Debye temperature of the material) but are not suitable to study thermodynamic variables at low temperatures. To take into account the quantum nature of the atomic motion, path-integral simulations are well-suited since in this procedure, nuclear degrees of freedom may be quantized, allowing one to include quantum and thermal fluctuations in many-body systems at finite temperatures [37,38]. Thus, path-integral simulations of a single graphene layer have been recently carried out to study equilibrium properties of this material [11,39]. In addition to this, nuclear quantum effects have been studied earlier by using a combination of density-functional theory and a quasi-harmonic approximation for vibrational modes in this crystalline membrane [40,41].
In this paper, the path-integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) method is used to study thermal properties of graphene at temperatures between 12 and 2000 K. Simulation cells of different sizes are considered, as finite-size effects have been found earlier to be important for some equilibrium properties of graphene [11,36,42]. We study the thermal behavior of the graphene surface, taking into account the difference between the real surface and projected in-plane area. Particular emphasis is laid on the temperature dependence of the specific heat at low T, for which results of the simulations are compared with predictions based on harmonic vibrations of the crystalline membrane.
The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we describe the computational method employed in the simulations. Results for the internal energy of graphene are given in Sec. III. Structural properties such as the in-plane and real area are discussed in Sec. IV. In Sec. V, we present results for the specific heat, and in Sec. VI we summarize the main results.
II. COMPUTATIONAL METHOD
In this paper, we use PIMD simulations to study equilibrium properties of graphene monolayers as a function of temperature. The PIMD method is based on the path-integral formulation of statistical mechanics [43], which has turned out to be a convenient nonperturbative approach to study the finite-temperature properties of many-body quantum systems. In this method, the partition function is evaluated through a discretization of the density matrix along cyclic paths formed by a finite number N_{Tr} (Trotter number) of steps [43,44]. In actual applications of this procedure to numerical simulations, this discretization causes the appearance of N_{Tr} replicas (or beads) for each quantum particle. These replicas are treated in the calculations as classical particles since the partition function of the real quantum system is isomorphic to that of a classical one obtained by substituting each quantum particle by a ring polymer composed of N_{Tr} particles [37,38]. The dynamics in this procedure is artificial, as it does not reflect the real quantum dynamics of the actual particles. Nevertheless, it is useful for effectively sampling the many-body configuration space, yielding accurate results for time-independent equilibrium properties of the quantum system under consideration. Details on this simulation technique can be found elsewhere [37,38,45,46].
An important point for this kind of simulation is a reliable description of the interatomic interactions, which has to be as realistic as possible. We obtain a Born-Oppenheimer surface for the nuclear dynamics from the LCBOPII effective potential [47], as using an ab initio method would largely reduce the size of the simulation cells to be handled. This is a long-range carbon bond order potential, which has been used to perform classical simulations of carbon-based systems, such as diamond [47], graphite [47], liquid carbon [48], and more recently graphene [9,36,49]. It has been used, in particular, to study the carbon phase diagram including graphite, diamond, and liquid carbon and display its accuracy in a comparison of the predicted graphite-diamond line with experimental results [50]. The LCBOPII potential has also been found to describe well several properties of graphene, such as Young’s modulus [49,51,52]. In line with earlier simulations [11,34,52], the original LCBOPII parameterization was slightly modified to increase the zero-temperature bending constant from 1.1 eV to a more realistic value of 1.49 eV [53]. This effective potential has been recently employed to carry out PIMD simulations, which allowed us to quantify the magnitude of quantum effects in graphene monolayers by comparing with the results of classical simulations [11].
The calculations presented here have been carried out in the isothermal-isobaric ensemble, where one fixes the number of carbon atoms (N), the applied stress (here P = 0), and the temperature (T). The stress P, with units of force per unit length, coincides with the so-called mechanical or frame tension τ in several papers [52,54,55]. For comparison, some PIMD simulations were also carried out with constant projected area A_{p} in the reference (x, y) plane. This ensemble is similar to the NVT ensemble employed for simulations of 3D materials, V being the volume. We used effective algorithms for performing PIMD simulations, as those described in the literature [56–59]. In particular, we employed staging variables [60] to define the bead coordinates, and the constant-temperature ensemble was generated by coupling chains of four Nosé-Hoover thermostats [61,62]. For the isothermal-isobaric simulations, an additional chain of four barostats was coupled to the area A_{p} of the simulation box to give the required constant stress (here P = 0) [46,57]. The equations of motion were integrated by using the reversible reference system propagator algorithm (RESPA) that allows one to deal with different time steps for the integration of the fast and slow degrees of freedom [63]. The time step Δt associated with the interatomic forces was taken in the range between 0.5 and 1 fs, which turned out to be adequate for the interatomic interactions, atomic masses, and temperatures considered here. More details on this kind of PIMD simulation are given elsewhere [57,64,65].
We consider rectangular simulation cells with similar side lengths L_{x} and L_{y} in the x and y directions of the (x, y) reference plane, and periodic boundary conditions were assumed. Sampling of the configuration space has been carried out at temperatures between 12 K and 2000 K. The Trotter number N_{Tr} was taken proportional to the inverse temperature (N_{Tr}∝1/T) so that N_{Tr}T = 6000 K, which turns out to roughly keep a constant precision in the PIMD results at different temperatures [64–66]. Cells of size up to 33 600 atoms were considered for simulations at T≥ 300 K, and at lower temperatures, smaller cells were considered due to the fast increase in the number of beads N_{Tr} for the carbon atoms. Given a temperature, a typical simulation run consisted of 3×10^{5} PIMD steps for system equilibration, followed by 6×10^{6} steps for the calculation of ensemble average properties.
III. INTERNAL ENERGY
At T = 0, we find with the LCBOPII potential in a classical approach a strictly planar graphene surface with an interatomic distance of 1.4199 Å, i.e., an area of 2.6189 Å^{2}/atom, which we call A_{0}. This corresponds to a graphene sheet with fixed atomic nuclei on their equilibrium sites without spatial delocalization, giving the minimum energy E_{0}, taken as a reference for our calculations at finite temperatures. In a more realistic quantum approach, the low-temperature limit includes out-of-plane atomic fluctuations associated with zero-point motion, and the graphene layer is not strictly planar. In addition to this, anharmonicity of in-plane vibrations causes a small zero-point lattice expansion, yielding an interatomic distance of 1.4287 Å, i.e., about 1% larger than the classical minimum.
At P = 0, the internal energy E is obtained as a sum of the kinetic and potential energies obtained from the simulations at a given temperature. The kinetic energy was calculated by using the virial estimator [57,67], which is known to have a statistical uncertainty smaller than the potential energy of the system.
Since we are interested in the large-size (thermodynamic) limit of the variables considered here, it is important to reduce as much as possible the finite-size effects associated with them. Thus, we have corrected for the center-of-mass translational energy, a classical magnitude amounting to E_{CM} = 3k_{B}T/2 at temperature T, and that is usually neglected as an unimportant quantity in this context. When considering the energy per atom, this quantity becomes irrelevant for large systems, but in general, one has to include it to accelerate the convergence of the internal energy per atom with system size. Then, we have added 3k_{B}T/2N to the internal energy per atom obtained in PIMD simulations.
In our simulations of graphene, both kinetic and potential energies were found to slightly increase with system size, but their convergence is rather fast. In Fig. 1, we present the internal energy per atom derived from PIMD simulations as a function of cell size at three temperatures: 200 K (squares), 50 K (circles), and 12.5 K (diamonds). At the lowest temperature, there appears a shift of about 4 meV/atom when increasing the cell size from 8 atoms to the largest sizes considered here. For cells in the order of 200 atoms, the size effect in the internal energy is almost inappreciable when compared with the largest cells. The potential energy was found earlier to be smaller than the kinetic energy, indicating a non-negligible anharmonicity of the lattice vibrations [11]. The convergence with system size becomes faster as the temperature is raised. This is basically due to the fact that increasing the cell size effectively causes the appearance of low vibrational frequencies in the system that do not appear for smaller sizes. Increasing the temperature makes these new low-frequency modes behave “more classically” (see Sec. V A).
In Fig. 2, we display the temperature dependence of the internal energy, as derived from PIMD in the NPT isothermal-isobaric ensemble, for system size N = 240. For comparison, we also present results obtained from constant-A_{p} simulations with fixed area A_{p} = A_{0}. The zero-point energy, E_{ZP}, is found to be close to 0.17 eV/atom in both cases. In the isobaric simulations, however, E_{ZP} is somewhat lower than that in the fixed-A_{p} simulations, mainly due to the zero-point expansion of the graphene layer with respect to the classical minimum A_{0}. This expansion relaxes the compressive stress appearing for area A_{0} in the presence of atomic quantum motion, and consequently the energy decreases. The difference between zero-point energy in both cases amounts to 1 meV/atom. This difference between both sets of results decreases for rising temperature, and eventually the constant-area energy becomes lower than the P = 0 result for T≳ 1000 K (not shown in the figure).
To better appreciate the low-temperature region, we present in Fig. 3 the temperature dependence of the internal energy obtained from PIMD simulations in the NPT ensemble up to T∼ 100 K. Symbols indicate results of the simulations for N = 240 (solid circles) and N = 960 (open circles). Note that several solid circles are nearly unobservable, as they lie under the results for 960 atoms. The solid line is a fit to the expression E = E_{ZP} + aT^{2} + bT^{3}, which displays a good agreement with the temperature dependence of the energy in the region shown in Fig. 3. For the coefficients a and b, we found a=7.1×10^{−8} eV K^{−2} and b=2.7×10^{−10} eV K^{−3}. Note that a linear term in this expression for the internal energy is not possible for thermodynamic consistency since the specific heat c_{p}=(∂E/∂T){P} has to vanish for T→0. In Fig. 3, we also present separately the contributions of the T^{2} and T^{3} terms (dashed lines). The T^{2} term is the main contribution to the energy in the considered region and controls the temperature dependence of the energy up to about 40 K. This is important for the low-temperature specific heat and will be further discussed in Sec. V.
IV. STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES
In our simulations in the isothermal-isobaric ensemble, one fixes the applied stress in the (x, y) plane (here P = 0), allowing changes in the in-plane area of the simulation cell for which periodic boundary conditions are applied. Carbon atoms are free to move in the out-of-plane direction (z coordinate), and in general, any measure of the “real” surface of a graphene sheet at T>0 should give a value larger than the area of the simulation cell in the (x, y) plane. In this line, it has been argued for biological membranes that their properties should be described using the concept of a real surface instead of a “projected” (in-plane) surface [15,68,69]. A similar question can be risen for crystalline membranes such as graphene. This may be relevant for calculating thermodynamic properties since the in-plane area A_{p} is the variable conjugate to the stress P used in our simulations, and the real area (also called true, effective, or actual area in the literature [15,54,68,69]) is a conjugate to the usually called surface tension [12]. It is, in fact, the in-plane area A_{p} which has been commonly employed in the literature to describe the results of atomistic simulations of graphene layers [15,36,39,42,49]. In the framework of biological membranes, it was shown that values of the compressibility may be very different when they are related to A or to A_{p}, and something similar has been recently found for the elastic properties of graphene [52].
Here we calculate a real area A in 3D space by a triangulation based on the actual atomic positions. Each structural hexagon contributes to the area A by a sum of six triangles, each one formed by the positions of two adjacent C atoms and the centroid (barycenter) of the hexagon (mean position of the corresponding six vertices) [52]. Other, qualitatively similar, definitions can be used for the real area, such as those based on the interatomic distance C–C [11,70]. In Fig. 4, we show the temperature dependence of the in-plane area A_{p} and the real area A of graphene, as derived from PIMD simulations, in a semilogarithmic plot. For A_{p}, we present results for various cell sizes as solid symbols. From top to bottom: N = 96 (diamonds), 240 (circles), 960 (squares), and 33 600 (triangles). Open circles represent results for the area A obtained with N = 240 atoms; results for larger cells are indistinguishable from them. In fact, A shows, in contrast to A_{p}, a small finite-size effect not visible at the scale of Fig. 4. The horizontal dashed line in Fig. 4 indicates the minimum-energy area A_{0}, corresponding to a planar classical sheet at T = 0.
For the area A, one observes a nearly constant value up to about 200 K, followed by an increase at higher temperatures, similar to that observed for the volume of 3D crystalline solids such as diamond [71]. The in-plane area A_{p} decreases in the range from T = 0 to temperatures in the order of 1000 K, where it reaches a minimum, and then it increases at higher T. Here, the finite-size effect is important in both the temperature T_{m} of the minimum and the value of the minimum area. For rising system size, the temperature T_{m} shifts to higher values, whereas the minimum A_{p} decreases with increasing N. These results for the in-plane area are reminiscent of those found from classical Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations of graphene [39,42,49], but in PIMD simulations, we find a more pronounced decrease in A_{p} in the temperature region from 0 to 1000 K.
In the limit T→0, the areas A and A_{p} converge to 2.6459 Å^{2} and 2.6407 Å^{2}, respectively. It is important to note that in spite of the appreciable differences in the in-plane area per atom for the different system sizes, all of them converge at low T to the same value. In the low-temperature region, one first observes a zero-point expansion of about 0.02 Å^{2} (∼1%), mainly due to an increase in the mean C–C bond length, caused by zero-point vibrations (an anharmonic effect). The small differenc of 0.2% between real and in-plane areas is associated with out-of-plane zero-point motion, which is the reason that even at T = 0 the layer is not strictly planar. Note that this is a pure quantum effect since in classical simulations at T→0, one finds a planar layer in which A and A_{p} coincide [11,52].
Moreover, the temperature T_{m} at which A_{p} reaches its minimum is size-dependent (see Fig. 4). In Fig. 5, we present the dependence of T_{m} on system size. Solid symbols indicate results of PIMD, and the solid line is a polynomial fit to the data points. It has been shown earlier from extensive classical simulations that the in-plane area A_{p} has an important finite-size effect, but its large-N limit is well defined [34,36]. Something similar is expected for the results of PIMD simulations and in particular for the temperature T_{m}. Thus, in the large-N limit, the size-dependent T_{m} converges to a value ≲1200 K. A more precise result for this limit would require consideration of larger system sizes, not accessible at present with our simulation procedure.
Beginning from T = 0, the surface A is larger than A_{p}, and the difference between both increases with temperature. In fact, A_{p} is the projection of A on the (x, y) plane, and the actual surface becomes increasingly bent as the temperature is raised and out-of-plane atomic displacements are larger. For the area A, we do not observe the decrease displayed by A_{p}. Moreover, the areas A and A_{p} derived from PIMD simulations show a temperature derivative which approaches zero as T→0, in agreement with the third law of thermodynamics.
The behavior of A_{p} as a function of T is basically due to a competition between two opposite factors. First, the real area A rises as T is increased in the whole temperature range considered here. Second, bending of the surface gives rise to a decrease in its 2D projection, A_{p}. At T≲1000 K, the decrease due to out-of-plane vibrations dominates the thermal expansion of the real surface so that dA_{p}/dT<0. At T≳1000 K, the increase in A dominates the contraction in the projected area associated with out-of-plane atomic displacements. This behavior is qualitatively similar to that found from classical molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations, as well as analytical calculations, where a minimum in the temperature dependence of A_{p} was also found [11,42,49,72]. The main difference is that the contraction of A_{p} with respect to the zero-temperature value is in the quantum case significantly larger than for classical calculations.
According to our definitions of the areas A and A_{p}, we consider two different thermal expansion coefficients
and
The area A derived from our PIMD simulations shows a negligible size effect for N≳100 atoms, as indicated above. Hence, the same occurs for the coefficient α that vanishes in the zero-temperature limit and turns out to be positive at all finite temperatures considered here. In Fig. 6, we display the thermal expansion coefficients α and α_{p} derived from our simulations. Symbols are data points obtained from a numerical derivative of the areas A (squares) and A_{p} (circles) corresponding to N = 960. For these derivatives, we took temperature intervals ranging from 10 K at low temperatures to about 100 K at temperatures higher than 1000 K. To check the precision of these numerical derivatives, we fitted the obtained values for A and A_{p} to polynomial expressions in the temperature range from T = 10 to 1500 K. We then obtained the temperature derivative of these polynomials, which yielded the solid lines displayed in Fig. 6. The agreement between both procedures for calculating α and α_{p} is good. Note that the noise in the values of α_{p} obtained from numerical differences is clearly larger than that found for α, as a consequence of the larger fluctuations in A_{p}.
Both α and α_{p} converge to zero in the low-temperature limit. The behavior of α is similar to that observed for crystalline materials, as indicated above for the temperature dependence of the area A. However, α_{p} decreases fast for increasing temperature, until reaching a minimum, which for N = 960 amounts to ≈−9×10^{−6} K^{−1} at T_{m}∼ 200 K. At higher T, α_{p} rises and becomes positive at a temperature of about 1000 K (where A_{p} reaches its minimum value). In view of the results for A_{p} displayed in Fig. 4, the minimum value of α_{p} is expected to be size-dependent. Analyzing the results for the different system sizes studied here, we estimate in the large-size limit a minimum value α_{p}=−1.1(±0.1)×10^{−5} K^{−1}. It is interesting to note that the difference α−α_{p}, which vanishes at T = 0, increases fast as the temperature is raised, and takes a value ≈10^{−5} K^{−1} for temperatures higher than 1000 K.
Our results for α_{p} are qualitatively similar to those derived earlier from other theoretical techniques. Jiang et_al [73] employed a nonequilibrium Green’s function approach and found for free-standing graphene a minimum ≈10^{−5} K^{−1}, close to our data shown in Fig. 6. They found a crossover from negative to positive α_{p} at a temperature T≈600 K, lower than our PIMD results. Such a crossover at a point with α_{p}=0 was obtained by da Silva et_al [24] at T≈ 400 K from an unsymmetrized self-consistent-field method. Experimental results at room temperature are not far from our data at 300 K: α_{p}=−8×10^{−6} K^{−1} derived from Raman spectroscopy results [74] and −7×10^{−6} K^{−1} found from scanning electron microscopy [75]. The consistency between different measurements is not so good for the temperature dependence of α_{p}, and in fact the increase in α_{p} at T>300 K is much faster in the former case [74] than in the latter [75].
To make a connection of our results derived from atomistic simulations with analytical formulations of membranes, we note that the relation between A and A_{p} can be expressed in the continuum limit (macroscopic view) as [52,68,69]
where h(x, y) is the height of the membrane surface, i.e., the distance to the reference (x, y) plane. The difference between the expansion coefficients α and α_{p} at high temperature can be understood from the relation between real and projected areas, A and A_{p}, given by this equation.
In fact, the difference A − A_{p} for a continuous membrane in a classical approach may be calculated by the Fourier transformation of the rhs of Eq. (3) [12,15,52]. This requires the introduction of a dispersion relation ω(k) for out-of-plane modes (ZA band), where k = (k_{x}, k_{y}) are the 2D wavevectors. The frequency dispersion in this acoustic (flexural) band can be well approximated by the expression ρω^{2}=σk^{2}+κk^{4}, consistent with an atomic description of graphene [34] (k = |k|; ρ—surface mass density; σ—effective stress; κ—bending modulus). Thus, one finds [52]
with the wavevector cutoff k_{m}=(2π/Ap){1/2}.
For effective stress σ>0, which is the case at finite temperatures, even for zero external stress (P = 0) [34,52], the integral in Eq. (4) converges, yielding
Note that this expression has been derived in the classical limit, i.e., without taking into account atomic quantum delocalization. It is expected, however, to be a good approximation to our quantum calculations at relatively high temperature, T≳Θ_{D}, with Θ_{D}∼ 1000 K as the Debye temperature associated with out-of-plane vibrations in graphene [76,77].
It is not straightforward to write down an analytical expression for α−α_{p} from a temperature derivative of Eq. (5), as one has to include changes in κ and σ through ∂κ/∂T and ∂σ/∂T. One can instead obtain the temperature dependence of these parameters from a fit to earlier results of classical simulations [34]. Thus, we obtain from Eq. (5) at T = 1000 K a difference α−α_{p}=8.5×10^{−6} K^{−1}, close to the high-temperature results obtained from our PIMD simulations (∼10^{−5} K^{−1}).
Our low-temperature data for A_{p}(T) and the trend α_{p}→0 in the low-temperature limit are consistent with the results obtained by Amorim et_al [17] from first-order perturbation theory and a one-loop self-consistent approximation. These authors emphasized that the limits N→∞ and T→0 do commute, which agrees with the results of our simulations, i.e., at low T, all system sizes yield the same results. In general, the evaluation of low-temperature properties from PIMD simulations becomes increasingly harder for both larger N and lower T. In the case of graphene, this is complicated by the fact that larger sizes may require lower temperatures to converge to the ground-state properties, as shown for the area A_{p} in Fig. 4.
V. SPECIFIC HEAT
A. Harmonic approximation
For comparison with the results of our PIMD simulations for the specific heat of graphene, we will discuss here a harmonic approximation (HA) for the lattice vibrations. Even though this approximation will turn out to be rather accurate at low temperatures, it is clear that anharmonicity will show up as the temperature is raised, and the results of this approximation will progressively depart from those more realistic derived from the simulations. The HA assumes constant frequencies for the graphene vibrations (those derived for the minimum-energy configuration) and does not take into account changes of the areas A and A_{p} with temperature. For solids, volume changes are usually considered through quasi-harmonic approximations, which take into account the thermal expansion and its corresponding changes in vibrational frequencies (usually by means of Grüneisen constants [40,66,78]). The same procedure is not directly applicable for graphene at any temperature, as due to the compression of A_{p}, the crystalline membrane becomes unstable in a quasi-harmonic approximation for A_{p}<A_{0} with the appearance of imaginary frequencies when diagonalizing the dynamical matrix. This can be remedied at low temperatures for finite-size graphene layers, but the whole scheme becomes unstable at relatively high T or yields unphysical results, as a continuous contraction of graphene at any temperature [40], in disagreement with results of both classical and PIMD simulations [11,36,42,49,72].
For a simulation cell including N atoms, the specific heat per atom, c_{v}(T) = dE(T)/dT, is given in the HA by
where β=1/(k_{B}T), and the index r (r = 1, …, 6) refers to the six phonon bands of graphene (ZA, ZO, LA, TA, LO, and TO) [40,79,80]. The sum in k is extended to wavevectors k = (k_{x}, k_{y}) in the hexagonal Brillouin zone, with discrete k points spaced by Δk_{x}=2π/L_{x} and Δk_{y}=2π/L_{y} [34]. Equation (6) has been used to calculate the specific heat presented below. Increasing the system size N causes the appearance of vibrational modes with longer wavelength λ. In fact, one has for the phonons an effective cutoff λ_{max}≈L, with L = (NA_{p})^{1/2}, and the minimum wavevector is k_{0}=2π/λ_{max}, i.e., k_{0}∼N^{−1/2}.
The low-temperature behavior of the heat capacity vs T can be further analyzed by considering a continuous model for frequencies and wavevectors, similarly to the well-known Debye model for solids [78,81]. At low-temperatures, c_{v} is dominated by the contribution of acoustic modes with small k. For graphene, these are TA and LA modes with ω_{r}∝k and ZA modes with ω_{r}∝k^{2} (σ is negligible at low T and zero external stress).
The low-T contribution of a phonon branch with the dispersion relation ω_{r}∝k^{n} can be approximated as
where k_{m} is the maximum wavenumber k_{m}=(2π/A0){1/2} and ρ(k)=A_{0}k/2π for 2D systems. From the dispersion relation ω_{r}(k), we have a vibrational density of states ρ¯{r}(ω)∼ω^{2n−1} Introducing the large-size limit ω_{0}→0 and substituting x=12βℏω, one finds
K being a constant. Then, for low temperatures, k_{B}T≪ℏω_{m}, one has cvr∼T^{2/n}. In general, for d-dimensional systems, one finds an exponent d/n [82,83]. Thus, for the ZA phonon branch in graphene (n = 2), one expects a linear dependence of cvr on T, whereas for the contribution of LA and TA branches (n = 1), one has at low temperatures cvr∼T^{2}. Substituting all constants in the integrals, we find for the ZA branch
and for acoustic LA and TA modes
v being the sound velocity in the corresponding phonon branch, and ζ is the Riemann zeta function.
For in-plane vibrations of graphene, the acoustic branches can be described by the linear dispersion ω_{i}=v_{i}k, with sound speed v_{1} = 21.5 km/s for LA and v_{2} = 14.0 km/s for TA modes. These values for v_{1} and v_{2} were derived from the elastic properties of graphene obtained by using the LCBOPII potential [52] and are close to those given by Karssemeijer and Fasolino [79], as well as to those derived from ab initio calculations for graphene [40] and experimental data for graphite [80]. For the bending constant κ describing the ZA phonon band, we take κ = 1.49 eV [34].
B. Elastic energy
Apart from the pure vibrational energy associated with the phonons in graphene, one has even in the presence of an externally applied stress an elastic energy due to changes in the area A of the crystalline membrane (thermal expansion). Thus, the internal energy E(T) at temperature T can be written as [11]
where E_{el}(A) is the elastic energy corresponding to an area A, and E_{vib}(A, T) is the vibrational energy of the system. Our PIMD simulations directly give E(T), which can be split into an elastic and a vibrational part.
The elastic energy E_{el} corresponding to an area A is defined here as the increase in the energy of a strictly planar graphene layer with respect to the minimum energy E_{0}. We have calculated E_{el}(A) for a supercell including 960 atoms, expanding it isotropically and keeping it flat. As indicated above for the area A, finite-size effects on the elastic energy are very small and in practice negligible for our current purposes. The elastic energy E_{el}(A) increases with A, and for small lattice expansion, it can be approximated as E_{el}(A)≈K(A−A0){2}, with K = 2.41 eV/Å^{2}. The elastic energy turns out to be much smaller than the vibrational energy in the cases considered here, but it can be non-negligible for the actual heat capacity of graphene, as the area A changes with temperature.
In Fig. 7, we present the elastic energy E_{el} as a function of temperature for our NPT simulations at P = 0. For comparison, we also show results derived from constant-A_{p} simulations with the minimum-energy area A_{0}. E_{el} is found to increase with T in both cases, but there are some differences between them. In the isothermal-isobaric simulations (circles), we find an appreciable elastic energy in the zero-temperature limit, basically due to the zero-point lattice expansion (see Sec. IV). In the constant-A_{p} simulations (squares), such an expansion is not allowed, and E_{el} is nearly zero; a small positive value of E_{el} is obtained for T→0, caused by a slight increase in the area A due to out-of-plane zero-point vibrations. The difference between the elastic energy in both kinds of simulations decreases from T = 0 until about 1000 K, and then it increases at higher temperatures. This is related to the dependence of the in-plane area in NPT simulations upon temperature, which approaches the area A_{0} up to 1000 K and departs from it at higher T (see Fig. 4).
C. Comparison with PIMD simulations
We now turn to the results of our simulations. In Fig. 8, we show the specific heat of graphene as a function of temperature. Solid circles represent results for c_{p}, derived from PIMD simulations for N = 960 atoms. They were obtained from a numerical derivative of the internal energy E(T). Results corresponding to N = 240 are indistinguishable from those plotted in Fig. 8. The solid line was calculated with the HA using Eq. (6), with the frequencies ω_{r}(k) (r = 1, …, 6) obtained from the diagonalization of the dynamical matrix corresponding to the LCBOPII potential [79]. Results of the simulations follow closely the HA up to about 400 K, and they become progressively higher than the solid line for higher temperatures, at which anharmonic effects are expected to increase.
As indicated above, a part of the internal energy at a given temperature corresponds to the elastic energy E_{el}, i.e., to the cost of increasing the area A of graphene. We have calculated the contribution of this energy to the specific heat as dE_{el}/dT, using the data obtained from PIMD simulations in the NPT ensemble, shown in Fig. 7. To assess the importance of this contribution to the whole specific heat, we have added it to the result of the HA (solid line in Fig. 8) and have displayed the sum as a dashed line. We find an observable increase in the specific heat with respect to the pure HA, especially visible for T>500 K, such that it incorporates part of the anharmonicity of the system, yielding a result closer to the specific heat c_{p} derived from the simulations. For comparison, the classical Dulong-Petit specific heat is shown as a dashed-dotted line (cvcl=3k_{B}). At T = 1000 K, the quantum results are still appreciably lower than the classical limit.
We have also calculated the specific heat c_{v} from constant-A_{p} simulations. For each temperature, we take the equilibrium area A_{p} obtained in the NPT simulations and calculate c_{v} as ΔE/ΔT for that value of A_{p} from increments ΔT (both positive and negative). Note that this is not the same as taking a temperature derivative of the energy curve shown in Fig. 1 for the constant-A_{p} ensemble since in this case, the simulations were carried out with minimum-energy area A_{0}. It is expected that c_{v}≤c_{p} at any temperature, but the difference between them turns out to be smaller than the statistical error bar of our results so that they appear as indistinguishable from the direct results of our PIMD simulations (see below).
An analytical expression for c_{v}(T) at low temperatures can be derived in the HA from the contribution cvr of modes ZA, LA, and TA, as given by Eqs. (9) and (10). The sum of contributions of these three phonon bands is plotted in Fig. 8 as a dashed-dotted line. It follows the simulation data and the whole HA up to T∼ 50 K, and at high temperatures, it becomes lower.
To display more clearly the low-temperature region, we present in Fig. 9 the specific heat vs temperature in a semilogarithmic plot. Solid circles are results for c_{p} derived from PIMD simulations for N = 960. The solid line indicates the harmonic approximation for c_{v} obtained from Eq. (6) for the same cell size. At low temperatures, the linear dependence of the specific heat on T (slope unity in the logarithmic plot) is clear. In fact, we find at low temperatures c_{p}≈CT with C=1.4×10^{−7} eV K^{−2} (note that C = 2a, with a as the coefficient of the quadratic term in the fit of the energy shown in Fig. 3). For comparison, we also present in Fig. 9 the experimental data for c_{p} of graphite obtained by Desorbo and Tyler [84]. The temperature dependence of the heat capacity of graphite has been studied in detail along the years [85–88]. In this case, c_{p} rises as T^{3} for T< 10 K (a region not reached here and not shown in Fig. 9). At temperatures between 10 and 100 K, c_{p} increases as T^{2}. The main difference with graphene is that the dominant contribution to c_{p} in this temperature region comes from phonons with a linear dispersion relation (ω∼k) for small k. At room temperature, the specific heat of graphite amounts to 8.90×10^{−5} eV/K atom, i.e., 8.59 J/K mol, somewhat smaller than our results of PIMD simulations for graphene: c_{p}=9.4(±0.1)×10^{−5} eV/K atom.
The difference between c_{p} and c_{v} has been obtained from the thermodynamic relation
where B_{p} is the in-plane isothermal bulk modulus, i.e., B_{p}=−A_{p}(∂P/∂Ap){T}. Equation (12) is similar to the relation between c_{p} and c_{v} for 3D systems [89,90]. Note that the variables appearing on the rhs of Eq. (12) refer to in-plane properties, as the pressure appearing in our NPT ensemble is the conjugate variable of the in-plane area A_{p}. B_{p} has been calculated by using the fluctuation formula [52,90]
with (ΔAp){2} as the mean-square fluctuations of the in-plane area A_{p} obtained in the simulations. This expression is more convenient for our purposes than obtaining (∂Ap/∂P){T}, as this derivative requires additional simulations at nonzero stresses. In any case, we have checked at some selected temperatures that both procedures yield the same results for B_{p} (taking into account the error bars).
Thus, we have obtained the difference c_{p} − c_{v} introducing into Eq. (12) the values of α_{p}, B_{p}, and A_{p} derived from PIMD simulations. The results are shown in Fig. 10 as a function of temperature (solid circles). The solid line in this figure was obtained by using Eq. (12) and polynomial fits for the temperature dependence of the factors in the rhs of this equation. In the zero-temperature limit, the difference c_{p} − c_{v} converges to zero, as should happen because both specific heats vanish as T→0, and this difference increases for rising temperature until T∼ 300 K, where it reaches a maximum of ≈5.5×10^{−7} eV/(K atom). At higher T, c_{p} − c_{v} decreases and reaches zero at the temperature at which α_{p} vanishes (∼1000 K). Note that the vanishing of the difference c_{p} − c_{v} at a finite temperature (here T∼ 300 K) obtained for graphene is similar to that occurring for some 3D materials with negative thermal expansion at low T (e.g., crystalline silicon) [91,92], according to the thermodynamic equation c_{p}−c_{v}=Tα^{2}BV.
We emphasize here that the calculation of the low-temperature specific heat of materials using path-integral simulations is not in general an easy task. In fact, even the reproduction of the Debye law c_{p}∼T^{3} for 3D solids has been a challenge for the PIMD of solids due to the effective low-frequency cutoff associated with finite simulation cells [93,94]. The reliability of this kind of calculation for 2D materials such as graphene is mainly due to two reasons. First, the length of the cell sides scales as L∼N^{1/d} so that the minimum wavevector accessible in the simulation is k_{0}∼N^{−1/d}. Then, for a simulation cell including N atoms, k_{0} is smaller for 2D than for 3D materials, which means that the low-frequency region is better described in the former case, and consequently also the low-temperature regime. Second, and even more important, is the fact that the internal energy for graphene rises as T^{2} (or c_{p}∼T), which is a fast increase, much easily detectable than the typical expectancy (E∼T^{4}) for the phonon contribution in 3D materials (c_{p}∼T^{3}).
We note that the electronic contribution to the specific heat of graphene has not been taken into account for the temperatures considered here, as it is much less than the phonon contribution. The former has been estimated in several studies and turns out to be between three and four orders of magnitude smaller than the latter in pure graphene [20,95,96].
A thermodynamic parameter related to the thermal expansion and specific heat is the dimensionless Grüneisen parameter γ [78], which for our in-plane variables in graphene can be written as
From the results of our PIMD simulations for N = 960 atoms, we find γ=−2.3 at 300 K, and at 1000 K, γ≈0 within the precision of our numerical results. At room temperature, γ and α_{p} turn out to be negative mainly as a consequence of the negative sign of the mode-dependent Grünesien parameter γ_{ZA} for the out-of-plane ZA vibrations [6,40]. At temperatures in the order of 1000 K, this trend is compensated for by the positive sign of the Grünesien parameters of in-plane modes, which eventually results in the overall γ and α_{p} becoming positive for T> 1000 K.
VI. SUMMARY
We have presented results of PIMD simulations of graphene monolayers in the isothermal-isobaric ensemble at several temperatures and zero external stress. Consideration of quantum dynamics of the atomic nuclei has allowed us to realistically describe structural and thermodynamic properties of graphene at finite temperatures. Such a quantum description is crucial to study thermal properties at temperatures in the order of and below room temperature.
The LCBOPII potential model describes fairly well the vibrational frequencies of graphene. We have shown here that quantum effects associated with vibrational motion are also described in a reliable manner by PIMD simulations using this potential.
We have discussed the fact that the so-called thermal contraction of graphene presented in the literature is in fact a decrease in the in-plane (projected) area A_{p} due to out-of-plane vibrations and not due to a reduction in the real area A of the graphene sheet. The difference A − A_{p} grows as the temperature is raised because of the larger amplitude of those vibrations. The in-plane thermal expansion α_{p} is found to be negative at low temperatures and becomes positive for T≳1000 K. However, the thermal expansion α of the real area turns out to be positive at all finite temperatures.
Anharmonicity of the vibrational modes is appreciable and should be taken into account in any finite-temperature calculation of the properties of graphene. This manifests itself clearly in the temperature dependence of the in-plane and real areas shown in Fig. 4. However, other thermal properties of graphene are well described by the HA once the frequencies of the vibrational modes are known for the classical equilibrium geometry at T = 0. A calculation of the specific heat c_{p} from results of PIMD simulations indicates that anharmonicity shows up progressively at temperatures T≳400 K. In particular, a contribution to the heat capacity, not included in the HA, comes from the elastic energy associated with the expansion of the actual graphene sheet at finite T (α>0). At the lowest temperatures studied here (T> 10 K), we find a linear dependence of the specific heat of graphene c_{p} = CT, with C=1.4×10^{−7} eV K^{−2}.
PIMD simulations similar to those presented here may help us to understand thermal properties of graphane (a hydrogen monolayer on graphene) as well as the dynamics of free-standing graphene multilayers.
