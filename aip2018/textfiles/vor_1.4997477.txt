Parameter dependence of high-frequency nonlinear oscillations and intrinsic chaos in short GaAs/(Al, Ga)As superlattices
We explore the design parameter space of short (5–25 period), n-doped, Ga/(Al,Ga)As semiconductor superlattices (SSLs) in the sequential resonant tunneling regime. We consider SSLs at cool (77 K) and warm (295 K) temperatures, simulating the electronic response to variations in (a) the number of SSL periods, (b) the contact conductivity, and (c) the strength of disorder (aperiodicities). Our analysis shows that the chaotic dynamical phases exist on a number of sub-manifolds of codimension zero within the design parameter space. This result provides an encouraging guide towards the experimental observation of high-frequency intrinsic dynamical chaos in shorter SSLs.
I. INTRODUCTION
Chaotic oscillations in n-doped, weakly coupled semiconductor superlattices (SSLs) have generated interest for many years. Spontaneous oscillations, quasiperiodic orbits, and chaos have already been observed experimentally at very low temperatures [5–7] and at room temperature [8–11,13,18–20] in 50-period SSLs. The sequential resonant tunneling (SRT) model of Bonilla et_al (see reviews in Refs [22] and  [28]) captures the essential physics of tunneling transport in SSLs. The model contains nonlinearities arising from feedback between resonant tunneling through the barriers and the self-consistent electric field of the mobile carriers. Simulations of the 50-period SSLs by Alvaro et_al [15] demonstrated extreme sensitivity to weak stochastic perturbations of the local electric fields and the bias voltage, which provided a qualitative description of the experimental results. However, the unperturbed dynamics of the 50-period SRT model contained only a period doubling bifurcation, rather than fully developed chaos. Recently, it was observed that shorter (10-period) SSLs support chaotic oscillations on much faster timescales [16,17]. In contrast with the 50-period simulations, the chaos in shorter SSLs exhibited a complete period-doubling cascade.
One of the practical applications of chaotic oscillations in SSLs is the secure generation of random bit sequences [1–4]. With faster chaotic oscillations, shorter SSLs would achieve a higher random bit rate. In this work, we provide aid to the experimental search for period-doubling cascades in shorter SSLs by mapping out the response of the SRT model to variations of the basic design parameters.
We simulate the SRT theory, which describes electronic transport in SSLs in the weakly coupled, self-consistent regime. Two different time scales are taken into account in this description: The inter-site tunneling and inter-subband relaxation processes occur on much shorter timescales than the dielectric relaxation processes [23]. Therefore, the long timescale dynamics of semiconductor lasers [12] and superlattices [14,15] are typically modeled using semiclassical equations, while the short timescale processes are treated through the addition of stochastic terms to the dynamical equations. Nonlinearities enter the model via the self-consistent electron-electron Coulomb interaction, which bends the conduction band of the SSL, modifying the inter-subband tunneling rates by casting the energy levels of adjacent wells into or out of resonance [23].
Over some intervals of the bias voltage, the total current J(t) through the SSL is a monotonically increasing function of the bias voltage. At higher bias voltages, J(t) suddenly changes to a time-dependent, oscillatory function, which undergoes a series of transitions, leading to chaotic behavior. We summarize the behavior of J(t) below:
A. Bistability
Dynamical systems frequently exhibit hysteresis before the onset of oscillatory behavior. Accordingly, a bistable response between two distinct fixed points of J(t) has been observed at sufficiently low temperatures [29–31].
B. Supercritical Hopf bifurcation
As the bias voltage is increased, J(t) undergoes a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. The fixed point becomes unstable, and J(t) becomes attracted to a closed periodic orbit. In this regime, the SSL acts as a GHz oscillator with a discrete power spectrum involving the frequencies f_{n} = n/T, n = 1, 2, 3,…, where the fundamental period T is the period of the lowest-frequency oscillation present. The superharmonics n > 1 arise due to the nonlinearities of the SRT model. Since T varies smoothly with the bias voltage, the oscillator is also tunable.
C. Period doubling bifurcation
The periodic orbit described above is topologically equivalent to a circle in phase space. The Poincaré map of this trajectory consists of a single point, called a one-cycle. Upon increasing the bias voltage further, one-cycles of the Poincaré map can transition to two-cycles, i.e., two points, meaning that the orbit circles twice before it closes onto itself. The fundamental period of the oscillator is doubled, T → 2T, and the fundamental frequency is cut in half: f_{1} → f_{1}/2. A new peak appears in the power spectrum at half the fundamental frequency, and the number of superharmonics doubles. Following a period doubling bifurcation, it is possible that the reverse (period-halving) bifurcation may occur. We refer to the regions between these bifurcations as period doubling bubbles. An application of period doubling, due to the subharmonic peak, is the generation of squeezed states [27], which have applications in the area of noise reduction.
D. Period doubling cascade
An infinite number of period doublings are possible within a finite voltage interval. The invariant phase space structures transition from a smooth compact manifolds (periodic orbits of high periods) to irregular sets called strange attractors. The Poincaré map takes on a fractal structure.
In the first column of Fig. 1, we observe longer-period oscillations punctuated by much shorter-period spiking behavior in the time trace of J, which corresponds to the average current through the SSL. The longest time scales present in these oscillations are set by the amount of time necessary for a dipole wave to propagate from the anode to the cathode of the SSL, similar to Gunn oscillations. The shorter-timescale dynamics are associated with electronic tunneling processes, which transfer charge between adjacent wells. The shortest timescale of this problem is the time necessary for an excited state of a single well to become depopulated. However, this timescale has been averaged out of the SRT model in passing to the semiclassical limit [21,23].
Transport in SSLs can take place through two possible channels: Quantum tunneling between the Γ valleys of adjacent wells, or phonon-assisted transport through the X valley of the barriers (Γ-X transfer). Chaotic oscillations in SSLs are only possible when tunneling transport dominates over diffusive transport [18,19]. The phonon-assisted transport may be suppressed by (a) lowering the temperature of the SSL, (b) reducing the level of doping (and hence the Fermi energy), or (c) diluting the aluminum in the barriers. For GaAs/AlAs SSLs, the X-valley of the AlAs barriers is only 110 meV higher than the lowest subband of the 4 nm GaAs wells considered in this paper. Decreasing the concentration of aluminum in the barriers has the effect of lowering the Γ-minimum and increasing the X-minimum.
For Al_{x}Ga_{1–}_{x}As SSLs with aluminum concentration x = 0.45, the Γ- and X-minima are both 337 meV above the lowest subband of the GaAs well. Therefore, at room temperature, the x = 0.45 SSLs suppress the phonon-assisted transport by a factor of about 1.6 × 10^{−4} compared with the x = 0 SSLs [18]. For comparison, the X minimum of the x = 0.7 barrier is estimated about 214 meV above the lowest subband of the GaAs well; hence, the room-temperature suppression factor for x = 0.7 SSLs is estimated to be roughly 1.8 × 10^{−2}, necessitating lower temperature operation. In this work, we fix the doping density to N_{D} = 6 × 10^{10} cm^{−2} and consider two scenarios: GaAs/Al_{0.7}Ga_{0.3}As SSLs at 77 K and GaAs/Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}As SSLs at 295 K.
With an eye towards development of fast, electronic true random number generators, we investigate the response of the chaotic signal to variations of the design parameters of these systems: The number of periods, the contact conductivity, and the strength of the disorder (aperiodicity) of the SSL. The outline of our paper is as follows: In Sec. II, we review the SRT model. In Sec. III, we describe the numerical methods. In Sec. IV, we present the results of our simulations. A discussion of our results is given in Sec. V.
II. MODEL
Many phenomena are captured by the SRT model of nonlinear charge transport in SSLs [14,21,22,28]. Consider a weakly coupled superlattice having N identical periods of length l and total length L = Nl subject to a dc bias voltage V_{bias}. The time evolution of the average electric field of SSL period i, F_{i}, and the total current density, J(t), are coupled together by Ampere's law
with the voltage bias constraint
Fluctuations of F_{i} away from its average value F_{avg} = eV_{bias}/L arise from the inter-site tunneling current J_{i}_{→}_{i}_{+1}, which appears in Eq. (1). A microscopic derivation of J_{i}_{→}_{i}_{+1} produces the result [21,23]
in which n_{i} is the electron sheet density at site i, –e < 0 is the electron charge, and T is the lattice temperature. The forward velocity, v^{(f)}(F_{i}), which is modeled as a Lorentzian distribution, is peaked at resonant values of F_{i}, where the lowest energy level at site i is aligned with one of the levels at site i + 1. The backward tunneling current is given by
where the reference value of the effective electron mass in Al_{x}Ga_{1–}_{x}As is m* = (0.063 + 0.083x)m_{e}, and k_{B} is the Boltzmann constant. The n_{i} are determined self-consistently from the discrete Poisson equation
where N_{D} is the doping sheet density and ϵ is the average permittivity. The field variables F_{i} are constrained by boundary conditions at i = 0 and i = N that represent Ohmic contacts with the electrical leads
where σ_{0} is the contact conductivity. Shot and thermal noise can be added as indicated in Refs [15] and  [24].
Table I gives the numerical values of the parameters used in the simulations. The GaAs/Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}As configuration corresponds with the configuration used in recent experiments [13,18,25]. The rest of the parameters are as follows: A = s^{2} is the transversal area of the superlattice, d and w are the barrier and well widths, and l = d + w is the SSL period. The contact conductivity σ_{0} is a linear approximation of the behavior of J_{0→1}, which depends on the structure of the emitter. We treat σ_{0} as an empirical parameter and investigate the response of the SRT model as it is varied. Some representative values have been chosen in order to reproduce the experimental results produced by Huang et_al with N = 50: σ_{0} = 0.783 A/V m for V_{barr} = 388 meV (x = 0.45) and σ_{0} = 0.06 A/V m for V_{barr} = 600 meV (x = 0.7), where V_{barr} is the height of the barrier [15,18].
A. Noise
To model the unavoidable fluctuations in the bias voltage, as well as the short-timescale processes in the electronic dynamics, stochastic terms [15] are introduced into Eqs. (1)–(6). To account for the noise in the bias voltage, Eq. (2) is modified to
where η(t) is taken to be a Gaussian random variable with standard deviation σ_{η}. To account for the short-timescale processes at each site of the SSL, Eq. (1) is modified to include shot noise in the local tunneling current
where
We see that η(t) is independent of i, while ξ_{i}(t) are independent Gaussian random variables associated with each site of the SSL. The strength of the fluctuations in the bias voltage may be tuned via the empirical parameter σ_{η}, while the strength of the fluctuations in the local tunneling current is completely determined by the parameters of Table I.
B. Disorder
We also consider time-independent perturbations that break the periodicity of the SSL. We introduce variations in the widths of the wells and barriers via the scaling parameters β_{i} and ζ_{i}, where in general the index i runs over all the periods of the SSL. In Sec. IV, we only consider widening a single well, keeping all other scaling parameters fixed to unity. The perturbed well and barrier lengths are
The change in the total length of the SSL modifies the bias constraint equation (2) to
To the lowest order, the energy levels scale with β_{i} according to
These modifications imply that the effective dielectric constant becomes dependent on i
Following Bonilla et_al [30], Eqs. (3) and (4) are modified to account for the effects of disorder on v^{(f)}(F_{i}) and τ_{i}
The parameters γ_{C}_{,}_{m} describe the width of the Lorentzian broadening functions that govern the degree to which the energy levels must be aligned in order for tunneling to take place. From Ref [30], these are taken to be γ_{C}_{,1} = 2.5 meV, γ_{C}_{,2} = 8.0 meV, and γ_{C}_{,3} = 24 meV. The magnitudes of the propagating (kim) or decaying (αim) wavevectors are given by
and
III. COMPUTING THE POINCARÉ MAP
The Poincaré map is used to gain insight into the structure of trajectories through high-dimensional space. In this section, we outline our method of numerically computing the Poincaré map. The evolution equations (1)–(6) are evolved in time using the forward Euler method and the trajectory [F_{i}(t), n_{i}(t), J(t)] through the (2N + 1)-dimensional phase space is stored. When applicable, the stochastic terms ξ_{i}(t) and η(t) are included using the Euler-Maruyama method. The first step is to construct the phase portrait, i.e., to project the evolution onto a two-dimensional surface in phase space. We choose the surface spanned by the coordinates (F_{i}, F_{j}) for some values of i and j near the anode and cathode of the SSL. Several phase portraits corresponding to a period-doubling cascade are illustrated in the second column of Fig. 1.
The next step is to compute the Poincaré map of the phase portrait. After sufficient time has elapsed, and regardless of the initial conditions, the phase space trajectory settles onto one of the following time-invariant structures: (a) Fixed point, (b) periodic orbit, and (c) strange attractor. The Poincaré map is used to distinguish between these structures. It is computed according to the following procedure: First, the transient behavior associated with the initial conditions is excised from the trajectory and only the remaining data are considered in what follows: When F_{i}(t) passes through its median value, the time t* and the field F_{j}(t*) are stored. We also compute the quantity Ḟ{i}(t^{*}) from Eq. (1). We then discard all of the values of t* for which Ḟ{i}(t^{*})>0, in order to prevent sampling the same orbit more than once per cycle. The remaining points constitute the Poincaré map PF_{i}. The Poincaré map transforms the essentially continuous trajectory through phase space into a discrete map from the one-dimensional interval onto itself [26]. We represent it visually in terms of (a) phase portraits, plotting PF_{j}(t^{*}) against PḞ{j}(t^{*}), as in the third column of Fig. 1, or (b) bifurcation diagrams, plotting PF_{j} against some external parameter such as the bias voltage, as in the bottom row of Fig. 2.
Both fixed points and periodic orbits appear as a single point in the visualization of the Poincaré map. However, fixed points are easily distinguished from periodic orbits (one-cycles) by computing the power spectrum associated with the current J(t)
where f is the frequency. A period-doubling bifurcation is identified when one-cycles transition to two-cycles, producing two points in the Poincaré map. Chaotic regions are identified where a proliferation of period-doubling bifurcations occurs, and the number of points in the Poincaré map increases without bound, yielding a fractal structure in the bifurcation diagram.
Dynamical structures revealed by the Poincaré map are associated with various power spectra as follows: (a) Periodic orbits correspond to a series of peaks with widths of the same order as the frequency bin size, falling at integer multiples of the fundamental frequency, (b) period doubling bifurcations are recognized when the number of peaks in the spectrum changes by a factor of two, and a new peak appears in the power spectrum at half the fundamental frequency, and (c) chaotic attractors exhibit power spectra containing both sharp peaks and broadband noise. We illustrate the bifurcation diagram and power spectrum in Fig. 2.
IV. RESULTS
Dynamical instabilities are found in two distinct plateaus, over which the local electric fields of the SSL cease to increase monotonically as a function of V_{bias}. The first plateau occurs at very low voltages, where tunneling transport between the ground states of adjacent wells is nearly aligned with one another in energy. The second plateau occurs in the region of V_{bias} such that the external electric field tilts the potential of the SSL to align the ground state of well i with the first excited state of well i + 1. We do not observe a third plateau because the third excited state becomes unbound at bias voltages that align it with the ground state of the previous well.
Within a plateau, we may observe period-doubling bifurcations, period-doubling cascades, and chaotic attractors, whose locations depend on the values of the rest of the parameters, in particular σ, the contact conductivity, N, the number of wells making up the SSL, and β(ζ), the strength of the perturbations to the well (barrier) widths. Shorter superlattices exhibit faster oscillations and a greater variety of dynamical behavior in the second plateau [16]. We are concerned with finding the parameter regions with the strongest nonlinear phenomena. Our observable of interest is the periodicity, i.e., the number of distinct points in the Poincaré map, which is equivalent to the number of branches in the bifurcation diagram. The nonlinear orbits of higher periodicity are found deeper into the period doubling cascade, either within or near to the chaotic windows.
An important empirical parameter of the SRT model is the contact conductivity. In Fig. 3, we show the response of the periodicity to variations in the contact conductivity. We have chosen the values of N which maximize the total area of the high-period orbits in the Poincaré mapping as a function of voltage: N = 14 for GaAs/Al_{0.7}Ga_{0.3}As SSLs, and N = 10 for GaAs/Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}As SSLs. In both cases, we observe that the second plateau remains in existence for very low conductivity, then narrows, fragments, and disappears at sufficiently high conductivity. The period-doubling cascade occurs near the higher conductivities and voltages contained within the second plateau. In the rest of our results, we set the conductivity to σ = 0.06 A/Vm for GaAs/Al_{0.7}Ga_{0.3}As SSLs (the same as in Ref [16]) and σ = 0.30 V/Am for GaAs/Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}As SSLs.
We next consider varying N, the number of periods making up the SSL in Fig. 4. In both cases, we observe a band of higher periodicity including chaotic behavior in the vicinity of N = 10. The shorter superlattice appears to have a gap in the chaotic behavior between N = 10 and N = 15, but in fact the voltage windows containing the chaos are too narrow to be observed at this scale. The band of chaotic behavior in the GaAs/Al_{0.7}Ga_{0.3}As SSLs is located along the higher voltages of the second plateau. In both cases, the chaotic windows narrow and finally close for values of N between 15 and 20. Part of the first plateau is also visible in the bottom right corners of Figs. 4(a) and 4(b).
Finally, we investigate the sensitivity of the chaos to disorder by varying the width of well 6 via the scaling parameter β_{6} in Fig. 5. The width of one GaAs monolayer is about 0.28 nm. In our simulations, the addition of a single monolayer is capable of destroying the chaos in the case of the taller barriers. On the other hand, the chaotic signal of the shorter barriers appears to be enhanced by the presence of disorder. We note that the location of the added disorder is nearer to the cathode for the taller barriers and nearer to the anode for the shorter barriers. It would be interesting to further investigate the conditions where the chaos is enhanced by the presence of disorder.
We simulate the effects of noise on the bifurcation diagram in Fig. 6, including both shot noise and bias voltage noise. We can see that in regions where the periodicity (number of branches in the bifurcation diagram) is low, the noise widens the Poincaré map from an isolated point into a cluster, but the branches are still recognizable. On the other hand, where the periodicity is higher or the dynamics are chaotic, the noise widens the Poincaré map into a broad band.
Let us imagine an experiment which detects the local field F_{6}, shown in Fig. 6, at some finite resolution, i.e., the number of bins, with the objective of reading out a sequence of random bits. Then, the random bit generation rate will scale proportionally to the width of the Poincaré map times the resolution of the imaginary F_{6}-sensor. The bands within the regions of higher periodicity or intrinsic dynamical chaos would cover a larger number of bins. Hence, these regions would generate random bits at higher bandwidth in comparison with the regions of lower periodicity. In practice, the local current I_{6} would be easier to measure, but the results would be qualitatively very similar.
V. CONCLUSIONS
The discovery of robust, high-frequency, intrinsic nonlinear phenomena and chaos in shorter semiconductor superlattices in the sequential tunneling regime points the way toward a variety of useful devices. In this work, we have characterized the response of the chaotic oscillations to variations in the number of SSL periods and the contact conductivity, providing a guide for the experimental investigation of the emergence of chaos in short SSLs. The chaos is predicted to appear as the result of a period-doubling cascade.
We have also investigated the response of the chaotic signal to stochastic perturbations in the local tunneling currents and the bias voltage. In contrast with the slower, noise-driven chaos in the first plateau for longer superlattices, we observe that shorter SSLs allow for faster, intrinsic chaos in the second plateau.
We have also investigated the effects of variations in the widths of the wells and barriers on the period-doubling cascade. We find that the period-doubling cascade is very sensitive to these perturbations. An error of only a single monolayer has a strong impact on the width of the windows of chaotic behavior. The chaotic windows may be either widened or suppressed depending on the location of the irregularities; hence, it may be possible to engineer aperiodicities in SSLs in order to increase the chaotic signal.
We had initially conjectured that the presence of aperiodicities could unfold the period-doubling bifurcation into a second Hopf bifurcation. However, this turned out not to be the case. Our study of the DC-biased SRT model shows only a period-doubling route to chaos (no second Hopf bifurcation). On the experimental side, quasi-periodic orbits and the associated invariant tori are commonplace. An interesting theoretical question is: By what mechanism do quasi-periodic orbits appear in weakly coupled SSLs?
The observation of quasiperiodic and chaotic electronic dynamics in GaAs/(Al, Ga)As superlattices at room temperature [19] has renewed theoretical investigation into the basic characteristics of these nonlinear phenomena. Recently, it was discovered that the semiclassical resonant sequential tunneling model exhibits a period-doubling cascade to chaos in shorter (10-period) superlattices [16]. The full period-doubling cascade is not present in longer (50-period) superlattices; hence, the short (10-period) superlattice provides a fast and robust source of entropy applicable to secure random number generation. In this article, a careful analysis of the Poincaré map shows the response of the chaotic dynamics to variations in the basic design parameter space. The results show the structure of the chaotic dynamical phases within the parameter space. This information is necessary to guide the experimental search for intrinsic dynamical chaos in semiconductor superlattices.
Chaotic oscillations in n-doped, weakly coupled semiconductor superlattices (SSLs) have generated interest for many years. Spontaneous oscillations, quasiperiodic orbits, and chaos have already been observed experimentally at very low temperatures [5–7] and at room temperature [8–11,13,18–20] in 50-period SSLs. The sequential resonant tunneling (SRT) model of Bonilla et_al (see reviews in Refs [22] and  [28]) captures the essential physics of tunneling transport in SSLs. The model contains nonlinearities arising from feedback between resonant tunneling through the barriers and the self-consistent electric field of the mobile carriers. Simulations of the 50-period SSLs by Alvaro et_al [15] demonstrated extreme sensitivity to weak stochastic perturbations of the local electric fields and the bias voltage, which provided a qualitative description of the experimental results. However, the unperturbed dynamics of the 50-period SRT model contained only a period doubling bifurcation, rather than fully developed chaos. Recently, it was observed that shorter (10-period) SSLs support chaotic oscillations on much faster timescales [16,17]. In contrast with the 50-period simulations, the chaos in shorter SSLs exhibited a complete period-doubling cascade.
One of the practical applications of chaotic oscillations in SSLs is the secure generation of random bit sequences [1–4]. With faster chaotic oscillations, shorter SSLs would achieve a higher random bit rate. In this work, we provide aid to the experimental search for period-doubling cascades in shorter SSLs by mapping out the response of the SRT model to variations of the basic design parameters.
We simulate the SRT theory, which describes electronic transport in SSLs in the weakly coupled, self-consistent regime. Two different time scales are taken into account in this description: The inter-site tunneling and inter-subband relaxation processes occur on much shorter timescales than the dielectric relaxation processes [23]. Therefore, the long timescale dynamics of semiconductor lasers [12] and superlattices [14,15] are typically modeled using semiclassical equations, while the short timescale processes are treated through the addition of stochastic terms to the dynamical equations. Nonlinearities enter the model via the self-consistent electron-electron Coulomb interaction, which bends the conduction band of the SSL, modifying the inter-subband tunneling rates by casting the energy levels of adjacent wells into or out of resonance [23].
Over some intervals of the bias voltage, the total current J(t) through the SSL is a monotonically increasing function of the bias voltage. At higher bias voltages, J(t) suddenly changes to a time-dependent, oscillatory function, which undergoes a series of transitions, leading to chaotic behavior. We summarize the behavior of J(t) below:
Dynamical systems frequently exhibit hysteresis before the onset of oscillatory behavior. Accordingly, a bistable response between two distinct fixed points of J(t) has been observed at sufficiently low temperatures [29–31].
As the bias voltage is increased, J(t) undergoes a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. The fixed point becomes unstable, and J(t) becomes attracted to a closed periodic orbit. In this regime, the SSL acts as a GHz oscillator with a discrete power spectrum involving the frequencies f_{n} = n/T, n = 1, 2, 3,…, where the fundamental period T is the period of the lowest-frequency oscillation present. The superharmonics n > 1 arise due to the nonlinearities of the SRT model. Since T varies smoothly with the bias voltage, the oscillator is also tunable.
The periodic orbit described above is topologically equivalent to a circle in phase space. The Poincaré map of this trajectory consists of a single point, called a one-cycle. Upon increasing the bias voltage further, one-cycles of the Poincaré map can transition to two-cycles, i.e., two points, meaning that the orbit circles twice before it closes onto itself. The fundamental period of the oscillator is doubled, T → 2T, and the fundamental frequency is cut in half: f_{1} → f_{1}/2. A new peak appears in the power spectrum at half the fundamental frequency, and the number of superharmonics doubles. Following a period doubling bifurcation, it is possible that the reverse (period-halving) bifurcation may occur. We refer to the regions between these bifurcations as period doubling bubbles. An application of period doubling, due to the subharmonic peak, is the generation of squeezed states [27], which have applications in the area of noise reduction.
An infinite number of period doublings are possible within a finite voltage interval. The invariant phase space structures transition from a smooth compact manifolds (periodic orbits of high periods) to irregular sets called strange attractors. The Poincaré map takes on a fractal structure.
In the first column of Fig. 1, we observe longer-period oscillations punctuated by much shorter-period spiking behavior in the time trace of J, which corresponds to the average current through the SSL. The longest time scales present in these oscillations are set by the amount of time necessary for a dipole wave to propagate from the anode to the cathode of the SSL, similar to Gunn oscillations. The shorter-timescale dynamics are associated with electronic tunneling processes, which transfer charge between adjacent wells. The shortest timescale of this problem is the time necessary for an excited state of a single well to become depopulated. However, this timescale has been averaged out of the SRT model in passing to the semiclassical limit [21,23].
Transport in SSLs can take place through two possible channels: Quantum tunneling between the Γ valleys of adjacent wells, or phonon-assisted transport through the X valley of the barriers (Γ-X transfer). Chaotic oscillations in SSLs are only possible when tunneling transport dominates over diffusive transport [18,19]. The phonon-assisted transport may be suppressed by (a) lowering the temperature of the SSL, (b) reducing the level of doping (and hence the Fermi energy), or (c) diluting the aluminum in the barriers. For GaAs/AlAs SSLs, the X-valley of the AlAs barriers is only 110 meV higher than the lowest subband of the 4 nm GaAs wells considered in this paper. Decreasing the concentration of aluminum in the barriers has the effect of lowering the Γ-minimum and increasing the X-minimum.
For Al_{x}Ga_{1–}_{x}As SSLs with aluminum concentration x = 0.45, the Γ- and X-minima are both 337 meV above the lowest subband of the GaAs well. Therefore, at room temperature, the x = 0.45 SSLs suppress the phonon-assisted transport by a factor of about 1.6 × 10^{−4} compared with the x = 0 SSLs [18]. For comparison, the X minimum of the x = 0.7 barrier is estimated about 214 meV above the lowest subband of the GaAs well; hence, the room-temperature suppression factor for x = 0.7 SSLs is estimated to be roughly 1.8 × 10^{−2}, necessitating lower temperature operation. In this work, we fix the doping density to N_{D} = 6 × 10^{10} cm^{−2} and consider two scenarios: GaAs/Al_{0.7}Ga_{0.3}As SSLs at 77 K and GaAs/Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}As SSLs at 295 K.
With an eye towards development of fast, electronic true random number generators, we investigate the response of the chaotic signal to variations of the design parameters of these systems: The number of periods, the contact conductivity, and the strength of the disorder (aperiodicity) of the SSL. The outline of our paper is as follows: In Sec. II, we review the SRT model. In Sec. III, we describe the numerical methods. In Sec. IV, we present the results of our simulations. A discussion of our results is given in Sec. V.
Many phenomena are captured by the SRT model of nonlinear charge transport in SSLs [14,21,22,28]. Consider a weakly coupled superlattice having N identical periods of length l and total length L = Nl subject to a dc bias voltage V_{bias}. The time evolution of the average electric field of SSL period i, F_{i}, and the total current density, J(t), are coupled together by Ampere's law
with the voltage bias constraint
Fluctuations of F_{i} away from its average value F_{avg} = eV_{bias}/L arise from the inter-site tunneling current J_{i}_{→}_{i}_{+1}, which appears in Eq. (1). A microscopic derivation of J_{i}_{→}_{i}_{+1} produces the result [21,23]
in which n_{i} is the electron sheet density at site i, –e < 0 is the electron charge, and T is the lattice temperature. The forward velocity, v^{(f)}(F_{i}), which is modeled as a Lorentzian distribution, is peaked at resonant values of F_{i}, where the lowest energy level at site i is aligned with one of the levels at site i + 1. The backward tunneling current is given by
where the reference value of the effective electron mass in Al_{x}Ga_{1–}_{x}As is m* = (0.063 + 0.083x)m_{e}, and k_{B} is the Boltzmann constant. The n_{i} are determined self-consistently from the discrete Poisson equation
where N_{D} is the doping sheet density and ϵ is the average permittivity. The field variables F_{i} are constrained by boundary conditions at i = 0 and i = N that represent Ohmic contacts with the electrical leads
where σ_{0} is the contact conductivity. Shot and thermal noise can be added as indicated in Refs [15] and  [24].
Table I gives the numerical values of the parameters used in the simulations. The GaAs/Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}As configuration corresponds with the configuration used in recent experiments [13,18,25]. The rest of the parameters are as follows: A = s^{2} is the transversal area of the superlattice, d and w are the barrier and well widths, and l = d + w is the SSL period. The contact conductivity σ_{0} is a linear approximation of the behavior of J_{0→1}, which depends on the structure of the emitter. We treat σ_{0} as an empirical parameter and investigate the response of the SRT model as it is varied. Some representative values have been chosen in order to reproduce the experimental results produced by Huang et_al with N = 50: σ_{0} = 0.783 A/V m for V_{barr} = 388 meV (x = 0.45) and σ_{0} = 0.06 A/V m for V_{barr} = 600 meV (x = 0.7), where V_{barr} is the height of the barrier [15,18].
To model the unavoidable fluctuations in the bias voltage, as well as the short-timescale processes in the electronic dynamics, stochastic terms [15] are introduced into Eqs. (1)–(6). To account for the noise in the bias voltage, Eq. (2) is modified to
where η(t) is taken to be a Gaussian random variable with standard deviation σ_{η}. To account for the short-timescale processes at each site of the SSL, Eq. (1) is modified to include shot noise in the local tunneling current
where
We see that η(t) is independent of i, while ξ_{i}(t) are independent Gaussian random variables associated with each site of the SSL. The strength of the fluctuations in the bias voltage may be tuned via the empirical parameter σ_{η}, while the strength of the fluctuations in the local tunneling current is completely determined by the parameters of Table I.
We also consider time-independent perturbations that break the periodicity of the SSL. We introduce variations in the widths of the wells and barriers via the scaling parameters β_{i} and ζ_{i}, where in general the index i runs over all the periods of the SSL. In Sec. IV, we only consider widening a single well, keeping all other scaling parameters fixed to unity. The perturbed well and barrier lengths are
The change in the total length of the SSL modifies the bias constraint equation (2) to
To the lowest order, the energy levels scale with β_{i} according to
These modifications imply that the effective dielectric constant becomes dependent on i
Following Bonilla et_al [30], Eqs. (3) and (4) are modified to account for the effects of disorder on v^{(f)}(F_{i}) and τ_{i}
The parameters γ_{C}_{,}_{m} describe the width of the Lorentzian broadening functions that govern the degree to which the energy levels must be aligned in order for tunneling to take place. From Ref [30], these are taken to be γ_{C}_{,1} = 2.5 meV, γ_{C}_{,2} = 8.0 meV, and γ_{C}_{,3} = 24 meV. The magnitudes of the propagating (kim) or decaying (αim) wavevectors are given by

The Poincaré map is used to gain insight into the structure of trajectories through high-dimensional space. In this section, we outline our method of numerically computing the Poincaré map. The evolution equations (1)–(6) are evolved in time using the forward Euler method and the trajectory [F_{i}(t), n_{i}(t), J(t)] through the (2N + 1)-dimensional phase space is stored. When applicable, the stochastic terms ξ_{i}(t) and η(t) are included using the Euler-Maruyama method. The first step is to construct the phase portrait, i.e., to project the evolution onto a two-dimensional surface in phase space. We choose the surface spanned by the coordinates (F_{i}, F_{j}) for some values of i and j near the anode and cathode of the SSL. Several phase portraits corresponding to a period-doubling cascade are illustrated in the second column of Fig. 1.
The next step is to compute the Poincaré map of the phase portrait. After sufficient time has elapsed, and regardless of the initial conditions, the phase space trajectory settles onto one of the following time-invariant structures: (a) Fixed point, (b) periodic orbit, and (c) strange attractor. The Poincaré map is used to distinguish between these structures. It is computed according to the following procedure: First, the transient behavior associated with the initial conditions is excised from the trajectory and only the remaining data are considered in what follows: When F_{i}(t) passes through its median value, the time t* and the field F_{j}(t*) are stored. We also compute the quantity Ḟ{i}(t^{*}) from Eq. (1). We then discard all of the values of t* for which Ḟ{i}(t^{*})>0, in order to prevent sampling the same orbit more than once per cycle. The remaining points constitute the Poincaré map PF_{i}. The Poincaré map transforms the essentially continuous trajectory through phase space into a discrete map from the one-dimensional interval onto itself [26]. We represent it visually in terms of (a) phase portraits, plotting PF_{j}(t^{*}) against PḞ{j}(t^{*}), as in the third column of Fig. 1, or (b) bifurcation diagrams, plotting PF_{j} against some external parameter such as the bias voltage, as in the bottom row of Fig. 2.
Both fixed points and periodic orbits appear as a single point in the visualization of the Poincaré map. However, fixed points are easily distinguished from periodic orbits (one-cycles) by computing the power spectrum associated with the current J(t)
where f is the frequency. A period-doubling bifurcation is identified when one-cycles transition to two-cycles, producing two points in the Poincaré map. Chaotic regions are identified where a proliferation of period-doubling bifurcations occurs, and the number of points in the Poincaré map increases without bound, yielding a fractal structure in the bifurcation diagram.
Dynamical structures revealed by the Poincaré map are associated with various power spectra as follows: (a) Periodic orbits correspond to a series of peaks with widths of the same order as the frequency bin size, falling at integer multiples of the fundamental frequency, (b) period doubling bifurcations are recognized when the number of peaks in the spectrum changes by a factor of two, and a new peak appears in the power spectrum at half the fundamental frequency, and (c) chaotic attractors exhibit power spectra containing both sharp peaks and broadband noise. We illustrate the bifurcation diagram and power spectrum in Fig. 2.
Dynamical instabilities are found in two distinct plateaus, over which the local electric fields of the SSL cease to increase monotonically as a function of V_{bias}. The first plateau occurs at very low voltages, where tunneling transport between the ground states of adjacent wells is nearly aligned with one another in energy. The second plateau occurs in the region of V_{bias} such that the external electric field tilts the potential of the SSL to align the ground state of well i with the first excited state of well i + 1. We do not observe a third plateau because the third excited state becomes unbound at bias voltages that align it with the ground state of the previous well.
Within a plateau, we may observe period-doubling bifurcations, period-doubling cascades, and chaotic attractors, whose locations depend on the values of the rest of the parameters, in particular σ, the contact conductivity, N, the number of wells making up the SSL, and β(ζ), the strength of the perturbations to the well (barrier) widths. Shorter superlattices exhibit faster oscillations and a greater variety of dynamical behavior in the second plateau [16]. We are concerned with finding the parameter regions with the strongest nonlinear phenomena. Our observable of interest is the periodicity, i.e., the number of distinct points in the Poincaré map, which is equivalent to the number of branches in the bifurcation diagram. The nonlinear orbits of higher periodicity are found deeper into the period doubling cascade, either within or near to the chaotic windows.
An important empirical parameter of the SRT model is the contact conductivity. In Fig. 3, we show the response of the periodicity to variations in the contact conductivity. We have chosen the values of N which maximize the total area of the high-period orbits in the Poincaré mapping as a function of voltage: N = 14 for GaAs/Al_{0.7}Ga_{0.3}As SSLs, and N = 10 for GaAs/Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}As SSLs. In both cases, we observe that the second plateau remains in existence for very low conductivity, then narrows, fragments, and disappears at sufficiently high conductivity. The period-doubling cascade occurs near the higher conductivities and voltages contained within the second plateau. In the rest of our results, we set the conductivity to σ = 0.06 A/Vm for GaAs/Al_{0.7}Ga_{0.3}As SSLs (the same as in Ref [16]) and σ = 0.30 V/Am for GaAs/Al_{0.45}Ga_{0.55}As SSLs.
We next consider varying N, the number of periods making up the SSL in Fig. 4. In both cases, we observe a band of higher periodicity including chaotic behavior in the vicinity of N = 10. The shorter superlattice appears to have a gap in the chaotic behavior between N = 10 and N = 15, but in fact the voltage windows containing the chaos are too narrow to be observed at this scale. The band of chaotic behavior in the GaAs/Al_{0.7}Ga_{0.3}As SSLs is located along the higher voltages of the second plateau. In both cases, the chaotic windows narrow and finally close for values of N between 15 and 20. Part of the first plateau is also visible in the bottom right corners of Figs. 4(a) and 4(b).
Finally, we investigate the sensitivity of the chaos to disorder by varying the width of well 6 via the scaling parameter β_{6} in Fig. 5. The width of one GaAs monolayer is about 0.28 nm. In our simulations, the addition of a single monolayer is capable of destroying the chaos in the case of the taller barriers. On the other hand, the chaotic signal of the shorter barriers appears to be enhanced by the presence of disorder. We note that the location of the added disorder is nearer to the cathode for the taller barriers and nearer to the anode for the shorter barriers. It would be interesting to further investigate the conditions where the chaos is enhanced by the presence of disorder.
We simulate the effects of noise on the bifurcation diagram in Fig. 6, including both shot noise and bias voltage noise. We can see that in regions where the periodicity (number of branches in the bifurcation diagram) is low, the noise widens the Poincaré map from an isolated point into a cluster, but the branches are still recognizable. On the other hand, where the periodicity is higher or the dynamics are chaotic, the noise widens the Poincaré map into a broad band.
Let us imagine an experiment which detects the local field F_{6}, shown in Fig. 6, at some finite resolution, i.e., the number of bins, with the objective of reading out a sequence of random bits. Then, the random bit generation rate will scale proportionally to the width of the Poincaré map times the resolution of the imaginary F_{6}-sensor. The bands within the regions of higher periodicity or intrinsic dynamical chaos would cover a larger number of bins. Hence, these regions would generate random bits at higher bandwidth in comparison with the regions of lower periodicity. In practice, the local current I_{6} would be easier to measure, but the results would be qualitatively very similar.
The discovery of robust, high-frequency, intrinsic nonlinear phenomena and chaos in shorter semiconductor superlattices in the sequential tunneling regime points the way toward a variety of useful devices. In this work, we have characterized the response of the chaotic oscillations to variations in the number of SSL periods and the contact conductivity, providing a guide for the experimental investigation of the emergence of chaos in short SSLs. The chaos is predicted to appear as the result of a period-doubling cascade.
We have also investigated the response of the chaotic signal to stochastic perturbations in the local tunneling currents and the bias voltage. In contrast with the slower, noise-driven chaos in the first plateau for longer superlattices, we observe that shorter SSLs allow for faster, intrinsic chaos in the second plateau.
We have also investigated the effects of variations in the widths of the wells and barriers on the period-doubling cascade. We find that the period-doubling cascade is very sensitive to these perturbations. An error of only a single monolayer has a strong impact on the width of the windows of chaotic behavior. The chaotic windows may be either widened or suppressed depending on the location of the irregularities; hence, it may be possible to engineer aperiodicities in SSLs in order to increase the chaotic signal.
We had initially conjectured that the presence of aperiodicities could unfold the period-doubling bifurcation into a second Hopf bifurcation. However, this turned out not to be the case. Our study of the DC-biased SRT model shows only a period-doubling route to chaos (no second Hopf bifurcation). On the experimental side, quasi-periodic orbits and the associated invariant tori are commonplace. An interesting theoretical question is: By what mechanism do quasi-periodic orbits appear in weakly coupled SSLs?
