Effect of gas filling pressure and operation energy on ion and neutron emission in a medium energy plasma focus device
The effects of gas filling pressure and operation energy on deuterium ions and neutrons have been studied in a medium energy plasma focus device, MEPF-12. The deuterium gas filling pressure was varied from 1 to 10 mbar at an operation energy of 9.7 kJ. Also, the operation energy was varied from 3.9 to 9.7 kJ at a deuterium gas filling pressure of 4 mbar. Time resolved emission of deuterium ions was measured using a Faraday cup. Simultaneously, time integrated and time resolved emissions of neutrons were measured using a silver activation detector and plastic scintillator detector, respectively. Various characteristics (fluence, peak density, and most probable energy) of deuterium ions were estimated using the Faraday cup signal. The fluence was found to be nearly independent of the gas filling pressure and operation energy, but the peak density and most probable energy of deuterium ions were found to be varying. The neutron yield was observed to be varying with the gas filling pressure and operation energy. The effect of ions on neutrons emission was observed at each operation condition.
I. INTRODUCTION
A plasma focus (PF) device is a pulse source of intense radiations, viz., ions, electrons, X-rays, and neutrons (when operated with a deuterium or deuterium-tritium mixture gas) [1]. Ions of different species having energies ranging from a few keV up to MeV have been measured when operated with different filling gases [Hydrogen (H_{2}), Deuterium (D_{2}), Deuterium-Tritium (D-T), Nitrogen (N_{2}), Neon (Ne), Argon (Ar), Methane (CH_{4}), etc.]. The mechanism of ion production and their acceleration to high energies in the PF device has been studied extensively, both experimentally [2–11] as well as theoretically [12–14], by various research groups across the world. The study of ion emission is important in order to understand its effect on neutron emission and also for many applications like ion implantations, surface modifications, and ion assisted thin film depositions [15–17].
Several diagnostic techniques, such as Thomson spectrometry [7], Faraday cup, and solid state nuclear track detectors (SSNTDs) [9,10], as well as nuclear activation [11], have commonly been used to determine the ion emission characteristics. Stygar et_al [9] used SSNTDs to measure ion fluence in a 12.5 kJ PF device. Energetic deuterium ions produced alpha particles (d, α) on striking lithium-borate (Li_{2}B_{4}O_{7}) and were subsequently recorded by CR39 detectors. They estimated the ion fluence of (6 ± 2) × 10^{14} cm^{−2} over a 15 cm diameter plate kept 20 cm away from the plasma focus. Gullickson and Sahlin [11] used nuclear activation [^{12}C (d, n) ^{13}N] to estimate the number of deuterium ions produced in a PF device operated at 76 kJ. The emitted deuterium ions were observed to be highly anisotropic and the ratio of deuterium ions in the 0° to that of 90° (with respect to the electrode axis) was more than 10^{4} in some strong focus shots. On the contrary, Sadowski et_al [8] observed a distinct drop of ion fluence at 0°. Nevertheless, Kelly and Marquez [7] measured the angular distribution of fast deuterium ions in a 5 kJ PF device and observed that the number of ions detected in the 90° direction was approximately 50% of the corresponding number in the 0° direction. Hence, it can be inferred from the various reports that the characteristics of ions cannot be generalized for all the PF devices. This has motivated researchers for further investigation of ions. Most of the experimental investigations are performed to understand its mechanism of emission, as well as to see effects of geometrical and operation parameters on its emission characteristics.
Various computation models such as the moving thermal plasma model [1], the generalized beam target model with a cross-field acceleration [13], and the converging ion model [14] have also been proposed to explain the characteristics of ions. However, the individual model is best suited for a PF device of particular geometries, and none of them could satisfactorily explain the characteristics of ions from a range of PF devices with different geometries and operating energies. Gribkov et_al [18] proposed a mechanism in which ions are produced by diode action in a thin layer close to the anode tip, with plasma disruptions generating the necessary high voltage which in turn accelerates the ions to high energies up to a few MeV. Lee et_al [19–21] used the mechanism proposed by Gribkov et_al to numerically compute the ion emission characteristics for a range of PF devices and found that the ion fluence was independent of operation energy from 0.4 to 486 kJ.
In the present work, the effects of deuterium gas filling pressure and operation energy on the deuterium ion emission characteristics (fluence, peak number density, and most probable energy) have been studied in a medium energy plasma focus device, “MEPF-12.” Simultaneously, neutron yield has also been measured. A correlation between ion and neutron emissions has been tried to be established over a range of deuterium gas filling pressure and operation energy. The operation energy was varied from 3.9 to 9.7 kJ at a deuterium gas filling pressure of 4 mbar and the deuterium gas filling pressure was varied from 1 to 10 mbar at an operation energy of 9.7 kJ. The experimental arrangement is described in Sec. II followed by the experimental results and discussions.
II. EXPERIMENTAL ARRANGEMENT
The present series of investigations on ion emission have been carried out on an in-house developed medium energy plasma focus device, “MEPF-12.” It has an anode of dimension: 60 mm diameter and 77 mm effective length (exposed to plasma). The cathode consists of twelve rods (each, 12 mm diameter and 112 mm effective length) mounted at a 122 mm pitch circle diameter (PCD) in the form of a squirrel cage with the anode at the center. The anode is made hollow of size: 30 mm diameter and 45 mm deep at its top to avoid erosion due to the collision of relativistic electrons during plasma pinch disruptions [22]. Both electrodes are made of a SS304 material. A quartz insulator tube of 54 mm diameter and 2 mm thickness is used to separate them at the bottom. This is essentially required for efficient plasma sheath formation in the initial breakdown phase of plasma focus dynamics [1]. The PF electrode assembly is mounted at the bottom-center of a four-port experimental chamber which makes them a complete PF unit. One of the side ports of the experimental chamber is used for the evacuation and filling of working gas for plasma focus operations.
The PF unit is connected to a capacitor bank (40 μF, 25 kV) in a compact geometry using parallel-plate transmission lines. The capacitor bank consists of four energy storage capacitors (each, 10 μF, 25 kV). An open air triggered spark gap switch is used to transfer energy from the capacitor bank to plasma focus. One end of the triggered spark gap is screwed to the collector plate and the discharge end is interfaced to the PF anode. The schematic of the experimental set-up is shown in Fig. 1.
A pickup loop was used to record the current-derivative (dI/dt) signal and the current was obtained by passively integrating the dI/dt signal externally. A plastic scintillator detector (PSD) coupled to a photomultiplier tube was employed for time resolved neutron emission measurement. PSD was placed in the radial direction (90° to the electrode axis) at 2 m distance from the PF anode tip in order to separate neutrons and hard X-rays pulses. An in situ calibrated, Gieger-Muller (GM) counter based the silver activation detector (SAD) was deployed at 1.5 m in the radial direction for time-integrated neutron yield measurement. The time resolved emission of ions was measured using an in-house designed Faraday cup. The Faraday cup was of conical geometry where electrodes made of graphite and brass were used as the ion collector and ground, respectively, and separated using Teflon. The collector was biased negatively at −100 V to record ions. An aperture of 1 mm dia. was kept at the opening of the Faraday cup to control the ions reaching the collector. The Faraday cup was placed at 14 cm from the anode tip along the axial direction. A shutter was in place before the Faraday cup during the insulator conditioning shots and it was removed after obtaining the strong pinch. Signals from the pickup loop, PSD, and Faraday cup were monitored in a digital phosphor oscilloscope having 1 GHz bandwidth and 5 GS/s sampling rate, through RG58 cables terminated using 50 Ω. All the measurements were performed inside a Faraday cage to reduce electromagnetic interference to the signals.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The maximum peak current deliverable to the PF load was estimated using short circuit measurement. The short circuit inductance of the set-up (with both electrodes shorted at the top) was estimated to be 74 nH and the maximum peak current was estimated to be 457 kA at a charging voltage of 22 kV. For plasma focus operation, the experimental chamber was evacuated to a vacuum of ∼10^{−5} mbar and then filled with the required pressure of deuterium gas. The deuterium gas filling pressure is measured using the Edwards CG 16K capsule dial gauge (0–25 mbar range). A few shots were taken initially at a low filling pressure of 1 mbar. These shots are initially required for insulator surface conditioning which assists in the formation of a uniform plasma sheath and subsequently formation of strong plasma focus. A smooth current derivative waveform or with a mild dip was normally observed during insulator conditioning shots and after that, a large dip was observed. This dip is the signature of plasma pinching. The radiation emission characteristics are strongly correlated to form the dip in the current derivative waveform in a PF device. Typical signals recorded using the Faraday cup, pick up loop, and PSD detector from the MEPF-12 device are displayed in Figs. 2(a) to 2(c). It is observed that the Faraday cup signal consists of a small hump followed by distinct high amplitude peaks. The small hump is observed to be nearly coincident to the dip in the current derivative waveform. It is termed as the photo-peak as it is possibly generated by the photoelectric effect caused by soft X-rays produced in the pinch phase. The time of the photo-peak is taken as the time at which the ions are accelerated [23]. Two pulses observed in PSD are of hard X-rays and neutrons. They are separated due to the difference in their time of flight. The hard X-rays are from Bremsstrahlung radiation produced due to the interaction of energetic electrons with the PF anode after the onset of instability (m = 0, Sausage instability) and pinch column disruption [9].
The characteristics of ions such as density, energy, and fluence can be deduced from the ion pulse recorded using the Faraday cup [6]. The formula for the estimation of number density of ions (n) having velocity v and charge q is
where V is the amplitude of the ion pulse, R (=50 Ω) is the resistance across which the ion pulse is measured, and A is the aperture area of the Faraday cup.
The energy of the ion having velocity v and mass m is estimated using the simple formula
The fluence of ions is estimated using the formula
The peak number density and most probable energy of ions are estimated using the peak amplitude of ion pulse and its corresponding time of flight. For the deuterium ion: q = 1.6 × 10^{−19}c; m = 3.34 × 10^{−27 }kg.
For deuterium ion emission characterizations, the PF device experimental chamber was filled with deuterium gas at a range of pressure varying from 1 to 10 mbar and it was operated at 9.7 kJ. All the three quantities (deuterium ion fluence, peak deuterium ion density, and most probable deuterium ion energy) have been calculated at each deuterium gas filling pressure. Simultaneously, the neutron yield was also measured. Variation in deuterium ion fluence and neutron yield with the filling pressure is shown in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b), respectively. At each filling pressure, six shots at identical operation conditions are considered to obtain average values. The deuterium ion fluence is observed to be varying with the filling pressure with a maximum of (7.0 ± 1.1) × 10^{14} cm^{−2} at 4 mbar and a minimum of (5.7 ± 0.8) × 10^{14} cm^{−2} at 8 mbar. Variation in deuterium ion fluence over the gas filling pressure range of 1 to 10 mbar with respect to the maximum value is 19%. This variation is possibly due to shot to shot variation at apparently identical operating conditions (gas filling pressure and operation energy), as well as error in the detection process, as reported by other researchers earlier [24–26]. These observations suggest that the deuterium ion fluence in the axial direction is nearly independent of the gas filling pressure at an operation energy for a medium energy PF device.
The neutron yield is also observed to be varying with the gas filling pressure. It increases to the maximum at 4 mbar and then decreases with further increase in the gas filling pressure. The neutron yield is maximum of (1.0 ± 0.3) × 10^{9} neutrons/pulse in to 4π sr at 4 mbar, while it decreases to a minimum of (3.0 ± 1.0) × 10^{8} neutrons/pulse in to 4π sr at 10 mbar. The reason for the variation in the neutron yield is attributed to the beam target fusion mechanism of neutron emission in the PF device [7,12,13]. The beam-target neutron yield can be approximated as
Here, n_{D}(v)dv is the velocity distribution of deuterium ions, v is the deuterium ion relative velocity (neutral deuterium molecules are assumed to be at rest), σ is the fusion cross section, and n_{0} is the number density of background deuterium gas in the experimental chamber. Therefore, variation in the neutron yield suggests that the deuterium ion velocity distribution, n_{D}(v)dv, is different at different filling pressures for the same operation energy. Moreover, the peak density and most probable energy of deuterium ions are observed to be varying with the gas filling pressure as depicted in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b), respectively. They increase to the maximum at 4 mbar and then decrease with further increase in the gas filling pressure. The maximum peak density and maximum most probable energy of deuterium ions are found to be (6.7 ± 0.7) × 10^{12} cm^{−3} and (228 ± 34) keV, respectively. It can be inferred from the above observations that higher values of peak density and most probable energy of deuterium ions resulted in higher neutron yield at each gas filling pressure.
In a similar set of experiments, at a gas filling pressure of 4 mbar, the operation energy was varied from 3.9 to 9.7 kJ through the change in the charging voltage of the capacitor bank (40 μF) from 14 to 22 kV. Variations in the deuterium ion fluence and neutron yield with the operation energies have been shown in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b), respectively. The deuterium ion fluence is found to be varying from (7.3 ± 1.1) × 10^{14} cm^{−2} to (7.0 ± 0.7) × 10^{14} cm^{−2} the when operation energy has varied from 3.9 to 9.7 kJ. Variation in the deuterium ion fluence over the given operation energy range is estimated to be 13% with respect to the maximum value. This may be attributed to shot to shot variation, as well as error in the detection process [24–26] as mentioned earlier. Moreover, this suggests that the ion fluence in the axial direction is nearly independent of the operation energy at a gas filling pressure.
The neutron yield is observed to be increasing with the increase in operation energy at a gas filling pressure of 4 mbar. The minimum of (9.1 ± 5.6) × 10^{7} neutrons/shot and maximum of (1.0 ± 0.3) × 10^{9} neutrons/shot into 4π sr is measured at 3.9 kJ and 9.7 kJ, respectively. The peak density and most probable energy of deuterium ions vary with the operation energy as shown in Figs. 6(a) and 6(b), respectively. The peak density is estimated to be the minimum of (2.3 ± 0.5) × 10^{12} cm^{−3} and the maximum of (6.7 ± 0.7) × 10^{12} cm^{−3} at 3.9 kJ and 9.7 kJ, respectively. The corresponding minimum and maximum values of the most probable deuterium ion energy are found to be (84 ± 17) keV and (228 ± 34) keV. Variation in the neutron yield is due to variation in the deuterium ion velocity distribution at different operation energies as mentioned earlier.
The deuterium ion fluence closely matches with the values measured using other diagnostics techniques as well as values obtained numerically [9,21]. Stygar et_al [9] estimated the deuterium ion fluence in a 12.5 kJ PF using the SSNTD technique and the value they obtained was (6 ± 2) × 10^{14} cm^{−2} at a 20 cm distance from the PF anode tip. Lee and Saw [21] numerically computed the ion fluence for various PF devices working at optimum operating conditions. They found that the computed ion fluence was in the range of (2.4–7.8) × 10^{16} cm^{−2} for PF devices operating from 0.4 to 486 kJ. The reason for constancy of ion fluence was attributed to the fact that PF scaling parameters i.e., energy density (energy per unit mass of pinch plasma) is constant in the operation energy range of sub kJ to MJ [20,21]. They have derived an expression for ion fluence using the first principle calculation and expressed as
Here, I_{pinch} is the current flowing through the pinch, r_{p} and Z_{p} are the final pinch radius and length, b is the cathode radius, and U is the disruption caused voltage which is equal to 3 × V_{max}, where V_{max} is the maximum voltage induced by the radially collapsing current sheath.
We ran the Lee Model code [27] for the MEPF-12 device and computed the ion fluence and average ion energy by inserting the output of the code in the above equation. Typical parameters of the MEPF-12 device used for computation are: L_{0} = 74 nH, C_{0} = 40 μF, b = 5.5 cm, a = 3 cm, Z_{0} = 11.5 cm, and r_{0} = 2 mΩ operated at 22 kV and P = 3 Torr (4 mbar) deuterium. The fitted mass and current factors are f_{m} = 0.075; f_{c} = 0.7; f_{mr} = 0.15, and f_{cr} = 0.7. The typical experimental and simulated current waveforms are shown in Fig. 7. The relevant outputs computed from the code are I_{pinch} = 261 kA; r_{p} = 0.43 cm; Z_{p} = 4.4 cm; U = 3 × 38.4; and kV = 115.2 kV. The ion fluence is estimated to be 3.3 × 10^{16} cm^{−2} with a mean energy of 115 keV. These estimated values are found to be in the same range i.e., (2.4–7.8) × 10^{16} cm^{−2} as computed by Lee and Saw [19] for PF devices operating from the 0.4 to 486 kJ range. These values of ion fluence and mean energy are of the pinch and they are estimated to decrease further when the ions propagate along the axially forward direction due to multiple collisions with thermal plasma and the neutral gas atoms in the experimental chamber.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
Ion emission from the MEPF-12 device has been studied using a Faraday cup. The PF device was operated at a deuterium gas filling pressure from 1 to 10 mbar at an operation energy of 9.7 kJ. Also, the operation energy was varied from 3.9 to 9.7 kJ at a deuterium gas filling pressure of 4 mbar. The deuterium ions and neutrons were measured simultaneously and it has been observed that the variation in deuterium ion fluence is not significant over the given range of gas filling pressure and operational energy. Such behavior (deuterium ion fluence remaining unchanged) may be attributed to the fact that PF scaling parameters, i.e., energy density (energy per unit mass of pinch plasma), is constant for an operation energy range of sub kJ to MJ. Variation in the neutron yield suggests that there is a variation in deuterium ion velocity distribution at different deuterium gas filling pressures and operation energies.
