Modulation of terahertz emission in time-domain waveform via a photoinduced phase transition in a charge ordered organic ferroelectric
The time-domain waveform of the terahertz (THz) electric field emitted from the charge-ordered organic ferroelectrics α − (ET)_{2}I_{3} [ET:bis(ethylenedithio)-tetrathiafulvalene)] can be significantly modulated depending on incident fluence of femtosecond pulses. Weak irradiation triggers the emission, showing ∼1 THz oscillation in the time-domain waveform with more than 5 oscillation cycles and a corresponding narrow spectral shape. In contrast, strong irradiation almost completely suppresses the trailing portion of the waveform after the first cycle, resulting in over 3 times broader bandwidth. As revealed by time-resolved experiments, this modulation arises from the cooperative nature of photoinduced melting of the charge order accompanying quenching of infrared-activity of the intermolecular vibrations which strongly couple with the emission.
Terahertz (THz) electromagnetic waves are mandatory for an increasingly wide range of applications, such as probing and controlling material properties [1–4]. Toward manipulation of their spectral content or equivalently time-domain waveform, pulse shaping techniques have been applied to fundamental light for THz generation using a spatial phase modulator [5,6] and to the generated THz wave utilizing photocarriers [7,8]. Fabrication of frequency-tunable emitters has also been achieved by, for example, quasi-phase matching [9], MEMS with a quantum cascade laser [10], resonant tunneling diodes [11], and Josephson junctions [12].
Among solid-state THz emitters, strongly correlated electron systems offer unique scalability of ultrafast modulation via photoinduced phase transitions [13,14]. They can host “melting” of electronic phases on a subpicosecond timescale upon photoexcitation, leading to gigantic dielectric responses such as insulator-to-metal transition. This instantaneous response is comparable with or even faster than a THz period, hence providing tunability in a time-domain waveform, which is distinctive from spectral filters in that it may yield new frequency components; for example, temporary suppression in the time domain can broaden the corresponding spectrum.
In this regard, the layered organic salt α − (ET)_{2}I_{3} [ET:bis(ethylenedithio)-tetrathiafulvalene] is promising, wherein charge order (CO) is formed by strong Coulomb repulsion. Below CO transition temperature T_{CO} = 135 K, charge disproportionation among ET molecules sets in without large structural deformation, accompanying metal-to-insulator transition [15–17]. Therein, ferroelectric polarization of electronic origin [18] shows up to activate the THz emission upon femtosecond laser irradiation [19], as well as optical second harmonic generation (SHG) [20,21]. The THz emission is remarkably efficient; second-order nonlinear susceptibility χ^{(2)} for optical rectification is 70 times larger than that of the prototypical emitter ZnTe [19]. Moreover, photoexcitation can trigger initial melting dynamics of the CO in ∼20 fs and concomitant insulator-to-metal transition [20,22–24], thereby quenching the THz emission intensity [19], suggesting additional controllability over the time-domain waveform.
In this Letter, we demonstrate ultrafast modulation of the THz time-domain waveform emitted from α − (ET)_{2}I_{3} via the photoinduced CO melting. Strong irradiation significantly modulated the waveform, leading to notable broadening in the bandwidth. The observation is attributable to the cooperative nature of the CO melting accompanying quenching of infrared-activity of intermolecular vibrations which strongly couple with the THz emission.
A 1-kHz Ti:sapphire regenerative amplifier system (Coherent Legend USX) was used as a light source. The output at 1.55 eV with a pulse width of 25 fs was used as the fundamental light for the THz emission and used to drive an optical parametric amplifier to generate 0.89 eV pulses with a duration of 100 fs for both fundamental and pump light. The THz emission in transmission geometry [Fig. 1(a)] was detected via electro-optic sampling using 1.55 eV pulses and 3 mm-thick ZnTe. Polarizations of optical and THz beams were parallel to the b-axis of the samples.
α − (ET)_{2}I_{3} was synthesized by the electrochemical method [25]. Bulk single crystals with a typical size of 2 × 2× 0.05 mm^{3} (ab-plane) were mounted on copper plates in a cryostat. Penetration depth d of the incident fundamental or pump light with energy above the CO gap [∼0.1 eV (Refs [16],  [17], and  [26])] is shorter than 2 μm. The coherence length of the THz emission [27] is estimated to be >80 μm in the present experiment; λ/2|n_{g}−n|≫d, where λ and n are the wavelength and refractive index in the THz range, respectively, and n_{g} is the group index of the incident light, hence satisfying the phase matching condition [28].
The lower panel of Fig. 1(b) shows a time-domain waveform of THz electric field E_{THz}(t) emitted from α − (ET)_{2}I_{3} at 124 K < T_{CO}, using 0.89 eV fundamental light at I_{fund} = 0.016 mJ/cm^{2}. The waveform clearly shows ∼1 THz oscillation with more than 5 oscillation cycles, in contrast to that of ZnTe (upper panel) showing nearly single-cycle oscillation. The lower panel of Fig. 1(c) shows amplitude spectra E_{THz}(ω): the Fourier transform of E_{THz}(t). The spectrum for α − (ET)_{2}I_{3} (thick line) showed a narrow peak at around 35 cm^{−1}, reflecting the slow decay in the time domain, with bandwidth less than one-fifth of that for ZnTe (dashed-dotted line) in full width at half maximum (FWHM).
To gain insight into the characteristic narrow peak for α − (ET)_{2}I_{3}, we show steady-state optical conductivity in the upper panel of Fig. 1(c). The spectrum showed peak structures at 31 and 39 cm^{−1} in agreement with previous studies [16,24], indicating phonons at these frequencies (vide infra). Considering that (nonlinear) optical processes in general resonate with electric dipole transitions near their levels [29], it is natural to expect that the phonons contribute to the THz emission along with the purely electronic χ^{(2)} process. In fact, it has been confirmed in various semiconductors and insulators that infrared-active phonon can resonantly enhance SHG via χ^{(2)} [30,31] and can become an origin of THz emission [32–36]. Meanwhile, the emitted THz wave suffers absorption loss due to the phonons during propagation through the sample since the penetration depth of the fundamental light (d = 0.5 μm) is much shorter than the sample thickness (50 μm). However, this spectral deformation cannot account for the characteristic spectral shape. In Fig. 1(c), we also show the spectrum (dotted line) after the correction of the absorption loss along with reflection loss at the end surface using optical constants therein; the spectrum still shows the narrow peak near the phonons. This strong coupling between the THz emission and the phonons should be a key factor for the large χ^{(2)} estimated for this compound [19,37].
While early work assigned those modes to libration and bending of I3− anions [38–40], subsequent studies suggested external vibrations of ET as their origin via Raman [41,42], far-infrared [43], and THz-pump optical-probe [44] spectroscopies. In addition, they contribute to stabilization of the photoinduced metallic states accompanied by the CO melting [22]. Although in-depth assignment based on theoretical calculations [45] is still necessary, these results also support the aforementioned close coupling to the THz emission triggered by photoexcitation of the CO on ETs.
Figure 2(a) shows normalized time-domain waveforms at 124 K at I_{fund} = 0.016 mJ/cm^{2} (broken line) and 0.30 mJ/cm^{2} (thick line). By increasing I_{fund}, the shape of the waveform was significantly modified: in contrast to the unchanged first cycle, the trailing component around ∼2 ps after the photoirradiation was almost completely suppressed. This can be characterized by the peak E_{THz} values of the first and second cycles (denoted as “P1” and “P2,” respectively), as shown in the inset. While P1 grew linearly with I_{fund} as expected for the χ^{(2)} process without the heat accumulation effect, P2 showed a decrease rather than mere saturation behavior in the strong irradiation regime, I_{fund} > 0.1 mJ/cm^{2}.
Figure 2(b) shows E_{THz}(ω) spectra of the waveforms shown in Fig. 2(a). With increasing I_{fund} from 0.016 mJ/cm^{2} (broken line) to 0.30 mJ/cm^{2} (thick line), spectral wings appeared at both the sides of the peak, i.e., the spectrum was broadened, as a result of the strong suppression in the time domain with a finite delay. In accord with the broadening, the FWHM [see triangles in Fig. 2(b)] became more than 3 times larger as shown in Fig. 2(c) [46]. Dips around 31 and 39 cm^{−1} are due to the phonon absorption during the propagation [Fig. 1(c)]. They are responsible for the recovery of the time-domain waveform after 3 ps [a vertical line in Fig. 2(a)] [47].
The observed suppression in the time domain, i.e., spectral broadening, is attributable to the photoinduced CO melting in α − (ET)_{2}I_{3}, which becomes emergent at such strong irradiation [19,20,22–24]. In fact, the observed behavior is quite different from the spectral shift [48,49] or reduction in the high frequency component [27] because of two-photon absorption which often takes place in prototypical THz emitters at strong irradiation.
To confirm the scenario, we performed the optical-pump THz-probe experiment at 124 K [Fig. 3(a)], with the 0.89 eV pump light at 0.23 mJ/cm^{2} in the strong irradiation regime. The THz probe beam was generated using 1.55 eV pulses and a 0.4 mm-thick GaP crystal via optical rectification and was modulated with an optical chopper whereby the contribution of the THz emission by the pump was filtered out. Figure 3(b) shows a steady-state spectrum of absorption coefficient α obtained by time-domain spectroscopy (top panel) and its transient change upon photoexcitation (Δα) at several pump-probe delay times (lower panels).
A broad increase in absorption observed right after the pump (denoted as 0 ps) reflects the photoinduced CO melting and the concomitant metal transition [24]. The increase corresponds to at most ∼10% loss in the electric field amplitude which is too small to explain the significant suppression in the time-domain waveform [Fig. 2(a)]. The spectral shape of Δα changed after 2 ps, which should be related to the development of macroscopic CO-melted domains [22]. An important observation here is the dips (decrease in absorption) at 31 and 39 cm^{−1}, indicating that these intermolecular vibrations lost infrared activity. The normalized absorption decrease |Δα/α| was as large as >0.05 at those frequencies; this is comparable to complete quenching of the oscillator strengths, considering 1% volume fraction of the 0.5 μm-thick photoexcited surface as estimated from the penetration depth, in the 50 μm-thick sample. Although this absorption decrease at the vibration increases E_{THz} which suffers smaller absorption loss, this effect is too small to account for the observed broadening shown in Fig. 2(b). Because |Δα|<|−32cm^{−1}=−0.0032μm^{−1}|, E_{THz} increases by at most 8% as deduced by exp{−(−0.0032)×50}=1.08. Considering the 2% increase estimated at 35 cm^{−1} between the vibrations, the E_{THz} spectrum is expected to show at most 6% relative increase at the vibrations with respect to the 35 cm^{−1} component since 1.08/1.02=1.06. Nevertheless, the observed broadening [Fig. 2(b)] is characterized by more than 100% increase around the peaks (below 30 cm^{−1} and above 40 cm^{−1}) with respect to the 35 cm^{−1} component.
The result can account for the observed delayed suppression in the time-domain waveform [Fig. 2(a)] as follows: Photoexcitation triggers electronic polarization at THz frequency via the χ^{(2)} process without delay, and the THz emission occurs [19]. Accordingly, the infrared-active modes at 31 or 39 cm^{−1} are driven to become a THz source, providing the trailing several-picosecond portion of the waveform. Upon strong irradiation, the macroscopic CO melting [22] quenches their infrared-activity and the ability of THz emission, resulting in the suppression therein.
A pump-probe experiment has been the standard strategy to resolve a fluence-dependent photoinduced phenomenon like that shown in Fig. 2. We also performed the optical-pump THz-emission-probe experiment at 124 K [Fig. 4(a)]. The THz emission, being a sensitive measure of the CO melting [19,50], was triggered by weak fundamental light (0.03 mJ/cm^{2}) at 1.55 eV introduced after the 0.89 eV pump through the chopper [also see Fig. 3(a)].
Figure 4(b) shows normalized time evolution of the photoinduced change of E_{THz}(ω) integrated over the whole frequency range (10 − 57 cm^{−1}). The observed decrease is due to the photoinduced CO melting deactivating the χ^{(2)} process, in accord with the photoinduced decrease of SHG [20]. Upon strong excitation I_{pump} = 0.23 mJ/cm^{2}, its decay rate slowed down without full recovery before 100 ps time delay [22]. The oscillatory component was also clearly observed, which is absent in the transient SHG. The time profile of ΔE_{THz}/E_{THz} in the range of 0 to 10 ps was well reproduced by the above three components; in Fig. 4(b), we also show fitting curves expressed as
where A and τ are the amplitudes and time constants of exponential decays [A_{slow} represents the slow (≫ 10 ps) decay] and ω and ϕ are the frequency and phase of the oscillation, respectively [51]. In the present discussion, τ_{fast},A_{fast}, and ω are relevant.
In Fig. 4(c), we plotted τ_{fast} and |A_{fast}| against I_{pump.} The decay time τ_{fast} notably increased with I_{pump}, indicating that CO-melted domains cooperatively interact to become stable macroscopic domains in the strong irradiation regime [22]. Correspondingly, the amplitude |A_{fast}| was as large as >30% above 0.2 mJ/cm^{2} with saturating behavior; this is comparable to entire melting of the CO, considering over 3 times shorter penetration depth of the pump light (0.5 μm) than that of the fundamental light (1.9 μm). The cooperative development of the macroscopic domains, accompanying the quenching of infrared activity of the intermolecular vibrations with a finite delay [Fig. 3(b)], should be responsible for the delayed suppression in the time-domain waveform around ∼2 ps [Fig. 2(a)] which also becomes emergent at the strong irradiation. In contrast, the shape of the first cycle of the waveform with a duration of ∼1 ps was found to be independent of fluence although the initial microscopic CO-melting occurs on a ∼0.02 ps timescale [23] accompanying the pump-induced decrease at 0 ps (within the current time resolution) shown in Fig. 4(b). This can be understood as follows: purely electronic polarization via the χ^{(2)} process, which is initially triggered upon photoexcitation (on a timescale of a field cycle of the incident light, ∼0.005 ps) preceding other photoinduced phenomena, is insensitive to the succeeding early dynamics of the CO melting, and thereby, the resultant first cycle does not show fluence-dependent modulation. Toward quantitative understanding, theoretical investigation is necessary, which is beyond the scope of this study.
ω was 38 ± 2 cm^{−1} at all measured I_{pump} values, which presumably corresponds to the infrared-active intermolecular vibration at 39 cm^{−1} [Fig. 1(c)]. This indicates that the photoexcitation triggers the vibration and it closely couples with the THz emission, supporting the aforementioned strong coupling. The oscillation of ΔE_{THz} is still seen at strong irradiation where the corresponding vibration loses its infrared-activity within 2 ps (Fig. 3). This indicates that the triggered vibration does not terminate upon the CO melting and accompanied lattice displacement modulates E_{THz}. On the other hand, a less significant oscillation amplitude (A_{osc}) compared to that at weak irradiation might be related to such an electronic change.
In summary, we have investigated the ultrafast modulation of the time-domain waveform of the THz electric field emitted from CO ferroelectrics α − (ET)_{2}I_{3} upon photoirradiation. While the waveform at weak irradiation shows slowly decaying oscillation and a narrow spectral shape, strong irradiation significantly suppresses the trailing portion of the waveform after the first cycle, resulting in spectral broadening more than 3 times in FWHM. This arises from the cooperative nature of photoinduced CO melting accompanying quenching of infrared-activity of the intermolecular vibrations which strongly couple with the THz emission.
