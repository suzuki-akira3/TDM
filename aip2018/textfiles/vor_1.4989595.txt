Influences of point defects on electrical and optical properties of InGaN light-emitting diodes at cryogenic temperature
We investigate the cryogenic external quantum efficiency (EQE) for some InGaN light-emitting diodes with different indium contents. We observe a monotonic decrease in EQE with the increasing forward current before the “U-turn” point, beyond which the thermal effect increases the EQE. We discover positive dependences among the droop rate (χ), differential electrical resistance (R_{d}), and indium content. Also, χ and R_{d} of individual green samples shift correspondingly during the aging test, when the Mg ions are activated at high injection density and diffuse into the active region. Considering the fact that both In and Mg ions would introduce point defects (PDs), we proposed a model that reveals the mechanism of interplay between PDs and carriers. PDs serve as both energy traps and non-radiative recombination centers. They attract and confine carriers, leading to an increase in R_{d} and a decrease in EQE.
I. INTRODUCTION
As light-emitting diodes (LEDs) enter the market of general lighting, research on elevating external quantum efficiency (EQE) of InGaN-based LEDs has become a hot research topic [1–8]. As expressed in Eq. (1), at a constant light extraction rate (η_{ex}), the EQE (η_{EQE}) is determined by the carrier injection rate (η_{in}) from layers of p- and n-GaN and the radiative recombination rate (η_{r}) in the active regions
η_{in} denotes the ratio between the number of carrier pairs injected into the active region and the number of total carrier pairs injected into the device per unit of time, and η_{r} denotes the ratio between the number of carrier pairs recombining radiatively in the active region and the number of total carrier pairs injected into the active region per unit of time. At room temperature (RT), a majority of holes in p-GaN are activated, yielding a current-independent η_{in}. In this case, the EQE depends largely on η_{r}. In 2007, Shen et_al proposed an ABC model, which has been widely employed in curve fitting for analyzing EQE curves ever since. Despite the popularity, it has caused controversies since the ABC model only attributes the large-J_{f} EQE droop to the Auger effect, simply ignoring some other processes, e.g., current leakage (η_{in} decreases at high J_{f}) [7] and recombination via extended defects [9,10]. In the low injection density region, however, researchers generally agree on the theory that the Shockley-Hall-Read non-radiative recombination via point defects (PDs) accounts for low EQE. In this theoretical framework, EQE at RT monotonically increases upon J_{f}, until carriers saturating PDs [1]. For some high-indium devices, large-scale fluctuations of the indium composition and/or the quantum well width generate local energy minima, which attract carriers and enhance their probability of radiative band-edge recombination. It manifests itself at the EQE-J_{f} curve as a spike [8]. The above-mentioned effects are all observed at temperature around RT. The dependence of EQE upon current appears very differently at cryogenic temperature, as a non-monotonic relationship has been observed by some research groups in both AlGaInN and InGaN systems [5,6,11–14]. At T <100 K, EQE decreases as J_{f} increases, which could not be well explained by the current form of the ABC model. Wang et_al and Lin et_al attribute the deviation to the non-uniformity of hole distribution in QWs, a consequence of inactive dopants in p-GaN [5,6]. A majority of frozen holes lead to a decrease in η_{in} with increasing J_{f}. As a consequence, for blue and green samples with high η_{r} at low-T, the EQE follows the change in η_{in}, decreasing with J_{f}. At RT, though still exists, the carrier imparity diminishes and becomes insensitive to forward current. While for UV-LEDs with very low η_{r} but normal η_{in}, its EQE exhibits little low-T-low-J_{f} EQE droop, since it is mainly determined by η_{r}. The prediction is consistent with the results in our previous work about UV-LED [11]. To study the EQE behaviors, one should first discern where lies the bottleneck, by making comparison between two devices with all but only one identical features.
In this work, we study cryogenic EQE behavior in the family of GaN-based multiple quantum well (QW) LEDs with identical layers of p- and n-GaN but of different indium contents. We measure the electroluminescence spectra (ELs) and forward voltages of these samples at low chamber temperatures (T_{c}). We observed that the low-J_{f} droop in EQE curves is more conspicuous in high indium samples than in lower ones. Interestingly, during a short-term current-aging test for green samples, the intensity of low-J_{f} EQE droop and the electrical resistances fluctuate correspondingly. Combining the results of EQE curves, I-V curves, and peak energy (E_{p}) of ELs obtained at the same time, we propose a model that explains the interaction of carriers and PDs in the QWs at different injection densities. This study demonstrates that, in addition to the hole injection rate in p-GaN, the PD concentration in the active region also affects the cryogenic EQE.
II. EXPERIMENT
The LEDs (1 × 1 mm^{2}) employed in this work are grown on the sapphire substrate by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition. They possess the identical epitaxial structures with those in our previous work [12], but have various indium contents in the active region, leading to different emission wavelengths: 517 nm green light (2.40 eV), 450 nm blue light (2.75 eV), and 370 nm UV light (3.35 eV). All the samples are identically encapsulated to avoid influences brought by the difference in packages. ELs are captured by a PMT-detector after being split by a monochromator in conjunction with a V/I measure unit (Keithley 2611), and T_{c} is controlled by a closed-cycle helium refrigerator system. During measurements, all data of V_{f}, EQE, and ELs are captured at the same time at certain levels of I_{f} parametrized with a series of T_{c}.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
1. Results and preliminary discussion
ELs of these samples measured at 25 K and 300 K under I_{f} = 5 mA are selectively illustrated in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b), respectively. The absolute EQE curves upon I_{f} measured at 25 K and 300 K for three samples are plotted in Figs. 1(c) and 1(d), respectively. The absolute values are approximately scaled to the ones measured at RT by using a spectrometer with an integrating sphere (Instrument System, Germany). No low-I_{f} EQE droop is witnessed for the UV sample as expected, and its EQE is about six times lower than for green blue samples, due to the low η_{r}. In this work, we make the comparison between green and blue samples, as they possess comparable η_{r}. They exhibit low-I_{f} EQE droops as the EQEs decrease and approach minima at 15 and 30 mA (1.5 and 3 A/cm^{2}), respectively. At higher I_{f}, EQEs decrease again, which is due to the increase in the large-current-induced temperature. Holes at the p-GaN layer are activated at higher temperature. As more holes are injected into the active region, the asymmetric carrier-pair injection is mitigated, leading to higher EQE. In this work, we mainly focus on the low- I_{f} EQE droops at J_{f} below 2 A/cm^{2}, where the thermal effect can be neglected. The droop rate can be measured by the droop rate around I_{0} = 1 mA to get rid of any thermal influences. The droop rate χ is defined as follows:
In Eq. (2), Δη_{EQE} and ΔI denote the small changes in EQE and current around I_{0}, respectively. For green and blue samples, χ(I_{0}), listed in Table I, reveals the fact that green samples exhibit stronger EQE droop than blue ones do. For more information, in Fig. 2, we present the detailed EQE curves over a wide range of T_{c} for green and blue samples along with the curves of I-V and of E_{p}-I measured at the same time. The results of green and blue samples are introduced and discussed as follows.
Curves of EQE-I for green and blue samples are plotted in Figs. 2(a) and 2(d), respectively. In the results of blue and green samples, the “EQE valley” becomes shallow as T_{c} increases and diminishes when T_{c} > 150 K. Compared with green samples, the blue samples exhibit a similar but shallower valley.
Curves of I-V for green and blue samples are shown in Figs. 2(b) and 2(e), respectively. For green samples at T_{c} =25 K, V_{f} increases fast until I_{f} reaches ∼10 mA (1 A/cm^{2}), where V_{f} shows a peak as it approaches the maximum and decreases thereafter. At large values of I_{f} near 250 mA, V_{f} reaches a minimum. As T_{c} increases, the whole I-V curve shifts downward, while the V_{f} peak diminishes and vanishes at 150 K. When T_{c} becomes higher than 150 K, V_{f} increases monotonically with I_{f}. Below 150 K, the decreases in voltage at current ranging from 30 to 100 mA are due to self-heating, which will be discussed in the Appendix section. The self-heating is neglected around low current, e.g., 1 mA; hence, there are little changes in Ohmic contact. For I-V curves of green and blue samples measured at 25 K, the slope of the I-V curve corresponds to differential electrical resistance (R_{d}). The values of R_{d} measured at 1 mA and 25 K of green and blue samples, listed in Table I, indicate its positive correlation with the indium content. Besides, all I-V curves shift downwards as temperature increases. It is an evidence of the thermal activation of p-GaN, i.e., more holes are released with increasing temperature and the electrical resistance reduces.
Curves of E_{p}-I for green and blue samples are illustrated in Figs. 2(c) and 2(f), respectively. For green samples, all peaks blue-shift with the increasing I_{f} for different T_{c} values. Those curves, measured for T_{c}< 150 K, exhibit a clear boundary at ∼10 mA; below this, the slope is gentle while steeper beyond it. The E_{p}-I curves of the blue sample are also similar but with blur boundaries.
We also conduct a current-stress aging test for green samples, during which these samples are subjected to I_{f} = 850 mA, and the heat-sink temperature is maintained at ∼340 K. The low-T measurement is carried out before (at 0 h), during (at 14 h), and after the aging (at 28 h). The junction temperature is merely 20 K higher than ambient temperature. In Fig. 3(a), where the shift of I-V and EQE- I_{f} curves is presented, strong correlations among these curves are observed. We distill the changes in these curves upon aging time into the shifts of two parameters: R_{d} and χ, which are illustrated in Fig. 3(b). During the first 14 h, R_{d} and χ are both decreasing, while they are both increasing during the second 14 h. Several previous studies have proved a passivation of p-GaN and an evolution in PDs in the active region during aging [15–18]. In the passivation, due to the impact of high carrier injection, Mg dopants are activated, and part of them diffuse into the active region mostly along dislocations [17]. This current-induced annealing effect on the one hand enhances the concentration of Mg ions and holes in the p-GaN. On the other hand, it causes diffusion of Mg ions into the active region, introducing PDs into otherwise defect-free sites [31]. One question then arises—if cryogenic EQE is solely determined by η_{in} in p-GaN, it should have experienced a monotonic increase during aging, and R_{d} and χ should have decreased monotonically as well, but why EQE, R_{d}, and χ all turn in the opposite direction in the next 14 h? To answer this question, it is reasonable to take into account the influence of the increasing PD concentration due to Mg intrusion into the active region, which is responsible for the more intensified droop and lower EQE during the period from 14 h to 28 h.
2. Theory of Trap-like PDs
The above-mentioned differences in the curves of EQE-I, I-V, and E_{p}-I in blue and green samples and the shifts in R_{d} and χ during aging both indicate that defect density in the active region could be responsible for the low-T-low-J_{f} EQE droop. Considering all these results, we propose that the modifications in R_{d} and χ over two samples and during aging reveal influences on PDs, which arise from the high indium content or intruded Mg ions. In high-In devices, indium ions tend to distribute inhomogeneously in the QWs, leading to indium segregation, which causes large-scale bandgap fluctuations [19]. On the other hand, the high indium content gives rise to the proliferation of small-scale PDs, such as Ga and N vacancies [20,21], in a manner of reducing the formation energy of these PDs [22,23]. In consequence, the PD densities in green samples are higher than in blue ones. As mentioned previously, at high injection density, the intruded Mg atoms from p-GaN will also induce PDs in the active region [15,17]. The PDs can function as transport centers for carrier tunneling during which carriers do not participate in radiative recombination but pass over the active region via trap energy levels formed by PDs, namely, defect-assisted tunneling (DAT) [24–26]. They would also modify the otherwise uniform bandgap. Harder et_al suggested that PDs would induce local energy increases in the bandgap nearby, forming barriers that expel carriers [27]. We further suggest that the PDs behave like non-radiative centers (NRCs) and slightly distort the energy band (Fig. 4). PDs belong to various species due to the different crystal structures, and they are either acceptor-like or donor-like. Mg ions substitutional to Ga belong to the former, and N vacancy, Mg_{Ga}–V_{N} complex, and Mg interstitial belong to the latter [28]. PD induced distortions in the bandgap are local energy minima. Taking a donor-like PD for example, after releasing an electron, it is positively charged, establishing a potential well which is able to attract nearby electrons. Thus, the potential around PDs should be smaller than that in neighboring areas. It is the same for acceptor-like PDs, which attract holes instead. PDs serving as non-radiative centers cannot form shallow energy levels. Instead, they are more likely to be origins of deep energy levels. Since a PD can attract carriers, it should also cause distortions at valence and/or conduction bands. These defects scatter over the QWs, making the potential distortions spatially separated. In consequence, electrons and holes are trapped separately, which severely reduces the radiative recombination rate. Maur et_al proposed a similar assumption of wave function separation in high indium InGaN LEDs [29]. Interestingly, the Ga vacancy is unstable at the low Fermi level, which can be occupied by intruded neighboring As atoms and are tuned from acceptor-like to donor-like. This process reverses at the higher Fermi level. In this case, the donor and acceptor are located at the same place but are temporally separated [30].
The carrier distribution at various situations is given in Fig. 4. In the following discussions, the low current range corresponds to I_{f} < 1 mA (J_{f} < 0.1 A/cm^{2}); medium current range starts from I_{f} = 1 mA (J_{f} = ∼0.1 A/cm^{2}) to the value at which the “U-turn” occurs; high current associates with large thermal activation beyond the “U-turn.” This model only deals with carriers having been injected into QWs. At low temperatures, carrier injection efficiency is limited at the low level due to poor dopant activation. At both low T_{c} and J_{f} (LTLJ), as given in Fig. 4(a), once carriers are injected into QWs, they recombine locally before being attracted by any nearby PDs. Thus, only a few carriers that happen to be injected at sites of PDs can be trapped, resulting in a very limited influence of PDs (estimated impact areas are marked by yellow-dashed lines and arrows). Since the existence of PDs enhances non-radiative processes, extreme LTLJ limits the PDs and leads to EQE saturation, as observed by Lin et_al at temperature below 25 K and injection current below 1 mA [6]. In our second-stage experiment, we extended the lower-limit of current to 0.01 mA (J_{f}=10^{−3 }A/cm^{2}) but still do not observed EQE saturation, as illustrated in Fig. 6 in the Appendix. Two possible reasons account for no EQE saturation: one is defect-assisted carrier tunneling (DAT), and the other is non-radiative recombination in defect levels. Both of them are associated with PDs. It is worth noting that, as proposed by Fedison, DAT occurs at low forward bias below the threshold voltage and exhibits little temperature sensitivity [25]. In our results, EQE droops at larger voltage beyond the threshold and the EQE curves show strong temperature-dependence. It is plausible that non-radiative recombination at defect levels, rather than DAT, dominates in the non-radiative process in our experiment. As a result, the exact values of current and temperature at which EQE is saturated rely on the PD concentration in QW. Therefore, strictly speaking, the temperature and current value in our work do not reach the saturation requirement of neither the blue nor the green samples. Such extreme conditions unfortunately are beyond the limit of the measuring system. According to the model proposed here, PDs capture few carriers at extremely low injection density and temperature, resembling staying in an inactive state.
As J_{f} increases, gaining a longer mean free path, carriers can travel farther but more likely to be captured by NRCs. The expanded NRC impact area increases the probability of carriers being captured by NRC before they recombine at the band edge. As a result, EQE decreases, as illustrated in Figs. 1(c), 2(a), and 2(d). Carrier mobility decreases as a consequence of diffusion being hindered, manifested in the V_{f} increase. These are illustrated in Figs. 2(b) and 2(e) at temperature below 100 K and forward current below 10 mA. The increased rate of V_{f} decreases with temperature, indicating the fact that the influence of NRCs reduces as temperature increases. Starting from this assumption, one could easily deduce that in cases of LTLJ, slightly enhancing the J_{f} would only make the carriers more susceptible to PDs (NRCs at the same time) in high-indium devices. One evidence is illustrated in Fig. 1(a), where ELs measured at 5 mA, 25 K, and EQE-I curves measured at 25 K of two samples are plotted. The EL intensity and EQE of the green sample at 5 mA are both lower than those of blue LEDs, exhibiting negative correlations between EQE with the indium content. Also plotted in Fig. 1(c) are the EQE-I curves, the EQE droop rate around 1 mA is higher in the green sample than in the blue one, as listed in Table I, showing a positive correlation, which reveals the fact that EQE decreases faster in higher indium devices. In Table I, a positive correlation is also witnessed between R_{d} and indium composition, which indicates the fact that carrier confinement is associated with the indium content under the LTLJ circumstance.
As J_{f} increases, the environment reaches a stage with low T_{c} and medium J_{f} (LTMJ), illustrated in Fig. 4(b). At this stage, a majority of carriers are trapped in NRCs, leading to the major decrease in both EQE and the carrier mobility but increase in V_{f}.
As J_{f} further increases, if T_{c} remains low (LTHJ), carriers should not be activated, and all PD-induced traps tend to be saturated [Fig. 4(c)]. However, in our experiment, the self-heating effect emerges with increasing current, the junction temperature rises, and more carriers, including holes in p-GaN, are released. The U-turn point marks the onset of the thermal effect, beyond which the chamber temperature increases to the level of RT, since the cooling system is not able to control the temperature at current higher than 100 mA. Since carriers are thermal activated, they are free from the confinement of NRCs, as will be described later. The EQE increases [Figs. 2(a) and 2(d)], V_{f} decreases [Figs. 2(b) and 2(e)], and EL blue-shifts [Figs. 2(c) and 2(f)] in this current region are all caused by an increase in temperature and are therefore not directly associated with indium-induced defects. Instead, the U-turn point is determined by the thermal management of sample package and the cooling system. A high-power cooling system is able to prevent this thermally induced U-turn at lower current. Note that the reason of this thermally induced U-turn is different from those previously reported [5,6]. We have not yet been sure whether there exist other processes, apart from the thermal effect, which increase the EQE at current beyond 10 mA in our samples. This issue remains to be tackled in the future. More details about self-heating are given in the Appendix.
In cases of high T_{c}, e.g., at RT, carriers are thermally activated. At high T_{c} and low J_{f} (HTLJ) in Fig. 4(d), prior to recombination, “warm” carriers travel farther than those at cryogenic temperatures. These carriers will probably be attracted by NRC traps located nearby within one mean-free-path, leading to larger impact areas of PDs, as marked by yellow-dashed lines and arrows [Fig. 4(d)]. At high T_{c} and medium J_{f} (HTLJ) in Fig. 4(e), NRCs are filled with carriers, whereas already-trapped carriers can also be thermally activated and escaped from NRCs, indicating that NRCs are saturated and their attraction on carriers reduced. In this situation, newly injected carriers tend to recombine near the band edge more readily than to be attracted by NRCs, resulting in higher EQEs. At high T_{c} and high J_{f} (HTHJ) in Fig. 4(f), QWs are filled with carriers and some electrons and holes leak to p-GaN and n-GaN, respectively, lowering the EQE again, leading to the commonly known room-temperature EQE droop.
In high T_{c} cases, since impacts of NRCs have been largely suppressed, especially beyond medium J_{f}, no fast V_{f} increasing with I_{f} in I-V curves is observed, and ELs blue-shift smoothly as J_{f} increases. Due to the difference in carrier motilities, the sizes of defect impact areas change significantly from LTLJ [Fig. 4(a)] to HTLJ [Fig. 4(d)]. Therefore, at LTLJ, though PDs exist, it exerts fewer influence on carriers surrounded, leading to a higher EQE than in HTLJ in which PDs have larger impact areas. It proves correct for the blue sample in Fig. 2(d), but fails for the green sample in Fig. 2(a), because it requires even lower J_{f} to manifest in high PD density devices. Unfortunately, due to high background noises, EQEs measured at lower J_{f} are not presented.
In addition to the above presented model, LTLJ EQE droop is also associated with the insufficient hole injection from p-GaN [6]. A strong carrier imparity would cause the EQE decrease with current at low T. With these theories in mind, the fluctuation of R_{d} and χ during the aging test can be well explained. In fresh samples, there inevitably exist some PDs in the active region, which induce the LTLJ EQE droop. During first 14 h, Mg ions in p-GaN are being activated. Mg-H bonds break at the high injection density and the increased temperature, and Mg ions are released from Mg-H complexes. The Mg ions act as p-type dopants that provide holes. The increase in the hole concentration increases hole injection density, which diminishes carrier imparity in QW. As a result, the EQE increases, V_{f} decreases at the same level of current compared with before the aging. Mg ions are accumulating, its concentration in p-GaN rises, and part of them starts intruding into the active region under current injection. They are impurities in the otherwise perfect lattice, dramatically increasing the PD concentration in the active region. According to the model we proposed, PDs boost EQE droop and forward voltage, and this is opposite to the effect of Mg activation in p-GaN. During the period from 14 h to 28 h, the effect of Mg immigration cancels the effect of Mg activation, resulting in a stronger LTLJ EQE droop, drawing down the EQE conductivity to the level even lower than at 0 h.
IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
In conclusion, we suggest that the droop rate could be influenced by PDs in the active region. At temperature lower than 100 K, when carriers in QWs are less activated, these PDs act as energy traps and NRCs that attract and confine carriers, making them recombine non-radiatively. The former effect leads to rise in R_{d} and χ at low J_{f}, and the latter results in the EQE decrease in the same J_{f} region. The attractions fade out as temperature approaches RT, at which carriers are thermally activated and no longer confined by PDs. The theory proposed in this article would shed light on the carrier kinetics in quantum-confined active regions of high indium devices.
APPENDIX
We compare the curves of I-V and V-I at an identical temperature of 25 K, which are illustrated in Fig. 5(a). In this appendix, the terms “V-I” and “I-V” mean “driven by voltage source and measure the current,” and “driven by current source and measure the voltage,” respectively. As expected, the I-V curve increases monotonously at first and then decreases but increases again at large I_{f}. The V-I curve exhibits the same trend of I-V in the current range beneath the V peak, as two curves largely overlap. Whereas as V_{f} continues to increase from the V peak by a very little step, we observe that the I_{f} could not be stabilized, and after a few seconds, it suddenly surges to some value beyond the measure limit (850 mA), which meanwhile heats up the sample and the chamber that is not able to be maintained at 25 K any longer. The quickly mass heating did not occur at the current-driven measurement.
According to the above-mentioned theory, this peculiar but interesting phenomenon is the consequence of uncontrolled carrier delocalization. Under the V driven condition, the V_{f} is controllable, while the J_{f} depends on carrier-carrier and carrier-lattice interactions within QWs. When the voltage is sufficiently low to release a significant amount of carriers, most carriers are confined just as they do in the I-driven case, and thus, J_{f} is as the same as in the I-V curve. When the V_{f} reaches the critical point (V peak in I-V) and slightly surpasses, a few carriers gain sufficient energy and start to escape from traps, which leads to the increase in I_{f}, as well as in electric power. The increase in electric power causes more heat generation and elevates the junction temperature, which in its turn reinforces the carrier activation. In such circumstance, carriers in QWs but also holes in p-GaN are activated. The series of actions trigger a positive feedback loop that ends up a widely thermal activation, which is the reason of surging in I_{f} and temperature. Nonetheless, in the I-driven case, since the V_{f} decreases when the carrier activation occurs, the input power decreases immediately and prevents the temperature from quickly increasing, which does not augment the carrier activation. In this case, suppression of the positive feedback loop ensures a steady increase in carrier activation with the increasing I_{f} (and slow but steady temperature increase). This is the reason of the V_{f} decrease beyond ∼10 mA at temperature lower than 100 K, as illustrated in Figs. 2(b) and 2(e). For LEDs operating at RT, however, there are few differences between two driving conditions, as illustrated in Fig. 5(b). As discussed above, at RT, the carrier confinement fades, as most carriers are thermally activated, which therefore are less sensitive to slight temperature fluctuations. In this case, the positive feedback loop could not be intrigued either, leading to identical behaviors in two driven conditions.
As illustrated in Fig. 6, EQE-I curves measured below 75 K, in the current range of 0.01–10 mA, corresponding to the injection density range of 0.001–1 A/cm^{2}. Below 0.01 mA, the light emission of samples is too weak to detect. Beyond 10 mA, the cooling system is not able to control the chamber temperature at a low value.
