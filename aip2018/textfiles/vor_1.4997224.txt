Electrostatic wave modulation in collisional pair-ion plasmas
The effects of ion-neutral collision on the electrostatic wave packets in the absence of the magnetic field in a pair-ion plasma have been investigated. Considering a two-fluid plasma model with the help of the standard perturbation technique, two distinct electrostatic modes have been observed, namely, a low-frequency ion acoustic mode and a high-frequency ion plasma mode. The dynamics of the modulated wave is governed by a damped nonlinear Schrödinger equation. Damping of the soliton occurs due to the ion-neutral collision. The analytical and numerical investigation reveals that the ion acoustic mode is both stable and unstable, which propagates in the form of dark solitons and bright solitons, respectively, whereas the ion plasma mode is unstable, propagating in the form of a bright soliton. Results are discussed in the context of the fullerene pair-ion plasma experiments.
I. INTRODUCTION
Pair plasmas consisting of positive and negative ions (without electrons) with equal masses have been studied intensively in the last few decades in theory [1–7] and in experiments [8–11]. The physics of pair plasmas is completely different from that of the normal electron ion plasmas. Pair plasmas are benefited by the space time symmetry in contrast to the normal electron ion plasmas with a wide mass difference. The symmetry arises due to the same mobility of the charged particles in electromagnetic fields. As a result, varieties of new physical phenomena have been studied in such symmetric pair plasmas. Pair plasmas consisting of electrons and positrons exist in the pulsar magnetosphere, early universe, active galaxy [12–15], and inertial confinement fusion reactor using ultraintense lasers [16]. Although pair plasmas consisting of electrons and positrons can be produced experimentally, it is very difficult to identify the collective modes because of the annihilation time, which is short in comparison to the plasma period [17].
However, in pair-ion plasmas composed of positive and negative ions, larger time scale can be considered. Therefore, no need to worry about the annihilation time in pair-ion plasmas. Such pair ion plasmas have been produced experimentally [18] by using positive and negative fullerene ions (C60±) as the ion source. These fullerene ions maintain a typical geometric arrangement containing 60 carbon atoms. This experimental result allows us to analyze new collective modes in pair-ion plasmas in a controlled situation. There is a huge prospect of usefulness of such types of pair-ion plasmas in nanotechnology and for the synthesis of dimers directly from carbon allotropes [19].
In experiments, three types of electrostatic collective modes were observed in such pair ion plasmas [20–23]: (a) low-frequency ion acoustic wave (IAW), (b) high-frequency ion plasma wave (IPW), and (c) intermediate-frequency wave (IFW). The frequency of IFW lies between the frequency of IAW and IPW. Theoretical studies of linear electrostatic and electromagnetic modes in pair plasmas have been carried out taking the kinetic [24] or the fluid dynamical model [25–27]. In fullerene pair-ion plasmas, when negative C60− ions collide with positive C60+ ions and/or neutral fullerene, dimers C_{60}, C_{120}, and C_{121} may be produced as a collisional product [28,29]. These dimers have acquired an interest from the standpoint of applications to nanoscale magnetic materials [30], nanotechnology, and fusion plasmas [29].
Recently, the effects of collisions with neutrals on propagation dynamics of linear electrostatic modes in pair-ion plasmas have been extensively investigated in the presence of a uniform external magnetic field [27]. In such a system, nonlinearity acts into play when wave amplitude becomes large. An intrinsic character of the nonlinear wave is the self-interactions. These self-interactions introduce self-focusing effects (modulational instability). In the absence of collisions, the wave modulation characteristics of electrostatic modes have already been investigated in pair-ion plasmas [4,31]. These investigations motivate us to investigate the nonlinear electrostatic wave modulations in one-spatial dimension in a pair-ion plasma in the presence of ion-neutral collision.
To study the nonlinear propagation of electrostatic modes, we have taken the two fluid equations to describe the model for two ion species and employed the standard reductive perturbation technique (RPT). Two distinct modes are derived the same as the experimental observation, namely, ion acoustic wave ω12=Cs2k^{2} (here, ω_{1},k, and C_{s} denote the frequency, wave number, and ion acoustic speed, respectively) and a ion plasma wave ω22=2ωp2+Cs2k^{2} with a cutoff frequency ω_{2}(k=0)=2ω_{p} (here, ω_{p} is the characteristic plasma frequency, common for both positive and negative ions). Finally, with the help of RPT, we have derived a dissipative (here damped) nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE). Damping arises due to the ion-neutral collision. After solving this damped NLSE numerically and analytically, we have obtained bright solitons and dark solitons. Also, we have observed that the damping causes the soliton (bright and dark) amplitude to decay with time.
The outline of this paper is as follows: in Sec. II, we demonstrate the complete set of two fluid equations to describe the model. In Sec. III, we derive the damped NLSE using RPT. In Sec. IV, we discuss the effect of ion-neutral collision on modulational instability. In Sec. V, we elaborately discuss about the soliton solutions and the collisional effects on these solutions. Finally, the results are summarized in Sec. VI.
II. PHYSICAL ASSUMPTIONS AND BASIC EQUATIONS
We have considered a homogeneous unbounded and unmagnetized pair-ion plasma system. The plasma constituents are positive and negative fullerene ions (C60+ and C60−) without electrons. As per the experimental observations [20–23], we have considered pair-ion plasmas with equal mass m_{+}=m_{−}=m(say) [where m_{±} is the positive (negative) ion mass] but slightly different [range of (0.3−0.5)eV] in temperature T_{+}≠T_{−} [where T_{±} is the positive (negative) ion temperature]. We have assumed that the plasma is in the equilibrium state at −∞, where electrostatic potential ϕ=0, positive ion number density n_{+}=n_{+0}, and negative ion number density n_{−}=n_{−0}. The plasma is overall quasi-neutral, and we have assumed that the ions are singly charged, and so, in equilibrium, the quasineutrality condition is satisfied, i.e., n_{+0}=n_{−0}=n_{0} (say).
Before going to the details of the physical model, we have introduced a new temperature variable T=(T_{+}+T_{−})/2. We have taken an explicit density dependence of the pressure in the form p_{±}=Cn±γ, where γ is the ratio of the two specific heats and C is a constant. As γ=(f+2)/f, where f is the number of degrees of freedom, in one dimensional cases, we have considered γ = 3 for one degree of freedom. In a weakly ionized pair-ion plasma, ions (positive and negative) suffer collisions with neutrals and with themselves. In a pair-ion (with equal mass and different temperatures) plasma, the positive (negative) ion-neutral collision frequency (ν_{±n}) can be estimated [32] as
where n_{n} is the neutral density and σ_{±n}∼5×10^{−15}cm^{2} is the scattering cross section. The positive ion-negative ion collision frequency (ν±c) can be estimated [32] as
where lnΛ∼(10−20) is the Coulomb Logarithm. Experimental observations [18,20–23] reveal that in equal mass pair-ion plasmas, the temperature of positive and negative ions is slightly different [range of (0.3−0.5)eV] due to the different charging processes. Numerical estimations show that within the observed temperature range, ν_{±n}≫ν±c, and therefore, we consider only the ion-neutral collisions.
We have taken all dependent variables as functions of coordinate variable x and time variable t. Therefore, the normalized two-fluid equations for the pair-ion plasmas with ion-neutral collision are as follows:
where the physical parameters σ_{±}=T_{±}/T and ν̃{±n}=ν_{±n}/ω_{p}. The space and time coordinates are normalized by the plasma Debye length (λ_{D}) and the inverse of plasma frequency (ω_{p}), respectively. The variable number density (n), electrostatic potential (ϕ), and velocity (u_{±}) of ions are normalized by n_{0}, T/e, and acoustic speed (C_{s}), respectively. The plasma parameters are the Debye length λ_{D}=(ϵ0γT/n0e2){1/2} and plasma frequency ω_{p}=(n0e2/ϵ0m){1/2}, where ϵ_{0} is the permittivity in free space. This defines the acoustic speed C_{s}(=ω_{p}λ_{D})=(γT/m){1/2}.
III. NONLINEAR EVOLUTION EQUATIONS
In order to analyze the propagation characteristics of nonlinear modulated waves in a pair-ion plasma from the basic model, Eqs. (1)–(3), we introduce the following slow space and time scales to observe the slow variation of modulated wave amplitude [33]:
where λ is the group velocity of the propagated wave to be determined later by the compatibility condition and ϵ is a small real parameter that characterizes the strength of nonlinearity. We expand all the physical quantities n_{±}, u_{±}, and ϕ in powers of ϵ in the following way:
The reality condition for all physical quantities is A−l(n)=(Al(n)){*}; the superscript star denotes the complex conjugates and Al(n) stands for n±,l(n),u±,l(n), and ϕ.
Note that in equal mass pair-ion plasmas, the collective modes of IAWs in the presence of collisions are not yet observed in any experiment. Therefore, to incorporate the ion-neutral collisional effects in the nonlinear regime, we consider (ν_{±n}/ω_{p}≪1), i.e., since we assumed that the ion-neutral collision frequency is much smaller than the plasma frequency. Thus, for consistency (between the assumption and perturbation), we consider the following scaling:
where ν_{±} is the proportionality constant which defines the normalized ion-neutral collision frequencies for positive and negative ions.
Now, to obtain the nth-order reduced equations (B1)–(B3) (details are given in Appendix B), we substitute the stretched variables [Eq. (4)], the expansion of the physical quantities [Eq. (5)], and the scaling [Eq. (6)] into the normalized Eqs. (1)–(3). For the first order (n = 1), first harmonics (l = 1), we obtain the following set of equations:
This system of equations determines the dispersion relation
of electrostatic wave in a pair-ion plasma. Solving this dispersion relation, we get two distinct modes of electrostatic wave in terms of frequency square (ω^{2}), which is defined as
When the wave number k is very small, these modes behave as
and
In dimensional form, we obtain the two modes as observed by experiment [18], namely, low frequency ion acoustic wave (lower mode) ω^{2}=Cs2k^{2} and high frequency ion plasma wave (upper mode) ω^{2}=2ωp2+Cs2k^{2}. The graphical representation of Eq. (13) with plasma parameters T_{+}=0.5eV and T_{−}=0.9eV is depicted in Fig. 1. The curves in this figure are in qualitative agreement with the modes observed in experiments.
The third mode in pair-ion plasmas, i.e., intermediate-frequency wave (IFW), which is observed in experiment [18], cannot be obtained in theory in the present studies. IFW has a strange feature that its group velocity is negative and phase velocity is positive, i.e., the mode is like a backward mode. However, Vranjes et_al [27] have studied a backward mode in pair-ion plasmas with electron impurities. They have shown that the electron plasma mode may become a backward mode in the presence of a density gradient.
In the second order (n = 2), first harmonics (l = 1), we obtain the following relations in the matrix form:
where the superscript T represents the transpose of the matrix. We also deduce the following group velocity term by the compatibility condition:
For next order (n = 2), we obtain the second-harmonic modes (l = 2) in terms of ϕ1(1)2
The expressions for A,B,C,D,E are given in Appendix A [see Eqs. (A1)–(A5)]. The second order zeroth-harmonic modes (n = 2 and 3; l = 0) that appear due to the self-interaction of the modulated carrier wave are obtained by the following relations:
The expressions for A_{1},B_{1},C_{1},D_{1} are given in Appendix A [see Eqs. (A6)–(A9)]. Finally, in third order first-harmonic modes (n = 3, l = 1), the coefficient of ϕ1(3) is zero by the dispersion relation, and the following nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE) for ϕ1(1)[=ψ] is obtained:
with a dissipative term Γ_{c}. The coefficient P in the NLSE known as the group dispersion coefficient is related to the curvature of the dispersion relation ω(k) [Eq. (12)], and Q is related to the nonlinear frequency shift. For the high frequency ion plasmas wave, P and Q are always positive depending on the wave numbers k (Figs. 2 and 3). However, P is always negative and Q is both positive and negative for the low frequency ion acoustic wave depending on the wave numbers k (Figs. 2 and 3). The dissipative term
is always positive for all wave numbers k (Fig. 4), which depends on the collision of ions with neutral particles. So, this dissipation term yields damping of the wave. We observe that from the expression of Γ_{c}, if the collision frequency ν_{±n} is zero, i.e., both ν_{+} and ν_{−} are zero, then, the dissipative term Γ_{c} vanishes. Thus, for the collisionless system (Γ_{c}=0), we can only get the NLSE without the dissipation term which generates a modulated wave with constant amplitude. On the other hand, for the collisional system (Γ_{c}≠0), we can get a damped NLSE, yielding a damped modulated wave whose amplitude decays with time.
IV. EFFECTS OF ION-NEUTRAL COLLISIONS ON MODULATION INSTABILITY
By assuming the fact that the neutral atoms collide with ions induces dissipation, the amplitude evolution equation (20) possesses the following plane-wave solution:
where ψ_{0}(τ) and Δ(τ) are the amplitude of the pump carrier wave and the nonlinear frequency shift in the presence of dissipation, respectively. We have substituted this plane-wave solution in Eq. (20) and got the following two equations:
and
where ψ_{00} is a real constant. Also, we have observed that ψ_{0}(τ)→0 as τ→∞ implies that ψ_{0} is stable. For stability analysis, we consider the perturbation about this stable solution in the following standard procedure:
where ψ̃(|ψ̃|≪ψ_{0}) is the perturbed amplitude of the modulated wave. Now, assuming a space-time dependence perturbation in the form ψ̃∼exp(iϑ), where ϑ=k̃ξ−∫0τω̃(τ´)dτ´ is the modulated phase with the wave number k̃(≪k) and the modulation frequency ω̃(≪ω), from Eq. (20), we have obtained the following dispersion relation:
From the dispersion relation [Eq. (26)], we have observed that the system is stable for PQ < 0. However, for PQ > 0, the system becomes unstable and the instability occurs known as modulational instability (or caviton instability in the case of one dimension) [34]. For PQ > 0, we must have both P and Q are of the same sign. In this particular problem, we have both the cases P < 0, Q < 0 and P > 0, Q > 0 for some different k. Keeping the collision in the system, the instability could occur if
which provides the following inequality:
This determines the maximum time τ_{max} to observe instability
which implies that the growth of instability will cease for τ≥τ_{max}. In the case PQ > 0, we have obtained a dispersion relation
for the instability growth rate by putting ω̃=iΓ in Eq. (26). Therefore, the maximum value of k̃{2} is
which yields the maximum growth rate
Thus, from the above relation, the instability occurs when 2|Q||ψ_{0}|^{2}>Γ_{c}.
In the case of the collisionless system, we can put Γ_{c}=0. So, in this case, it does not have any dissipation, and the dispersion relation of the modulated wave can be obtained by putting Γ_{c}=0 in Eq. (26) which reads as
Also, the instability criteria for PQ > 0 can be obtained in the same way which is
and the maximum growth rate
Comparing both the cases of collisional and collisionless systems, we obtain
as Γ_{c}>0.
V. SOLITON SOLUTIONS
In the above damped NLSE [Eq. (20)], for the ion acoustic mode, the group dispersion coefficient P [Eq. (A10)] is negative, and for the ion plasma mode, P is positive for small wave number k. However, for the ion acoustic mode, the nonlinear coefficient Q [Eq. (A11)] is both positive and negative depending on the wave number k, and for the ion plasma mode, Q is always positive. Now, to get the soliton solutions of the damped NLSE [Eq. (20)], we have normalized the equation in the following form:
where τ¯=|Q|τ,ξ¯=ξ|Q|/2|P|,ε(ψ)=Γ_{c}ψ/|Q|, and κ_{d}=κ_{n}=±1. The solutions of the normalized NLSE [Eq. (36)] determine nonlinear excitations, in the form of bright and dark solitons. This equation yields bright or envelope solitons for κ_{d}=−1,κ_{n}=−1, and κ_{d}=+1,κ_{n}=+1, whereas it gives dark solitons for κ_{d}=−1,κ_{n}=+1. We have solved Eq. (36) numerically for κ_{d}=±1,κ_{n}=±1 and also analytically. Analytical solutions in each cases are shown in following Subsections.
A. Bright soliton: Collisionless pair-ion plasmas
In the case of collisionless pair-ion plasmas, collisional frequency is zero, i.e., ν_{±}=0, and so, Γ_{c}=0. Therefore, we can put ε(ψ)=0 in Eq. (36). Now, we have the usual NLSE which is solved for the two different sets of values of κ_{d} and κ_{n}, which are κ_{d}=κ_{n}=−1 and κ_{d}=κ_{n}=+1. Solutions of this NLSE can be obtained using the inverse scattering transform. Let us consider that a solution is of the form ψ(y,t)=ρ(y)exp[iφ(y,t)], where y=ξ¯−Vτ¯ is a travelling wave coordinate and t=τ¯. Therefore, the amplitude of the wave envelope, |ψ|=ρ, is a travelling wave, moving with the group velocity λ plus the velocity V. After separating the real and imaginary parts, we solve the ordinary differential equation for φ and ρ (with the boundary condition ρ→0 as ξ→±∞). Finally, we obtain the following single bright solitons which are in terms of actual parameters:
where V is the velocity and “a” is the amplitude of the soliton. In the above solution, s_{1}=+1 for the set κ_{d}=κ_{n}=−1 and s_{1}=−1 for the set κ_{d}=κ_{n}=+1. This soliton shows that after they experience the collisions, they emerge with the same shape and velocity, also having an exponential factor, making the oscillation between maxima and minima. Numerically, a single bright soliton is depicted in Fig. 5 for different plasma parameters.
B. Bright soliton: Collisional pair-ion plasmas
In the case of collisional pair-ion plasmas, the collisional frequency, ν_{±}≠0, and therefore, Γ_{c}≠0. With this damping term (Γ_{c}≠0), Eq. (36) is not a completely integrable Hamiltonian system, and therefore, the system is not exactly solvable. However, we can obtain an approximate analytical solution of the damped NLSE [Eq. (36)] by using soliton perturbation analysis [35,36]. Therefore, we have assumed that the amplitude of the soliton is time dependent, and the general solution of this perturbed soliton is as follows:
where a, b, σ, and V¯ are the time dependent soliton parameters. Finally, applying the conservation laws for the NLSE (conserved integral relations), we obtain the following bright soliton (envelope soliton) in the presence of ion-neutral collision, which in terms of actual variable reads as
where a_{0} and V_{0} are the initial values of a and V, respectively. In the limit Γ_{c}→0, we recover the previous result [Eq. (37)] (with a_{0}=a and V_{0}=V). It is clear that as time elapses, the amplitude of the bright (envelope) soliton decreases exponentially with a decay rate ∼2Γ_{c}. The numerical solution in Fig. 6 also shows similar nature.
C. Dark soliton: Collisionless pair-ion plasmas
In this case, we have solved the NLSE [Eq. (36)] for κ_{d}=−1,κ_{n}=+1. Proceeding as before, we have obtained the dark soliton using inverse scattering transformation subject to the boundary condition ρ→a (a constant). Finally, we obtain a solution which is in actual parameter looks like [35,36]
where ζ=[aK|Q|/2|P|(ξ−2|PQ|Vτ)] and η=tan^{−1}[K1−K^{2}tanh(ζ)] and “a” is the amplitude of the dark soliton, V is the velocity of dark soliton, and K(0<K≤1) is an arbitrary parameter. Numerically, a single dark soliton is depicted in Fig. 7. Generally, dark solitons are also called a gray soliton when |K|<1 and a black soliton when |K|=1. So, in the case of |K|=1, from the above equations, we get black solitons as
D. Dark soliton: Collisional pair-ion plasmas
With this damping term (Γ_{c}≠0), Eq. (36) is not a completely integrable Hamiltonian system, and so, the system is not exactly solvable. Therefore, as earlier, we have assumed that the amplitude of the soliton is time dependent, and general solutions of dark (black) solitons are as follows [37,38]:
where a, b, σ, and V¯ are the time dependent soliton parameters. Now, applying the conservation laws for the NLSE, we have obtained
where a_{0} and V_{0} are the initial values of a and V, respectively. The dark soliton amplitude also decays exponentially with time having a decay rate ∼Γ_{c} due to the ion-neutral collision. The numerical solution in Fig. 7 also shows similar nature. In this case, the decay rate is half of that of the bright soliton. In the limit Γ_{c}→0, we recover the usual single dark soliton [Eq. (41)].
VI. CONCLUSIONS
In the preceding sections, we have demonstrated the nonlinear dynamics of the propagating IAWs and IPWs in the absence of the magnetic field in collisional pair-ion plasmas, by applying a two-fluid plasma model. The electrostatic wave packets are governed by a damped NLSE. The damping originates due to the ion-neutral collision. To observe the collisional effect on electrostatic wave modulation, we have assumed that ν_{±n}ω_{p}∼ν_{±}ϵ^{2} so that the collisional frequency is much smaller than the plasma frequency.
In our present study, we have obtained two distinct electrostatic modes, namely, a low frequency ion acoustic mode (lower mode) and a high frequency ion plasma mode (upper mode), where the temperature of the two ions is slightly different. These modes are observed by previous experiments [20–23], and here, also we get exactly the same modes. Adopting the standard reductive perturbation technique, the basic set of equations reduces to the dissipative (here damped) nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE) for the slowly varying electric potential. The ion-neutral collision is responsible for the dissipation on the governed NLSE. In the absence of collision, the present analysis reveals that the ion acoustic mode is either stable or unstable depending upon the wave number k. In the region PQ < 0, the ion acoustic mode is stable and propagates in the form of a dark (envelope) soliton. In the region PQ > 0, the ion acoustic mode is unstable and propagates in the form of a bright (envelope) soliton. However, the ion plasma mode is always unstable and propagates in the form of a bright envelope soliton. In the presence of collision, the amplitudes of bright and dark envelope solitons decrease exponentially with respect to time with decay rates ∼2Γ_{c} and ∼Γ_{c}, respectively. Finally, the results of our investigation could be useful to understand the modulated electrostatic waves in fullerene pair-ion plasmas.
In connection with the equal mass pair-ion plasma experiment, we must mention that we have not encountered any experimental observations of the nonlinear structures in pure pair-ion plasmas. However, many authors [39–45] have studied nonlinear waves (including wave modulations) in multi-component plasmas consisting of electrons and positive and negative ions. The experimental observations reveal that the amplitude of the density fluctuation n_{1}/n_{0}∼0.1 is sufficient to observe nonlinear wave phenomena in laboratory plasmas. Moreover, the experimental results are well explained by the small amplitude (weakly nonlinear) theoretical analysis. Recently, pure pair-ion plasmas (without electrons) consisting of fullerene ions are observed in experiment [20–23]. The masses of both the ions (positive and negative) are equal because they are generated by the same source (fullerene ion source), but their temperatures are slightly different due to the different charging processes of both the positive and negative fullerene ions [20–23]. Thus, we expect that in future, the nonlinear wave phenomena could be observed in such a plasma system, provided that the amplitude of the fluctuations are ≳0.1. Also, the investigation of collective phenomena in pair-ion plasmas is extremely important from a diagnostic point of view, and thus, the findings of the present investigation can be used in diagnosing the pair-ion plasmas.
