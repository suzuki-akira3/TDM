Dynamic quadrupole interactions in semiconductors
The time differential perturbed angular correlation, TDPAC, technique has been used for several decades to study electric quadrupole hyperfine interactions in semiconductors such as dynamic quadrupole interactions (DQI) resulting from after-effects of the nuclear decay as well as static quadrupole interactions originating from static defects around the probe nuclei such as interstitial ions, stresses in the crystalline structure, and impurities. Nowadays, the quality of the available semiconductor materials is much better, allowing us to study purely dynamic interactions. We present TDPAC measurements on pure Si, Ge, GaAs, and InP as a function of temperature between 12 K and 110 K. The probe ^{111}In (^{111}Cd) was used. Implantation damage was recovered by thermal annealing. Si experienced the strongest DQI with lifetime, τ_{g}, increasing with rising temperature, followed by Ge. In contrast, InP and GaAs, which have larger band gaps and less electron concentration than Si and Ge in the same temperature range, presented no DQI. The results obtained also allow us to conclude that indirect band gap semiconductors showed the dynamic interaction, whereas the direct band gap semiconductors, restricted to GaAs and InP, did not.
I. INTRODUCTION
In the field of nuclear solid state physics, the time differential perturbed angular correlation (TDPAC) technique or, for simplicity, PAC, has been applied to study the local atomic environment of solids, in general, and semiconductors, in particular, for several decades. Thanks to PAC spectroscopy, one can clearly understand about internal fields, defects, etc., in semiconductors over a wide temperature range.
Deicher et_al carried out PAC measurements in Si in the low temperature range from 8 K to 80 K and found that the dynamic interaction frequency decreases with increasing temperature, sharing the same trend as the fraction of ^{111}In atoms exposed to the perturbation. The distribution of electric field gradients (EFGs) at the probe sites does not depend on the measuring temperature in this range [1]. Pasquevich and Vianden investigated dynamic quadrupole interactions (DQI) in Si, Ge, GaAs, and InP and ascertained that the DQI in Si, Ge is strongly influenced by the temperature, whereas GaAs and InP experience no DQI [2–4]. Cordeiro et_al investigated defects in ultra pure silicon by means of TDPAC and also proved that above 600 K, the strength of the dynamic interaction is inversely proportional to temperature [5]. Muñoz et_al have recently studied dynamic hyperfine interactions in ^{111}In (^{111}Cd)-doped ZnO semiconductor and discovered that the strength of dynamic interaction reduces steadily above 700 K until it vanishes. The lifetime of the dynamic interaction, which is the mean time the electron holes are trapped at the probe atom, is directly proportional to temperature [6].
In our study, the PAC measurements were carried out between 12 K and 110 K in the semiconductors Ge, Si, InP, and GaAs after annealing to recover damage from implantation of the probe ions ^{111}In. The existence of dynamic interactions in this temperature range can be ascribed to fluctuating EFGs due to after-effects. The after-effects caused by electron capture decay of a PAC mother isotope, ^{111}In, result in a rearrangement of the electronic shell of the PAC probe atom. More specifically, S-orbitals from K, L shells of ^{111}In atom have a high probability of interacting with the nucleus where only one electron can be captured by a proton producing a neutron and a neutrino. In this process, the Z number decreases and all the electronic shells of the old parent element need to readjust to the new energetic conditions for the new element. This is quite a violent process with a lot of X-rays being emitted and, consequently, Auger electrons also being emitted leading to a highly ionized atom. In the very first femtoseconds, most of the inner shells are reconstructed using their own atomic electrons. Then, while the potentials are still too strong from the highly ionized atom, the nearby elements will provide some of the missing electrons. After a few picoseconds, depending on the electron mobility and on the equilibrium configuration of the element in the host matrix, only a few electrons will be missing from the outer shells, with a small amount of energy required to finally recover. We are then in the nano-microsecond regimes that are characteristic times for electrons moving in semiconducting or semi-insulating compounds. If the daughter element could recover all missing electrons up to the equilibrium, within a few picoseconds, no after-effects will be observed by PAC. If equilibrium is not achieved in the nano-microsecond time range, then the PAC observation can reveal the relaxation and recombination processes and therefore provide information about electron dynamics and the equilibrium charge state of that impurity in the host matrix [7]. According to the model proposed by Lupascu et_al [8], the occurrence of unidirectional relaxation, i.e. the initial state can only change to a final state but not vice versa, causes fluctuating EFGs. Due to these fluctuating EFGs, the electric interactions become dynamic interactions or time-dependent interactions. Such a relaxation is observable by PAC if the relaxation time is in the appropriate time scale. Specifically, for the after-effects, the amplitude of the dynamic EFG in the spectra decreases with temperature because the electron mobility and recombination rate increase, thereby accelerating rearrangement of the electron shell and thus pushing the after-effects out of the observable time window.
The models for the after-effects were established since several decades ago by many scientists such as Bäverstam and Othaz [9], Lupascu [10]. In this study, the Bäverstam and Othaz model was used and good agreement with experimental results was found. However, Lupascu's model was only dedicated to oxide semiconductors, not to pure elemental semiconductors, and therefore it could not be used in the data analysis.
In this study, it is expected to find an influence of the band gap size on the after-effects and DQI because, in large band gap semiconductors, the number of conduction electrons is less than that in small gap ones at the same temperature [11]. Therefore, the number of holes bound to the probe might be higher, leading to a stronger dynamic interaction.
II. TIME DIFFERENTIAL PERTURBED ANGULAR CORRELATIONS
The TDPAC technique will be briefly described in this section with the focus on dynamic interactions. More details can be found in Refs [12] and  [13]. When radioactive nuclei with suitable nuclear moments decay through a cascade of two gamma rays and experience external electric and/or magnetic fields, the hyperfine interaction takes place within the lifetime t of the intermediate state between the two gammas. The external electric field is the electric field gradient (EFG) resulting from the charge distribution present in the immediate neighborhood of the probe atom ^{111}In/^{111}Cd. The interaction between this EFG and the electric quadrupole moment Q of the intermediate state of the probe nucleus is called electric quadrupole interaction (EQI). The EQI causes the perturbation of angular correlation of two gamma rays emitted from excited states of ^{111}Cd, which are populated after the emission channeling (EC)-decay of ^{111}In (see Fig. 1). The EQI can be static or dynamic corresponding to static or dynamic EFG. The static EFG results from the stable charge distribution existing in the direct vicinity of the probe, whereas the dynamic EFG originates from a charge fluctuation of the environment on the same time scale as the lifetime of the intermediate state. The dynamic EFG has been ascribed to after-effects which arise due to the electron capture decay of the probe nucleus ^{111}In (^{111}Cd). Specifically, ^{111}In decays to ^{111}Cd by electron capture and has a half-life of 2.8 days, Q = +0.83(13) b and μ = −0.7656(25) μ_{N} [12] allowing to study after-effects [8], magnetic or/and electric hyperfine interactions on the time scale of around 400 ns due to the relatively long half-life value of the intermediate state, 84.5 ns. The metastable state^{111m}Cd of ^{111}Cd, in turn, decays to its ground state by emitting a gamma cascade as displayed in Fig. 1. Using PAC spectroscopy, we can measure the transition frequencies, ω_{n}, of sublevels in the intermediate state by using the theoretical functions to fit the experimental spectra. The obtained values provide information about the host lattice surroundings of the probe in terms of crystalline structure and electromagnetic properties.
In the case of a static axially symmetric EFG where the individual EFGs are randomly oriented in the sample, the angular correlation only depends on the angle θ between the emission directions k_{1}→ and k_{2}→ of two gammas [12]
where G_{kk}t=∑n=0n_{max}s_{kn}cos(nωQ0t).
Here, the terms with k > 2 are neglected since they are very small for ^{111}Cd. P_{2}cosθ is a Legendre polynomial. For simplicity, θ was chosen to be 90° and 180°, and P_{2}cos180°=1; P_{2}cos90°=−12. Thus
In Eq. (2), the term R(t) is the count-rate ratio and A_{22} is the anisotropy coefficient which is −0.18 for the 172–245 keV gamma ray cascade [12]. This value is only valid for point-like detectors. For the finite size of the detectors, the mean values of anisotropic coefficients were used. They were determined with the help of Monte Carlo simulation using the Monte program [14,15]. G_{22}(t) is called the perturbation factor, containing information about the interaction. It depends on the asymmetry parameter η=(V_{xx}−V_{yy})/V_{zz}, where V_{ii} are the principal components of the EFG tensor, and the angle between k→{1} and k→{2} which are the emitting directions of the two gamma rays γ_{1} and γ_{2}, respectively, the orientation of the EFG and the position of the detectors relative to the crystal lattice. G_{22}(t) has different forms according to the type of hyperfine interaction. For inhomogeneous broadening static quadrupole interaction G_{22}(t) has the form [35,39,40]
where ω_{0}=0 [Ref [40], Eq. (78)], and ω_{1},ω_{2},ω_{3} are defined as a function of asymmetry parameter [39]η
with
β=801−η^{2}/2833+η2{3/2}, and ω_{Q}=2πeQV_{zz}4I2I−1h=eQV_{zz}40ℏ (for I = 5/2) is quadrupole interaction frequency [12].
In Eq. (3), f_{i} is the fraction of the probe atoms located in the environment i (i = 1,2,…) and the f_{i} must satisfy ∑if_{i}=1. The sneff values have distinct definitions depending on single crystalline or polycrystalline samples [40]. For single crystalline samples used in our study, they depend on the orientation of the principal axis of the EFG within the lattice and the detector orientation in respect to the lattice directions of the sample. The exponential function accounts for a Lorentzian frequency distribution of relative widths or dampings (FWHM) δ_{i} around ω_{n} because of slight variations in the EFG resulting from inhomogeneous lattice structure near the probes [16,35,42].
In the case of wide distribution of low frequencies, it is convenient to take the limit ω_{Q} → 0 in Eq. (3) to obtain [2]
In Eq. (4), ω_{n,i} = ω_{i} are mean angular interaction frequencies [2–4]. For simplicity, ω_{i} are replaced by ω_{i}.
III. THE BÄVERSTAM AND OTHAZ MODEL FOR THE AFTER-EFFECTS
According to the Bäverstam and Othaz model [9], the dynamic interactions can be characterized by the relaxation constant (rate) λ_{r} and recovery constant (rate) λ_{g}. The relaxation constant λ_{r} represents the strength of the dynamic interaction and τ_{g}=1λ_{g} is the life time of the dynamic interaction, i.e. the time the holes are bound to the probe atom.
The Bäverstam and Othaz model for the after-effects is based on the Abragam and Pound theory [13]. The time-dependent contribution to the perturbation factor can be defined as
G22Dt is assumed to be a perturbation factor for the dynamic interaction happening at sites having cubic static symmetry. In Eq. (5), the first term G22D1t stands for the dynamic part and the second one G22D2t represents the ultimate static interaction since the hyperfine interaction will be static once the excited atoms reach their ground state. The perturbation factor for dynamic interaction G_{22}(t) can be expressed as
where G22st is the perturbation factor for the purely static interaction. For cubic lattice structures, the static EFG vanishes. Therefore, G22st=1 and Eq. (6) becomes Eq. (5).
According to the Bäverstam and Othaz model, there are two kinds of atomic fractions involving the electric quadrupole interaction. Therefore, Eq. (4) becomes
The parameter f_{1} is the fraction of atoms participating in the dynamic interaction and called the dynamic fraction, while f_{2} is the fraction of atoms measured in a static environment and is called the static fraction. The sum of f_{1} and f_{2} equals 1.
In cubic symmetry lattices, the static quadrupole interaction vanishes. Therefore, ω_{2}=0, and Eq. (7) becomes
In order to evaluate the dynamic interaction, Eq. (8) was fitted to the experimental PAC spectra using Nightmare [14] software to extract the hyperfine parameters by a least squares method. Using the Nightmare program, which is a special program developed by Nédélec [14] for fitting PAC spectra, the function in Eq. (3) was programmed as a Least Squares Fitting Function to fit all PAC spectra of either static or dynamic interactions and then giving us the corresponding parameters of each interaction. The function in Eq. (3) should not be understood as a model function used only for inhomogeneous broadening static quadrupole interactions. When fitting for static PAC spectra, for example, the spectra for as-implanted samples, the extracted parameters are considered as static parameters. However, for dynamic interactions, the PAC spectra were fitted by the Least Squares Fitting Function providing us appropriate results for f_{1}; ω_{0}; δ, which are defined as not vanishing dynamic parameters. These parameters are related to λ_{r}andλ_{g} in the Bäverstam model as presented below [41]
For simplicity, δ_{1} and ω_{1} are replaced by δ and ω. Here, δ is the dynamic damping, which is the relative width of the Lorentzian distribution around the mean angular dynamic interaction frequency ω. From Eq. (9), it should not be concluded that both λ_{r} and λ_{g} only depend on the mean interaction frequency. They are expected to change as a function of measuring temperature.
IV. EXPERIMENTAL METHOD
The semiconductors measured in our study were Si, InP, GaAs, and Ge. The ^{111}In probe implantations were carried out at the Bonn Radioisotope Separator, BONIS, at the Helmholtz-Institut für Strahlen-und Kernphysik (HISKP), University of Bonn, Germany. Relying on former studies by our PAC group, all the implantations in this study, except for Si, were made with energy of 160 keV at the incident angle of 10° and fluence on the order of 10^{12} ions/cm^{2}. For Si, Kaufmann et_al [17] implanted ^{111}In with 90 keV. In this case, the projected range is 40 nm with a depth distribution of 12 nm [18]. The implantation energy makes sure that the probe ions are deeply implanted into the semiconductor and it depends on the masses of the probe ion and the atoms in the sample. The implantation depth is estimated to be 30 nm from the surface by SRIM 2008 (Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter) calculations [19]. A suitable incident angle of ion beam is also very important to prevent channeling effects and avoid a deeper implantation profile than desired [20,21].
Ion implantation is a popular method to embed the probe atoms into solids, because it avoids chemical interactions of solutions or similar with the sample under investigation. However, the disadvantage of this method is that the implantation processes cause damage to the lattice structure. This can be removed by a Rapid Thermal Annealing Apparatus (RTA) in most cases. All the samples in our study were annealed in vacuum for 2 min with proximity caps, which are non-implanted samples, to maintain surface integrity. The annealing temperatures for all samples in this study are summarized in Table I.
The as-implanted samples were measured at room temperature, 295 K. Then, after annealing, measurements were performed at low temperature. For this, the samples were mounted in a cryogenic system, which consisted of two components: the compressor containing helium gas and the expander module where the low temperature is generated from 12 K to 300 K. The sample orientation did not affect the PAC spectra since the samples have a cubic symmetric lattice. Therefore, the EFG is created by the incomplete electron shells. In order to observe the dynamic quadrupole interactions, all the annealed samples were measured at low temperatures since at low temperatures the holes produced by electron capture after-effects can be bound to the probe nuclei in a time which is long enough for the hole charge distributions to perturb the angular correlation.
V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Figure 2 shows PAC spectra taken after implantation. These spectra correspond to a wide distribution of large static quadrupole frequencies caused by asymmetric charge distribution around the probe nuclei which can be ascribed to radiation damage produced by the implantation process. The obtained static angular interaction frequencies ω are quite large, ranging from 156(4) Mrad/s to 210(14) Mrad/s, and they are broadly distributed because of high damping values, varying from 38(2)% to 129(16)%, as shown in Fig. 2. These damping values reflect that the environments surrounding ^{111}In are non-uniform, and therefore the EFGs are not homogeneous.
The perturbations of the angular correlation are partially removed by annealing at high temperatures as shown in Fig. 3. After thermal annealing, most of the probe atoms replace the host lattice atoms and become located at sites of cubic symmetry, leading to a vanishing EFG. The substitutional sites occupation of the ^{111}In nuclei in the host lattice of Si and Ge has been confirmed using the emission channeling (EC) technique at ISOLDE (CERN) [25], with a maximum occupation of 90%. These values were compared with the ab initio calculations, the pseudopotential-plane-wave method as well as the all-electron Kohn-Korringa-Rostoker method [26] and obtained good agreements. Takai et_al [27] applied 1.5 or 1.8 MeV^{4}He^{+} channeling techniques to study the lattice location of Indium implanted in GaAs and indicated a high fraction of In at the substitutional sites. In the case of InP, it is very probable that ^{111}In occupies an Indium site because they have an identical atomic size.
After measuring the annealed samples at room temperature, the measurements were carried out in vacuum at low temperatures varying from 12 K to 110 K at which the dynamic interaction is expected to occur due to after-effects. The strength and lifetime, two main characteristics of dynamic interaction, will be analyzed and discussed below.
A. The strength of the dynamic interaction
The dynamic quadrupole interaction observed at the lowest and highest measured temperature can be graphically described by the PAC spectra in Fig. 4. The strength of the dynamic interaction is characterized by the relaxation rate λ_{r}, which follows an upward trend with an inverse temperature for Si and Ge. For InP and GaAs, in contrast, this parameter is almost zero because of null mean angular interaction frequency [Fig. 5(b)], leading to the conclusion that the dynamic interaction does not happen in InP and GaAs at the temperatures investigated. The change of λ_{r} with temperature obeys the power-law fit function λ_{r}=C.T^{−α}, where α = 0.86 ± 0.06 and α = 0.75 ± 0.02 for Si and Ge, respectively, as shown in Fig. 7(a). Besides, theory has revealed that the mobility in silicon and germanium dominated by acoustic phonon interaction is expected to be proportional to T^{−3/2}, while the mobility resulting from optical phonon scattering is only expected to be proportional to T^{−1/2}. Experimental values of the temperature dependence of the mobility in silicon and germanium are μ∼T^{−2.4} for Si and μ∼T{−1.7} for Ge [32]. Therefore, it can be assumed that the temperature dependence of the strength of the dynamic interaction correlates with the variation of electron mobility with temperature. This assumption contradicts the Bäverstam and Othaz model [9] that λ_{r} does not depend on the atomic surroundings. In fact, some recent studies have also allowed people to claim the dependence of λ_{r} on the local environment of the host like electric conductivity [38] σ. In addition, among the studied samples, Si has the highest value of λ_{r}, followed by that of Ge, at a measuring temperature ranging from 12 K to 110 K [Fig. 7(a)]. This property is also visibly reflected by spectra in Fig. 4 where the spectra for Ge are less fluctuating than those for Si in the first nanoseconds. These results will be discussed below.
It can be seen from Fig. 7(a) that the dynamic interaction is much stronger when the temperature is lower than 40 K and it becomes weaker when the measuring temperature increases up to 110 K. This is reflected by the gradual decrease in λ_{r} from the highest value of 19.4(9) μs^{−1} to 2.2(1) μs^{−1} and from 3.67(6) μs^{−1} to 0.68(1) μs^{−1} for Si and Ge, respectively. The magnitude of the dynamic interaction depends partly on the fraction of atoms f_{1} involved in dynamic interaction, the mean angular interaction frequency, and damping. In fact, for both these samples, from Fig. 5(a), the dynamic fraction f_{1} decreases steadily with rising temperature, whereas the opposite is true for the static fraction f_{2}. As the fraction f_{2} increases with rising temperature, it means that the higher the temperature, the more probe atoms are exposed to a static EFG. The explanation for this observation is the increasing number of conduction electrons at high temperature. These electrons can fill the electron hole states created by the Auger process in the after-effects, leading to the static EFG surrounding the probe atoms. This explanation, relying on the conduction electrons, can be considered as a model and it is not completely true for all samples, but in this case it could be a good explanation. For InP and GaAs, the fractions that are ascribed to the static fractions are always 100%. In these systems, the dynamic interactions are assumed to relax much quicker than the actual measurement time. Figure 5(b) presents the temperature dependence of the mean angular dynamic interaction frequencies ω which are inversely proportional to measuring temperature. Moreover, the values of ω in Si are highest, followed by Ge in the measuring temperature range. The mean interaction frequencies for Si are narrowly distributed because of small fluctuations of the EFG characterized by less damping δ, from 55% to 88% [Fig. 5(c)], whereas the opposite is true for those in Ge. For the probe atoms contributing to static interactions (fraction f_{2}), the mean interaction frequencies ω are always zero because these probe atoms are located on cubic sites and have complete electron shells, leading to vanishing EFGs.
We can conclude that λ_{r} increases when the temperature decreases, which means that the lower the temperature, the stronger the dynamic interaction becomes for Si and Ge. This property of the dynamic interaction can be explained by the after-effects. The K, L shells of ^{111}In have a high probability of interacting with the nucleus where one electron can be captured by a proton and leave a hole [7]. Due to the Auger process and means of radiative transitions, the hole can move from inner shells to the outer shell. The Auger cascade ends with highly ionized ^{111}Cd atoms and a distribution of holes for the different decay processes [9]. The inner shells of the ion will be filled in the femtosecond range, but the outer shell actually needs external electrons to fill the holes to become complete. While the holes have not been filled, which means they are still being bound to the probe, the fluctuating EFG can be produced [6,8,35], and therefore the dynamic interactions take place. At higher temperature, the magnitude of the EFG would be lower since the holes may move to excited orbits of larger radius [2], leading to weaker dynamic interactions. However, the measurements at low temperature for InP and GaAs show no dynamic interactions. This could be due to the fact that for higher average atomic number of the group III–V host, the bonds between valence electrons in the outermost shell and the atomic nucleus are really weak [4,28]. Therefore, these valence electrons can easily be removed from host atoms, becoming conducting electrons even at low temperature. Then, the holes can be filled by these conducting electrons, resulting in a vanishing EFG. Another explanation could be the higher thermal velocity of conducting electron, v_{th}=3kTm*, in GaAs and InP compared to that in Si and Ge at the same temperature. In fact, conductivity effective masses of electron m* in GaAs and InP are 0.07m_{o} [11] and 0.073m_{o} [29], respectively, which are much less than those in Si (0.33m_{o} [11]) and Ge (0.12m_{o} [30]), leading to a high value of thermal velocity. Therefore, the conducting electrons in GaAs and InP might fill the holes faster even at low temperature, resulting in no fluctuating EFGs and therefore no dynamic interaction.
The substantially strong dynamic interactions in Si can be explained by the fact that after being implanted into Si, the probe atoms can populate both substitutional sites and tetrahedral interstitial sites [2], whereas in Ge only a population of the substitutional sites by the probe atoms is found [31]. Therefore, the fluctuating EFG in the Si lattice can be produced by the combination of the electron-capture (EC) after-effects at two different sites [2], while the EC after-effects only take place at one site in the Ge lattice. This leads to the fact that the magnitude of the EFG in the Si lattice is much higher than that in Ge, which means that the dynamics interaction in Si is stronger. Furthermore, in this case, the electron-phonon scattering phenomenon might cause a strong influence on the recovery from the after-effects. According to the research of Tandon et_al [37], at very low temperature near 0 K, the electron–phonon (e-ph) scattering rate in Si is higher than that in Ge. The high e-ph scattering rate might prevent free electrons from filling the holes, which means that free electrons might take a longer time to fill in the holes in Si than in Ge. Therefore, the number of holes in Si might be higher than those in Ge for the same time interval, leading to stronger fluctuating EFGs or stronger dynamic interaction.
The main difference, i.e. no dynamic interaction in GaAs and InP and stronger dynamic interaction in Si and Ge, is that the first two are direct band gap semiconductors, whereas the second two are indirect band gap semiconductors. Moreover, electron mobility in these semiconductors varies as a function of temperature such that μ∼T^{−2.4}; μ∼T^{−1.7}; μ∼T^{−1.0} for Si, Ge, and GaAs, respectively [32]. Therefore, at the same measuring temperature, GaAs has the highest electron mobility. This is followed by Ge and Si which has the lowest electron mobility. For InP, to our knowledge, the change of electron mobility as a function of temperature has not been reported. However, Adamski [33] reported that at 77 K, electron mobility in InP has a value up to 130 000 cm^{2}/V s, which is certainly much higher than that in Ge and Si at the same temperature. Therefore, band-gap type and electron mobility directly relate to the magnitude of dynamic interaction.
Among the four studied semiconductors, Ge has the smallest band gap, whereas GaAs has the largest band gap in the measuring temperature range as shown in Fig. 6. In large band gap semiconductors, the number of conduction electrons at a certain temperature is less than that in small ones due to the expression [11]n_{i}≈N_{c}N_{v}×exp(−E_{g}2k_{B}T); therefore, the number of holes bound to the probe might be greater, leading to a stronger dynamic interaction. This argument contradicts the obtained result that there are no dynamic interactions in GaAs and InP. Therefore, we could conclude that apparently there are no direct influences of the different band gap size and electron concentration on dynamic interaction.
B. The lifetime of dynamic interaction
The upward behavior of lifetime τ_{g} versus temperature is shown in Fig. 7(b) with the upper one for Ge and the lower one for Si. The lifetime τ_{g} of Ge is much higher than that of Si at the temperatures studied, being in the range from 117(2) ns at 12 K to 516(10) ns at 110 K. When the observed time t >τ{g}, which is marked by dashed lines in Fig. 4, the dynamic interaction will switch off and this time interval only shows static interaction. Therefore, during the observed time t of PAC spectra of both Si and Ge samples, there is the combination of static and dynamic interactions which agree well with expression (5) in the Bäverstam and Othaz model. The increase in lifetime τ_{g} with temperature shows that the dynamic interaction exists longer at higher temperature. Our study shares the same result with the research on dynamic interaction in pure and Sn-doped In_{2}O_{3} semiconductors carried out by Bibiloni et_al [35] at the same temperature range.
The result obtained contradicts our expectation that the lifetime of dynamic interaction should be shorter at higher temperature. In fact, the number of conduction electrons might homogeneously increase in Si and Ge at high temperature [36]. If it is true, at higher temperature, the mean distance from the conduction electron to the hole should decrease. If we assume that all electrons move with the same constant speed, the time the electrons need to fill the holes created by the after-effects should be shorter. Therefore, the holes might be bound to the probe for a shorter time at higher temperature. This experimental result proved that our expectation was incorrect. The increase in dynamic lifetime τ_{g} with rising temperature can be related to the electron–phonon interaction effect [35], which has been thoroughly presented in the research of Tandon et_al [37] This group reported ab-initio results for electron-phonon (e-ph) scattering at 0 K and 300 K. In particular, the carrier concentration of Si has been predicted to be reduced by about 45% in thermal conductivity due to e-ph interactions because optical and acoustic phonons have been claimed to contribute significantly to e-ph scattering, especially in GaAs, contrary to earlier understanding [37]. The reduction of the carrier concentration is assumed to increase with rising temperature, thus giving a chance to the holes to be bound to the probes for longer at higher temperature. Moreover, the results of computing scattering rates in Si using the imaginary part of electron self-energy have shown that 1 eV above the local conduction band minima the lower scattering rates have been observed due to the presence of L valley [37]. Therefore, a mean time interval between two collisions might be longer, which means that the conducting electrons might need more time to fill in the holes, leading to a long lifetime of dynamic interactions.
VI. COMPARISON WITH PREVIOUS STUDIES
Some experimental results obtained are in good agreement with those reported in previous studies. The PAC spectra obtained after removal of radiation damage strongly depend on temperature. The relaxation parameter λ_{r} increases with the inverse temperature for Si and Ge [2,4–6]. The distribution of EFGs is independent of temperature [1], which is characterized by a constant value of the damping δ in the cases of Si and Ge measured above 40 K [Fig. 5(c)]. Furthermore, the dynamic interactions in Si are much stronger than that in Ge, reflected by the relaxation parameter [2,4] λ_{r}. Last but not least, the lifetime of dynamic interaction, the time the holes are bound to the probe atoms, increases with temperature, which is in good agreement with Muñoz et_al [6] and Bibiloni et_al [35] However, there are some differences between our experimental results and their results. In their study, the dynamic interaction happens in GaAs at low temperature, i.e., from 20 K to 100 K although it is much weaker than that in Si and Ge [4]. In our experiment, the dynamic interaction does not exist in GaAs in the same temperature range. The reason for this may be that the quality of GaAs used in this experiment was better than that used by Pasquevich and Vianden many years ago. Also, their result showed that for Si from 20 K to 80 K, τ_{g} remains constant and is very large, which means that the dynamic interaction does not vanish [2]. In our case, τ_{g} increases with temperature T which means that the dynamic interactions exist for longer at higher temperature.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
The TDPAC technique has been successfully applied to study electric quadrupole hyperfine interactions in semiconductors such as Si, Ge, GaAs, and InP. The EFG originated from two possible sources: static defects and the after-effects. After annealing to remove damage, the lattices recover their cubic symmetry, so the EFG vanished in the cubic lattice samples. For the samples studied at low temperatures ranging from 12 K to 110 K, the binding of holes created by the after-effects to the probe nuclei leads to a fluctuating EFG. Therefore, the electric interaction was dynamic at low temperatures.
The Bäverstam and Othaz model has successfully described the dynamic interaction via the change of the relaxation constant λ_{r} and the lifetime of dynamic interaction τ_{g} with T, where λ_{r} represents the strength of the dynamic interaction and τ_{g} is the lifetime of the dynamic interactions. In the temperature range measured, λ_{r} decreased with rising temperature, which means that the dynamic interaction was weaker at higher temperature. Furthermore, the strength of dynamic interaction is different for the various semiconductors. The dynamic interactions in elemental semiconductors like Ge and Si were much stronger than those in compound ones like GaAs and InP. Also, the results show that the dynamic interactions did not occur in annealed GaAs and InP at all the measurement temperatures. Regarding τ_{g}, it increases with the temperature T, which means that the dynamic interaction exist longer at higher temperature due to the electron-phonon interaction effect.
Furthermore, the aim of this work was to look for the influences of the band gap and electron concentration on the dynamic damping. The measurements of temperature dependence showed that there were no direct influences of the different band gap size and electron concentration on dynamic damping. However, the magnitude of dynamic interactions has been proved to be in correlation with band gap type and electron mobility.
