Mixed quantum-classical simulation of the hydride transfer reaction catalyzed by dihydrofolate reductase based on a mapped system-harmonic bath model
The hydride transfer reaction catalyzed by dihydrofolate reductase is studied using a recently developed mixed quantum-classical method to investigate the nuclear quantum effects on the reaction. Molecular dynamics simulation is first performed based on a two-state empirical valence bond potential to map the atomistic model to an effective double-well potential coupled to a harmonic bath. In the mixed quantum-classical simulation, the hydride degree of freedom is quantized, and the effective harmonic oscillator modes are treated classically. It is shown that the hydride transfer reaction rate using the mapped effective double-well/harmonic-bath model is dominated by the contribution from the ground vibrational state. Further comparison with the adiabatic reaction rate constant based on the Kramers theory confirms that the reaction is primarily vibrationally adiabatic, which agrees well with the high transmission coefficients found in previous theoretical studies. The calculated kinetic isotope effect is also consistent with the experimental and recent theoretical results.
I. INTRODUCTION
Proton transfer (PT) reactions play an important role in many chemical and biological processes [1,2], ranging from fuel cells to enzymatic reactions. An important yet not well-resolved problem concerning PT reactions in various condensed phase environments is how the quantum effect of the proton degree of freedom affects the reaction dynamics [3–9]. Experimentally, the nuclear quantum effect can be inferred from the kinetic isotope effect (KIE), where a large KIE usually indicates strong quantum tunneling [2]. However, it has been recently realized that even if the KIE is not very large, quantum tunneling may also play an important role [6,7]. Many theoretical methods have been proposed to investigate quantum effects on PT reactions, for example, methods that include quantum tunneling corrections to the classical transition state theory (TST) [3,10,11], quantum transition state theories (QTSTs) [12–16], semiclassical and quasiclassical methods [17–23], and mixed quantum-classical simulations [24–29].
In simulations of PT reactions in condensed phases, one system that has drawn extensive attention is the hydride transfer reaction catalyzed by dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). DHFR is a ubiquitous enzyme indispensable for cellular metabolism in eukaryotes and prokaryotes [30], which catalyzes the reduction of 7,8-dihydrofolate (DHF) to 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate (THF) using the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) as a cofactor [31]. Among the many theoretical studies of the hydride transfer reaction catalyzed by DHFR, the nuclear quantum effects on the reaction dynamics are of particular interest [25,32–35]. For example, Hammes-Schiffer and co-workers studied the nuclear quantum effects and the role of enzyme dynamics in DHFR catalysis using the molecular dynamics with quantum transition (MDQT) method [25,33]. Garcia-Viloca et_al investigated the quantum effects using the ensemble-averaged variational transition state theory with multidimensional tunneling (EA-VTST/MT) approach [32]. Liu and Warshel have employed the quantum classical path centroid method to calculate the nuclear quantum effects and the KIE [36]. Boekelheide et_al used the ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) method to simulate the hydride transfer reaction and investigate the effect of protein vibrational motions [35].
Within the mixed quantum-classical picture of the PT reaction, we have recently developed a new method [37] for calculating the PT rate constants of a double-well model system coupled to a harmonic bath. In this method, the proton degree of freedom is quantized. The collective solvent polarization is taken as the reaction coordinate, and its dynamics is treated classically as over-damped diffusive motion. Although the method is still limited to model systems, it has the advantage that contributions to the total reaction rate from different vibrational states can be calculated separately. The new method is found to be accurate both in the deep-tunneling and over-the-barrier regimes by comparing with numerical exact results from the hierarchical equation of motion (HEOM) method [37]. By calculating the contributions to the total reaction rate constant from different vibrational states, it can also provide a useful tool in analyzing the PT reaction mechanism. Depending on the system parameters of the double-well/harmonic-bath model, the PT mechanisms ranging from deep-tunneling to intermediate and over-the-barrier regimes have been studied [37].
In this work, we apply the new method to simulate the hydride transfer reaction in DHFR to further understand the quantum effects on the reaction. To achieve this goal, we use the empirical valence bond (EVB) potential [38–40] as the underlying atomistic model and construct an effective harmonic bath model. We first calculate the free energy profile using the energy gap between the two diabatic EVB states as the reaction coordinate and identify the transition state. Subsequently, a two-dimensional free energy surface calculation is performed near the transition state to obtain the one-dimensional (1D) free energy curve for the hydride coordinate at the transition state. An effective double-well potential coupled to the harmonic bath model is then constructed by using the classical 1D free energy curve for the hydride at the transition state, the free energy difference between the reactant and product, the reaction free energy barrier, and the time scale of the electrostatic contribution to the energy gap fluctuation. Based on the effective harmonic bath model, mixed quantum-classical simulation is performed and the reaction mechanism is analyzed. We note that similar strategies have been used in previous studies of the Azzouzz-Borgis model [41,42], where the atomistic model is used to build an effective Hamiltonian, followed by further quantum dynamics simulations.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we introduce the model Hamiltonian and mixed quantum-classical rate theory used in this work, as well as the EVB potential based on which the effective double-well/harmonic-bath model is constructed. Details of the molecular dynamics simulations using the EVB potential, the mapped effective harmonic bath model, and the results of the mixed quantum-classical simulation are presented in Sec. III. Finally, conclusions and discussions are made in Sec. IV.
II. THEORY
A. Model Hamiltonian and the mixed quantum-classical reaction rate
The mixed quantum-classical method developed in a recent work [37] is used to calculate the quantum reaction dynamics. As in many previous studies [28,43,44], we consider a model system that consists of a double-well coupled to a harmonic oscillator bath. The total Hamiltonian is written as
where Ĥ_{S} represents the 1D system Hamiltonian for the hydride degree of freedom, Ĥ_{B} is the bath Hamiltonian representing the effects of the polar solvent environment which is modeled as a group of independent harmonic oscillators, Ĥ_{SB} is the system-bath coupling term, and Ĥ_{ren} is the renormalization term that compensates the shift of system potential due to the system-bath interaction. Their explicit forms are given by
and
where p^{s} and q^ are the momentum and coordinate of the transferring hydride; m_{s} and m_{j} are the masses of the hydride and bath degrees of freedom; x^{j}, p^{j}, and ω_{j} are the coordinate, momentum, and frequency of the jth bath mode; c_{j} is the coupling coefficient between the jth bath mode and the system coordinate operator q^.
The system-bath coupling is characterized by the spectral density J(ω) defined as
In this work, the Debye spectral density is used,
where ω_{c} is the cutoff frequency describing the timescale of the bath relaxation and η represents the system-bath coupling strength.
To simulate the hydride transfer reaction dynamics, the mixed quantum-classical method in a previous work [37] is employed. In this method, the hydride degree of freedom is quantized, and the classical collective bath coordinate X=∑_{j}c_{j}x_{j} in Eq. (4) is used as the reaction coordinate. Starting from the Onsager fluctuation regression theorem, the total reaction rate constant k is calculated as k=lim_{t→tp}k(t) [45,46], with
where ĥ is the projection operator of the product state, and δĥ = ĥ − 〈ĥ〉, t_{p} is a short time interval when the right-hand side of Eq. (8) reaches a plateau, and 〈⋯〉 indicates the average over the canonical ensemble. Since the collective solvent coordinate X=∑_{j}c_{j}x_{j} is used as the reaction coordinate, we use the following definition of the product projection operator:
where H is the Heaviside function, X^{*} defines the dividing surface between the reactant and product, using the collective solvent coordinate X as the reaction coordinate.
In Ref [37], the hydride degree of freedom is quantized, the bath degrees of freedom are treated classically, and the ⟨ĥ̇(0)δĥ(t)⟩ term in Eq. (8) is calculated as follows:
where L_{T}=ℏ^{−1}[Ĥ,ρ], x and p are the coordinates and momenta of the classical degrees of freedom, v_{j} = p_{j}/m_{j}, Tr_{h} indicates the trace over the hydride degree of freedom, Ĥ_{h}(X)=Ĥ_{S}+Ĥ_{ren}−Xq^,
where Z_{B}, Z^{*}, and Z denote the partition functions of the bath, the transition state, and the whole system, respectively.
In Eq. (10), when using the Debye spectral density in Eq. (7), ρ(X, t) is propagated using the mixed quantum-classical equation of motion [37],
where L_{s}ρ=ℏ^{−1}[Ĥ_{S}+Ĥ_{ren},ρ],q^,∂∂Xρ(X,t)=q^∂∂Xρ(X,t)+[∂∂Xρ(X,t)]q^. In the literature, similar equations of motion have been derived previously by considering a collective bath mode that couples to a white noise bath in the high temperature limit [47,48].
Details on preparing the initial state of ρ(X, 0) and the calculation of the Z_{B}Z^{*}Z term in Eq. (10) can be found in Ref [37], where it is shown that the above mixed quantum-classical method is capable to treat the reaction dynamics involving non-adiabatic transitions among multiple vibrational states in the high-temperature cases. In calculating the correlation function in Eq. (10), we have also used H(q^) to calculate the product population in replace of H(X), which simplifies the calculation, and it is found to give correct rate constants in previous studies using the spin-boson model [49].
B. Vibrationally adiabatic reaction rate
To find out whether the vibrationally non-adiabatic effects play a role in the hydride transfer reaction in DHFR, we will also compare the rate constant calculated from the mixed quantum-classical simulation to the classical vibrationally adiabatic reaction rate constant. In this case, the reaction dynamics can be described using the Smoluchowski equation [50],
where P(X, t) is the probability density of the collective coordinate X at time t, V_{ad}(X) is the adiabatic potential of mean force (PMF) on the ground vibrational state, and D = ηω_{c}k_{B}T is the diffusion constant. The specific form of the ground state PMF V_{ad}(X) for the effective double-well/harmonic-bath model will be given later in Sec. III C.
When the free energy barrier E_{b} is sufficiently high, the analytical expression for the forward rate constant is given by Kramers’ theory [50,51],
In the above equation, ω_{0} and ω_{b} are defined using the second-order derivative of the adiabatic PMF V_{ad}(X) at the reactant minimum X_{0}, ω02=∂^{2}V_{ad}(X)∂X^{2}|_{X=X0}, and at the barrier top X^{*}: ωb2=−∂^{2}V_{ad}(X)∂X^{2}|_{X=X^{*}}.
C. The EVB potential
In this work, we use the empirical valence bond (EVB) potential [38–40] as the underlying atomistic model to construct the effective double-well/harmonic-bath model in Eq. (1). The EVB potential is based on a force field description of the atomistic interactions but provides in an effective way the capability to describe bond breaking and formation in chemical reactions [38,52]. The two-state EVB potential used in this work to describe the hydride transfer reaction in DHFR is essentially the same as in several previous studies [25,34,35]. In this method, the two diabatic potential energy surfaces for the reactant state Ψ_{1} = DH⋯A^{+} and the product state Ψ_{2} = D^{+}⋯HA are represented by classical force fields,
where r describes the coordinates of the reactants or products (solute), and R represents the coordinates of the surrounding water and protein molecules (solvent). Uintrai(r) is the intramolecular potential of the solute (relative to its minimum ε_{i}) in the ith state; Uinteri(r,R) is the interaction between the solute and the surrounding solvent degrees of freedom in the ith state; and U_{solvent}(R) represents the potential energy of the solvent, which is assumed to be the same for both the reactant and product states.
The H_{11} and H_{22} terms form the diagonal matrix elements of a 2 × 2 Hamiltonian. We employ the constant off-diagonal coupling scheme that has been used in previous studies [25,35,53], by setting H_{12} = H_{21} = Δ. After diagonalizing the 2 × 2 Hamiltonian matrix, the ground state potential surface is obtained and used for the MD simulation. As in previous studies [25,34,35], the potentials H_{ii} are described using force fields, while the coupling constant Δ and the energy bias ε = ε_{2} − ε_{1} are adjusted to reproduce the free energy difference between the reactant and product, as well as the reaction barrier height. In this work, the EVB potential is not used directly for the mixed quantum-classical dynamics but is employed to construct an effective double-well/harmonic-bath model as described in Sec. II A. Details of the mapping procedure are given in Sec. III.
III. RESULTS
A. MD simulation
MD simulations using the two-state EVB potential are first performed. Initial positions of the heavy atoms of the enzyme and cofactors are obtained from the structures, Protein Data Bank (pdb) code 1RX2 [54]. The AMBER03 force field [55] is used, and the NADPH and DHF cofactors are modeled using the general AMBER force field (GAFF) [56]. The partial charges of the reactants and products are calculated using the Gaussian 09 package [57] and the restricted electrostatic potential (RESP) fitting procedure [58]. 17 839 water molecules and 15 sodium ions are added to the simulation box, and altogether 56 147 atoms are included in the simulation. Energy minimization of the whole system is first performed on the donor state, which is then slowly heated up to 298 K. NPT and NVT simulations are then performed to equilibrate the system. In the simulations, the non-bonded cutoff distance is taken as 10 Å, and the long range electrostatic interactions are treated using the particle mesh Ewald (PME) method [59]. The time step of MD simulation is 1 fs. All the calculations are done using the Amber11 package [60,61], and the DH–A^{+} state (donor state) is used in the MD simulations for equilibration.
Based on the equilibrated MD structure of the DH–A^{+} state, we first run the NVT simulation for 200 ps on the EVB potential energy surface. The potential of mean force (PMF) calculations are then performed using the EVB potential, by employing the energy gap between the diabatic donor and acceptor states, Δε(r, R) = H_{11}(r, R) − H_{22}(r, R), as the reaction coordinate. To calculate the free energy profile, we apply Warshel’s mapping potential approach [38,62], by changing the mapping coefficient λ from 0 to 1 with fixed increments of 0.05. All simulations using the EVB potential were performed with the AMBER11 package [60,61]. Calculations of free energy curves are performed using the method developed by Wong et_al in Refs [63] and  [64].
As in several previous studies [25,35,63], the coupling constant Δ and energy bias ε_{1} − ε_{2} are adjusted to reproduce the free energy difference of 4.4 kcal/mol for the reactant and product states and the reaction barrier of 15.8 kcal/mol, which is the free energy barrier for a model with classical hydride [25]. In this work, the coupling constant Δ is set to be 29.5 kcal/mol and the bias ε_{1} − ε_{2} is −210.4 kcal/mol. The calculated classical PMF is shown in Fig. 1, which agrees with previous theoretical studies using similar models [25,34,35]. The statistical errors of the free energy barrier and free energy difference between the reactant and product states are around 0.5 kcal/mol.
B. Mapping to the effective harmonic bath model
We then proceed to map the atomistic model described by the EVB potential to an effective double-well/harmonic-bath model as described in Sec. II A. To obtain parameters of the potential energy surface V_{s}(q) as a function of the hydride coordinate q, we explore in the next step the free energy surface for the hydride degree of freedom at the transition state defined by Δε = Δε^{*}. The coordinate for hydride transfer is defined as q = (r_{DH} − r_{AH})/2, where r_{DH} is the bond length between the donor atom and the transferring hydride and r_{AH} is the bond length between the acceptor atom and the transferring hydride.
Since we do not intend to obtain the full two-dimensional (2D) PMF for the collective coordinate Δε and hydride coordinate q, calculations are performed only near the transition state defined by Δε = Δε^{*}. The umbrella sampling method combined with the 2D weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) approach [65,66] is used to obtain the 2D PMF, and altogether 120 windows are used in the 2D PMF calculation. The 2D PMF near the transition state defined by Δε = Δε^{*} is plotted in Fig. 2(a), and the 1D cut along the hydride coordinate q at Δε = Δε^{*} is shown in Fig. 2(b). Δϵ^{*} obtained from the 1D PMF in Fig. 1 is about −0.4 kcal/mol, which is very close to 0 considering the energy scale in Fig. 1. It can be seen that the hydride transfer free energy curve is barrierless at the transition state, which indicates that the PT reaction might be vibrationally adiabatic, i.e., the hydride transfer reaction may occur on the ground vibrational state after the hydride degree of freedom is quantized.
In the double-well/harmonic-bath model described in Sec II A, the free energy curve for the hydride transfer at the transition state is determined by both the bare potential V_{s}(q) and the bath parameters η and ω_{c}. The bare potential energy surface V_{s}(q) for the hydride coordinate is assumed to be
The relaxation time ωc−1 of the bath degrees of freedom can be inferred from the auto-correlation function of the energy gap fluctuations. Previous studies have shown that [36,40,67] in proton transfer reactions with a significant change of polarity, the electrostatic interactions with the protein environment and solvent play a major role in determining both the energetics and dynamics of the reaction. As we are interested in the relaxation time scales of the protein environment and solvent, the auto-correlation function of the electrostatic contribution to the energy gap fluctuations [67] is calculated and the normalized correlation function is shown in Fig. 3. The correlation function has multiple scales as in many biological systems, and the two fastest time scales fitted from Fig. 3 are 15 fs and 130 fs with amplitudes of 0.4 and 0.3, respectively. As the mixed quantum-classical model presented in Sec. II assumes that there is a single time scale for the collective solvent coordinate X, we thus chose an intermediate time scale with ω_{c} = 100 cm^{−1}, which corresponds to a bath correlation time of 53 fs. This choice is also consistent with the study in Ref [34], where it is found that effective harmonic modes with frequency smaller than 200 cm^{−1} contribute significantly to the total reorganization energy.
To fit the remaining parameters a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{4}, and η in the double-well/harmonic-bath model, we perform calculations of both the classical and mixed quantum-classical free energy profiles of the model Hamiltonian in Eq. (1). We require the parameters in the double-well/harmonic-bath model to satisfy the following conditions: (1) For the classical free energy profile (i.e., when both the hydride and harmonic bath degrees of freedom are treated classically), the 1D free energy curve as a function of the hydride coordinate q at X = 0 (which lies very close to the transition state X = X^{*}) reproduces the minimum position and the second order derivative at the minimum position in the 1D free energy curve as shown in Fig. 2(b). (2) The mixed quantum-classical free energy curve (i.e., when the hydride is quantized and the bath degrees of freedom are treated classically) as a function of the collective bath coordinate X reproduces the experimental free energy difference of 4.4 kcal/mol for the reactant and product and the reaction barrier of 13.4 kcal/mol [25,68]. The four parameters a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{4}, and η are then adjusted to satisfy the above requirements. The final parameters used in the simulation are (all in atomic units) a_{1} = −0.0038, a_{2} = 0.0585, a_{4} = 0.031, and η = 0.431. We note that the above parameters might not be unique because of the nonlinear nature of the fitting procedure.
The bare potential energy surface V_{s}(q) for the hydride coordinate is shown in Fig. 4, and the corresponding classical 2D PMF is shown in Fig. 5. The 1D free energy curve at the transition state X = X^{*} is plotted in Fig. 6 and compared with the data in Fig. 2(a). It can be seen that the effective harmonic bath model reproduces the free energy curve as a function of q at the transition state reasonably well. Further comparison between Fig. 6 and Fig. 4 indicates that due to the large reorganization term in Eq. (5), the 1D free energy curve for the hydride coordinate q becomes barrierless at the transition state defined by the collective coordinate X [since the transition state is very close to X = 0, the system-bath coupling term in Eq. (4) does not affect the 1D free energy curve in Fig. 6 significantly].
Because the double-well/harmonic-bath model in Eq. (1) is a simplified approximation to the atomistic model based on the EVB potential, we do not intend to reproduce more details of the atomistic model. In Subsection III C, we will focus on using the effective model to investigate the quantum effects of the hydride transfer reaction within the mixed quantum-classical picture as presented in Sec. II A.
C. Mixed quantum-classical free energy, rate dynamics, and the kinetic isotope effect
With the above obtained parameters for the effective double-well/harmonic-bath model, we are now able to apply the mixed quantum-classical method presented in Sec. II A to investigate the reaction dynamics. In the double-well/harmonic-bath model in Eq. (1), after the hydride degree of freedom is quantized, the PMF for the n-th vibrational state is given by [37]
where Λ=∑_{j}2cj2m_{j}ωj2 and E_{n}(X) is the n-th eigenvalue of the operator Ĥ_{S}+Ĥ_{ren}−Xq^. The total PMF can be calculated by a summation of contributions from all vibrational states.
The calculated total mixed quantum-classical free energy curve and that of the first excited vibrational state for the hydride transfer reaction are shown in Fig. 7. Since the excited vibrational states are much higher than the ground state, the ground state free energy curve is indistinguishable from the total one (solid black curve in Fig. 7) and is not plotted separately. As shown in Eq. (18), contributions from the renormalization term are the same for the ground and excited state surfaces; the free energy difference between the ground and first excited vibrational states is thus affected by the system-bath coupling term in Eq. (4) and varies as a function of the collective coordinate X. The energy differences at the reactant and product positions are around 4000 cm^{−1}, which are larger than the usual vibrational frequency of proton stretching vibrational motion. The large energy difference of 2800 cm^{−1} at the transition state is also found to be comparable to the energy gap (3000 cm^{−1}) between the ground and first excited vibrational states calculated from the 1D PMF curve shown in Fig. 2(b). The free energy gap of 2800 cm^{−1} at the transition state is much larger than k_{B}T, so it is expected that the mixed quantum-classical reaction dynamics might be vibrationally adiabatic. Moreover, since the free energy gap depends on both the bare double-well potential and the renormalization potential, it is very different from the coupling constant Δ (29.5 kcal/mol, or 10 300 cm^{−1}) in the two-state EVB model.
The total PMF for the deuterium negative ion transfer is also plotted in Fig. 7. It can be seen that when changing from hydride to the deuterium negative ion, the barrier height increases slightly by 1.0 × 10^{−3} a.u. (0.628 kcal/mol). We note that the free energy difference is calculated from the double-well/harmonic-bath model, and thus it is not affected by the statistical error in the EVB calculations.
The time-dependent rate coefficient in Eq. (8) is then calculated for the hydride transfer reaction. To compare with the analytical rate constant given by Eq. (15), we define a time-dependent prefactor A(t) using Eq. (8) as k_{f}(t)=A(t)e^{−βEb}, where E_{b} is the free energy barrier determined from the mixed quantum-classical free energy curve in Fig. 7 and k_{f}(t) = 〈ĥ〉k(t) (where 〈ĥ〉 denotes the equilibrium product population) is the forward rate constant defined using k(t) in Eq. (8).
The time-dependent prefactor A(t) in Fig. 8(a) show persisted oscillations, while a rate constant can be extracted from the decay of populations [44], which is equivalent to average over a few oscillation cycles. The calculated rate constant is 260 s^{−1}, which is of the same order as the experimental rate constant at 950 s^{−1} [68]. The contribution to the total A(t) from excited vibrational states is shown separately in Fig. 8(b). It can be seen that contribution from the ground vibrational state dominates the prefactor A(t), while that from the excited vibrational states is smaller by more than 5 orders of magnitude. This is in contrast to all the cases studied in Ref [37], where vibrational non-adiabaticity plays an important role in both the deep-tunneling and over-the-barrier regimes.
We also compare A(t) with the prefactor ηω_{c}ω_{0}ω_{b}2π calculated using the analytical expression in Eq. (15) for the vibrationally adiabatic reaction, using V_{ad}(X) = W_{0}(X), i.e., the free energy profile for the ground vibrational state (the black solid curve in Fig. 7). The calculated prefactor is shown as a dashed line in Fig. 8. It can be seen that the mixed quantum-classical prefactor A(t) is very close to the vibrationally adiabatic one, which further confirms that the reaction is primarily occurring on the ground vibrational state.
The calculated time-dependent prefactors for the deuterium negative ion transfer is shown in Fig. 9 and compared with those of the hydride transfer in Fig. 8(a). It can be seen that the prefactors are very similar such that the KIE is mainly due to the difference between free energy barriers as illustrated in Fig. 7. Again, this is related to the vibrational adiabaticity of the reaction since the transmission coefficient for deuterium negative ion transfer will be very different if the reaction is vibrationally non-adiabatic [37]. By combining the prefactor and free energy barrier changes, the KIE calculated from the effective double-well/harmonic-bath model is 2.8, which is close to the experiment (3.0 ± 0.4) [68] and previous theoretical studies [25,32,35,36].
IV. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSIONS
In summary, we have applied the recently developed mixed quantum-classical method [37] to investigate the hydride transfer reaction catalyzed by DHFR. Classical MD simulations based on the EVB potential are first performed. The atomistic model is then mapped onto an effective double-well/harmonic-bath model, and finally, mixed quantum-classical simulations are performed to investigate the hydride transfer reaction dynamics. Further analysis of the mixed quantum-classical rate dynamics shows that the hydride transfer reaction is essentially vibrationally adiabatic, i.e., it occurs on the ground vibrational state. The vibrational adiabaticity of the hydride transfer reaction may also be inferred from the free energy gap at the transition state defined using the collective bath coordinate, by comparing it with the thermal energy k_{B}T.
The current study also involves other approximations besides those used in mapping the atomistic model with the EVB potential to the effective harmonic bath model. For example, effects of the hydride donor-acceptor vibrational motion [33,35,69–71] are not considered explicitly in the current study, and only a single relaxation time scale is used for the bath degree of freedom. In principle, we may adopt more complex models to include the donor-acceptor vibrational mode [72] or to use more complex spectral densities in the simulation [73]. But we expect that including these effects is not likely to change the main conclusion that the hydride transfer reaction based on the two-state EVB potential is mainly vibrationally adiabatic due to the following reasons: (1) Although fluctuations of the hydride donor-acceptor distance can enhance the hydride transfer reaction by sampling configurations with smaller donor-acceptor distance and shorter hydride transfer distance, reducing the donor-acceptor distance will not change the vibrational adiabaticity of the reaction since the hydride transfer at the transition state is already barrierless as shown in Fig. 2. (2) The free energy gap between the ground and excited vibrational states shown in Fig. 7 is quite large when comparing to the time scales shown in Fig. 3, so using other values between the two extracted time scales for ω_{c} or including multiple time scales for the bath motion will also not make fundamental differences.
The above findings on the vibrationally adiabatic hydride transfer reaction indicate that the nuclear quantum effect and the KIE are mostly due to the modification of the transition state population in the mixed quantum-classical picture, rather than the vibrationally non-adiabatic transmission coefficient. This also agrees with the previous mixed quantum classical studies using the MDQT simulations, where high transmission coefficients (0.8 for hydride transfer and 0.85 for deuterium negative ion transfer) are obtained when comparing to the TST theory [25]. Similar high transmission coefficients are also obtained in the literature using the EA-VTST/MT approach [32] and the RPMD method [35] although the underlying theories of these studies are not based on the mixed quantum-classical picture of the hydride transfer reaction.
In principle, the mixed quantum-classical reaction dynamics may also become vibrationally non-adiabatic in other proton transfer or hydride transfer reactions, where the quantum effects on the transmission coefficient become important. This is more likely to happen in reactions with large KIEs [74,75]. The methods presented in the current work would also be useful to study reactions in these systems. Another possible extension of the current work in calculating the rate dynamics is to extend the mixed quantum-classical equation of motion to arbitrary temperature and spectral densities, in which previous results on the relation between the collective coordinate and momentum operators and the ADOs in the HEOM [76,77] might be useful.
Finally, we note that the empirical two-state EVB potential used in this study and some previous studies might not be as accurate as the quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods in describing the potential energy surface for the hydride transfer. In future studies, more accurate methods such as the multiple-state EVB model [78,79] and the hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) approach [80,81] may be employed to provide a more accurate description of the atomistic model for the proton and hydride transfer reactions.
