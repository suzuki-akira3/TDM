The Markov process admits a consistent steady-state thermodynamic formalism
The search for a unified formulation for describing various non-equilibrium processes is a central task of modern non-equilibrium thermodynamics. In this paper, a novel steady-state thermodynamic formalism was established for general Markov processes described by the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation. Furthermore, corresponding formalisms of steady-state thermodynamics for the master equation and Fokker-Planck equation could be rigorously derived in mathematics. To be concrete, we proved that (1) in the limit of continuous time, the steady-state thermodynamic formalism for the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation fully agrees with that for the master equation; (2) a similar one-to-one correspondence could be established rigorously between the master equation and Fokker-Planck equation in the limit of large system size; (3) when a Markov process is restrained to one-step jump, the steady-state thermodynamic formalism for the Fokker-Planck equation with discrete state variables also goes to that for master equations, as the discretization step gets smaller and smaller. Our analysis indicated that general Markov processes admit a unified and self-consistent non-equilibrium steady-state thermodynamic formalism, regardless of underlying detailed models.
I. INTRODUCTION
How to extend the concepts and methodology of equilibrium thermodynamics to general non-equilibrium cases is a big question [1,2]. In 1872, Boltzmann introduced the H-theorem to characterize the irreversibility of non-equilibrium processes in view of statistical mechanics [3]. Later, in 1931, Onsager published his celebrated reciprocal relation [4,5], which laid the foundation of modern non-equilibrium thermodynamics. After that, based on the local equilibrium hypothesis, Prigogine, de Groot, and Mazur et_al developed the classical irreversible thermodynamics [1], which has been extensively applied in the classical hydrodynamic regime. However, until now there is no widely accepted unified theory for describing various non-equilibrium processes.
An important forward step was done by Oono and Paniconi in 1998 [6]. By introducing several new concepts as “excess heat” and “housekeeping dissipation” for characterizing the energy exchange between a given system and its surroundings, they proposed a phenomenological framework to extend the equilibrium thermodynamics to the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS). The NESS is a direct generalization of the thermodynamic equilibrium state, both of which are time irrelevant. However, the NESS allows mass and energy transfer within a system or between systems, just provided the system is still in a dynamical balance. The NESS is usually correlated with key words like open system, heat and mass exchange, circular flows, break down of detailed balance, net entropy production rate, etc [7].
Employing the basic framework of Oono and Paniconi, Sasa and Tasaki [8] subsequently attempted to search for a unified thermodynamic formalism, which is expected to apply to a large class of non-equilibrium steady states including a heat conducting fluid, a sheared fluid, and an electrically conducting fluid. Later, the formalism of steady-state thermodynamics has been developed into great details in several concrete classical examples. As an example, for the Langevin dynamics, Sekimoto [9,10], Hatano and Sasa [11] found that the extended form of the second law holds for transitions between steady states and the Shannon entropy difference is related to the excess heat produced in an infinitely slow operation. As to the master equation and Fokker-Planck equation, Esposito and Van den Broeck [12,13] showed that with respect to the steady state, the entropy production rate could be decomposed into a sum of two non-negative terms, namely, the adiabatic and non-adiabatic parts, which reflect the irreversibility of the system under equilibrium and steady states, respectively. Based on their formulation, the second law of thermodynamics could be casted into three different strengthened versions. Alternative strengthened versions of second law of thermodynamics have been reported by Hong et_al for the master equation too [14] and then been proved valid for general irreversible processes as an inference of famous KL divergence [15]. Recently, by using the large-deviation theory, Ge and Qian [16] proved that a nonlinear chemical reaction system has a consistent steady state thermodynamic formalism in both macroscopic and mesoscopic scales, including the free energy, entropy production rate, and its decomposition.
Although it appears that many classical physical systems could be casted into a unified framework of steady-state thermodynamics proposed by Oono and Paniconi [6], it is still questionable how closely are those formalisms related to each other. Especially given the deep mathematical and physical correlations among several well-known models, e.g., according to Itô calculus, the Fokker-Planck equation governs the probability distribution evolution of a corresponding Langevin dynamics in time, it would be natural to expect that the constructed steady-state thermodynamic formalisms on those models will preserve such a kind of correspondence. Only in this way, we could expect the existence, uniqueness, consistency, and operability of a unified steady-state thermodynamics for general non-equilibrium processes, rather than studies case by case.
Motivated by recent developments in the steady-state thermodynamics, particularly the studies of Esposito and Van den Broeck on the master equation and Fokker-Planck equation [12,13], we are trying to show there is indeed a consistent framework of steady-state thermodynamic descriptions, at least for various Markov processes in the discrete or continuous space. To be concrete, the steady-state thermodynamic formalism here we mean not only includes those classical thermodynamic elements like the internal energy, Helmholtz free energy, Boltzmann entropy, entropy flow and entropy production rate but also contains the excess heat, decomposition of entropy production rate into adiabatic and non-adiabatic parts, as well as three different strengthened versions of the second law of thermodynamics as defined in Eqs. (4)–(13) for the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation.
More importantly, with respect to these quantities and relations for steady-state thermodynamics, a one-to-one correspondence during the coarse graining procedure from the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation to the master equation and then to the Fokker-Planck equation could be rigorously established in mathematics. We show that (1) in the limit of continuous time, the steady-state thermodynamic formalism for the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation fully agrees with that for the master equation; (2) a similar one-to-one correspondence could be established rigorously between the master equation and Fokker-Planck equation in the limit of large system size; (3) when a Markov process is restrained to one-step jump, the steady-state thermodynamic formalism for the Fokker-Planck equation with discrete state variables also goes to the formulation for master equations, as the discretization step gets smaller and smaller. By studying these concrete models of Markov processes, the consistency of steady-state thermodynamics could thus be verified.
II. STEADY-STATE THERMODYNAMIC FORMALISM FOR C-K EQUATIONS
As the most important stochastic process, the Markov process has been extensively applied to laser physics, chemical reactions, molecular biology, and many other fields [17]. The Markov property indicates that the future probabilities of a Markov process could be solely determined by the present state, hence independent of its whole history. Mathematically, a Markov process is characterized by the well-known Chapman-Kolmogorov equation (or C-K equation for short),
where P(x, t + Δt|x_{0}, t_{0}) is the transition probability density at position x and time t + Δt given the initial position x_{0} at time t_{0}. In what follows, the dependence of variables on initial conditions will be dropped for notational simplicity, i.e., P(x, t) ≡ P(x, t|x_{0}, t_{0}). Note that the integral above can be directly replaced by a summation in the discrete case, without affecting all following results.
After a sufficiently long time, a Markov process would be expected to reach a steady state characterized by a time-independent probability density function
Substituting it into Eq. (1), one has
for every x and every t, Δt > 0. In the last equality, the normalization property ∫dyP(y, t + Δt|x, t) = 1 is used. If there is P^{e}(x) > 0, it further satisfies
Equation (1) will be called under the condition of detailed balance, which apparently is a special case of the steady state condition.
To construct the steady-state thermodynamics for the C-K equation, we define the entropy function S^{C}(t) as
where the Boltzmann constant k_{B} is set to be 1. With the entropy function in hand, it is straightforward to calculate the entropy difference between two successive time,
where ΔS^{C}(t) = −∫dx[P(x, t + Δt) − P(x, t)]ln P(x, t) denotes the usual entropy change, and ΔI^{C}(t)=−∫dxP(x,t+Δt)lnP(x,t+Δt)P(x,t)≤0 denotes the information gain per Δt by virtue of the prior probability P(x, t). The equality holds if and only if (iff) at the steady state.
The following proposition gives an explicit expression of the entropy change for the Markov process described by the C-K equation.
Proposition 2.1. For the C-K equation (1), the entropy change per Δt is given by
where J^{C}(x, y, t, Δt) = P(x, t + Δt|y, t)P(y, t) − P(y, t + Δt|x, t)P(x, t) is the thermodynamic flux of the C-K equation.
Proof. By substituting the C-K equation (1) into the entropy change ΔS^{C}(t), one obtains
where the symmetry of integrals with respect to dummy variables x and y is used in the last equality.This gives the desired result.Based on the general framework for the steady-state thermodynamics proposed by Oono and Paniconi [6], the entropy change ΔS^{C}(t) could be separated into two parts: the entropy production ΔSiC(t) and entropy flow ΔSeC(t). The entropy production is always non-negative as a manifestation of the second law of thermodynamics. More interestingly, it can be further decomposed into a sum of two non-negative parts: the adiabatic and non-adiabatic entropy productions according to their different origins, which are stated through the following proposition.
Proposition 2.2. The entropy productionΔSiC(t)and entropy flowΔSeC(t)per Δt for the C-K equation are given as
Furthermore, the entropy productionΔSiC(t)can be decomposed into an adiabatic and a non-adiabatic parts as
Here P^{s}(x) denotes the probability density in the steady state. The entropy productionΔSiC(t)and its adiabatic partΔSadC(t)become zero if and only if (iff) the detailed balance condition holds, while the non-adiabatic partΔSnaC(t)is zero iff the probability reaches its steady state P^{s}(x).
Proof. It is sufficient to prove the non-negativity of ΔSadC(t) for t, Δt > 0, and ΔSnaC(t)≥0 could be obtained in a similar way. By rewriting the adiabatic entropy production in a compact form and using the inequality −ln ξ ≥ 1 − ξ for ξ > 0, we have
where the steady state condition (2) is used in the fourth step.
Remark 2.3. The non-negativity of the entropy productionΔSiC(t)is guaranteed by the second law of thermodynamics. It becomes zero if and only if the condition of detailed balance Eq. (3) holds.ΔSeC(t)represents the entropy exchange between the system and its surrounding environment and does not have a definite sign. The adiabatic entropy production, also known as the housekeeping heat, becomes zero if and only if the condition of detailed balance holds; while the non-adiabatic part vanishes as long as the steady state is attained.Further we introduce the excess entropy change as
then following results are derived as a direct corollary of above propositions.
Corollary 2.4. For any t, Δt > 0, the C-K equation has following relations:
(11) and (13) become equalities iff the detailed balance condition holds, while (12) becomes an equality iff at the steady state.The above corollary presents three different versions of the second law of thermodynamics for general Markov processes. Especially, the latter two go beyond the classical one and indicate that the second law of thermodynamics could be strengthened for certain systems.Till now, we have completed the construction of steady-state thermodynamic formalism for the C-K equation. As we will show later, above results, especially the strengthened versions of second law of thermodynamics, exactly correspond to those for the master equation [12] and the Fokker-Planck equation [13] in the thermodynamic limit, which constitutes the major conclusion of our current paper. Therefore, the steady-state thermodynamics is a self-consistent theory at least for various non-equilibrium systems governed by the Markov process and has more fruitful results than classical equilibrium thermodynamics.
III. FROM C-K EQUATION TO MASTER EQUATION
The Chapman-Kolmogorov equation is a manifestation of total probability theorem in the discrete time case. If the time interval becomes smaller and smaller, the C-K equation will go to the master equation in the limit of continuous time. To see this, we restrict ourselves to the stationary (or time-homogeneous) Markov process, that is, the conditional probability density P(x, t + Δt|y, t) is assumed to be independent of t. When Δt → 0, using the Taylor series expansion, one has
where W(x|y) ≥ 0 denotes the transition probability per unit time from state y to state x.
Substituting formula (14) to the C-K equation [Eq. (1)], we arrive at
Taking the limit Δt → 0 leads to the master equation, which describes how the probability of a system in state x at time t evolves with time, i.e.,
The master equation is an ordinary differential equation when the state space is discrete and becomes an integral-differential equation in the case of continuous states. It has been widely used in various stochastic processes, including random walks, birth-death processes, general chemical reaction systems [18,19], thermal unimolecular reactions at low pressures [20], single-molecule enzyme kinetics in open biochemical systems [21], etc.
By utilizing formula (14), the steady state of the C-K equation in Eq. (2) for all x ≠ y becomes
thus,
since the above equation holds automatically when x = y. Clearly, Eq. (16) agrees with the usual definition of steady-state solution P^{s}(x) for the master equation. Similarly, the condition of detailed balance of the C-K equation becomes
which is consistent with that for the master equation too.
Now we want to explore whether the steady-state thermodynamic formalism defined for the C-K equation [Eqs. (4)–(13)] is also valid for the master equation. As the entropy function used for the master equation
remains the same as that for the C-K equation, we can directly make use of Eq. (14) and obtain the following lemma.
Lemma 3.1. In the limit of continuous time, with respect to the transition rates defined in (14), the information gain for the stationary Markov process described by the C-K equation in (1) vanishes, and the entropy change rate approaches to the entropy difference per unit time, i.e.,
Proof. Notice that
then
This shows that the entropy change rate equals to the entropy difference per unit time in the limit of Δt → 0.Based on Proposition 2.2 and Lemma 3.1, we have following results.
Theorem 3.2. In the limit of continuous time, with respect to the transition rates defined in (14), the entropy production rate, entropy flow rate, adiabatic entropy production rate, non-adiabatic entropy production rate, and excess entropy change rate for the C-K equation (1) become
which emerge as the entropy production rate, entropy flow rate, adiabatic entropy production rate, non-adiabatic entropy production rate, and excess entropy change rate for the master equation (15), respectively. The thermodynamic flux is defined as J^{M}(x, y, t) = W(x|y)P(y, t) − W(y|x)P(x, t). HeredSiMdtanddSadMdtbecome zero iff the detailed balance condition holds, whiledSnaMdtis zero iff the probability reaches its steady state P^{s}(x).For the master equation (15), the adiabatic entropy production rate dSadMdt is also known as the house-keeping heat. And the non-adiabatic part dSnaMdt is related to the free energy dissipation rate, which vanishes when the relaxation to the steady state is extremely fast [12]. Note that in the limit of continuous time, the steady-state thermodynamic formalism defined for the C-K equation fully agrees with the formulation for the discrete master equation [12,13]. Thus the correspondence between the C-K equation and the master equation on the steady-state thermodynamics is completely verified.
IV. FROM MASTER EQUATION TO F-P EQUATION
The master equation involves transitions among all possible states, which are hard to be modeled or computed. Practically, a coarser description of the system in replace of the master equation is needed, which is now known as the Fokker-Planck equation (F-P equation for short). The F-P equation has been applied to fields as diverse as quantum optics [22], micro-macro coupling models of polymeric fluids [23], biochemical oscillations [24], electric circuits and laser arrays, population dynamics and stock marketing [25], etc.
It is well known that the F-P equation can be deduced from the master equation by expanding the transition rates and neglecting high order terms of jump moments. In order to make the derivation strictly in mathematics, we adopt the canonical form expansion introduced by Van Kampen [26], in which a parameter Ω representing the system size is introduced. Then the master equation (15) can be rewritten as
Without loss of generality, we set V_{x} = {y:∥ y − x ∥ ≤ Ω} as a region with centre x and radius Ω, the dependence of probability P_{Ω} and transition rate W_{Ω} on Ω is written out explicitly. By defining a jump length r = x − y, one can rewrite W_{Ω}(x|y) ≡ W_{Ω}(y, r) = W_{Ω}(x − r, r).
With respect to the system size Ω, we introduce the re-scaled state variable, time, and jump distance, respectively, as
Consequently, we have dx = ΩdX, ∂_{t} = Ω^{−1}∂_{T}, and dy = −ΩdR. Since W_{Ω}(x − r, r) and P_{Ω}(x, t) can be expanded into power series of Ω^{−1}, i.e.,
the master equation (24) is reformulated as
Here V_{0} = {R:∥ R ∥ ≤ 1} denotes a region with centre 0 and radius 1. Taking Taylor series expansion of Φ_{i}(X − R, R) and p_{i}(X − R, T) with respect to X, we have
where terms ∫_{V0}dR[Φ_{i}(X,R)−Φ_{i}(X,−R)] (i ≥ 0) are exactly cancelled due to the symmetry of integral region V_{0}.
To make a coarse graining of the system, following jump moments are introduced:
Especially, here we are interested in master equations of the diffusion-type [26], which require α_{1,0}(X) = 0. By substituting the jump moments into Eq. (27) and taking the limit Ω → ∞, the zeroth order equation in Ω yields the casual Fokker-Planck equation
where J^{F}(X, T) is the probability flux. α_{1,1}(X) and α_{2,0}(X) (α_{2,0}(X) > 0) denote the drift and diffusion coefficients, respectively. Note that both coefficients α_{1,1}(X) and α_{2,0}(X) are functions of position X.
Similarly, the steady state of the master equation (24) becomes
which gives
This is exactly the definition of the steady state for the F-P equation. Thus we have justified the consistency of the steady state between the master equation and the F-P equation. A subclass of steady state is the detailed balance p0e(X), which satisfies
Starting from the entropy function for the master equation S^{M}(t) = −∫dxP_{Ω}(x, t)ln P_{Ω}(x, t), it is straightforward to verify that the volume density of entropy S^{M},
emerges as the entropy function for the F-P equation in (29). This is not a coincidence. Actually, we can further show that the steady-state thermodynamic formalism defined on the master equation converges automatically to that on the F-P equation in the limit of large system size Ω → ∞. This interesting correspondence confirms that there indeed exists a consistent thermodynamic framework valid for general non-equilibrium phenomena described by Markov processes with respect to the steady state. Although a similar conclusion has been reached in Esposito and Van den Broeck’s original paper [13], their results are limited to a Markov chain process with only one-step jump and cannot be generalized to cases with multiple-step jump in principle. In contrast, our proof and conclusions do not suffer from such a limitation and are more rigorous in mathematics.
Theorem 4.1. In the limit of large system size Ω → ∞, the volume density of entropy production rate, entropy flow rate, adiabatic entropy production rate, non-adiabatic entropy production rate, and excess entropy change rate for the master equation (24) becomes
which emerge as the entropy production rate, entropy flow rate, adiabatic entropy production rate, non-adiabatic entropy production rate, and excess entropy change rate for the Fokker-Planck equation (29), respectively. HeredSiFdTanddSadFdTbecome zero iff the detailed balance condition holds, whiledSnaFdTis zero iff at the steady state.
Proof. Here we take the instantaneous entropy production rate as an example. Other relations could be deduced in a similar way, please see the Appendix for details. We rewrite the instantaneous entropy production rate for the master equation (24) as
where J^{M}(x, y, t) = W_{Ω}(x|y)P_{Ω}(y, t) − W_{Ω}(y|x)P_{Ω}(x, t) and A1M(x,y,t)=ln[W_{Ω}(x|y)P_{Ω}(y,t)]−ln[W_{Ω}(y|x)P_{Ω}(x,t)] represent the thermodynamic flux and force for the master equation (24), respectively. Expand J^{M} into Taylor series with respect to X as
where p_{i} is short for p_{i}(X, T). Similarly,
With respect to above formulas, the thermodynamic force A1M can be expanded as
Note that I_{11} ∼ O(Ω^{−1}) and I_{12} ∼ O(1). Accordingly, the volume density of entropy production rate for the master equation becomes
Since I_{12}(X, R) ≥ 0, according to the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,
with
and
As a result, the lower bound of the volume density of instantaneous entropy production rate for the master equation is given by
The dominant term on the right-hand side is exactly the instantaneous entropy production rate for the F-P equation. Actually, the above inequality provides an interesting relation between the entropy production rate for the master equation and that for the F-P equation. The latter exists as a lower bound for the former, which agrees with the information loss during the coarse graining procedure.In the limit of large system size Ω → ∞, the transition rates Φ_{i}(X, R) approach to delta functions with respect to the jump length R (since R = r/Ω → 0). Then the equality in (38) holds, meaning
This completes our proof.
Remark 4.2. From Theorems 3.2 and 4.1, it is notable that the instantaneous entropy-production rate, entropy flow rate, adiabatic entropy production rate, non-adiabatic entropy production rate, and excess entropy change rate for Markov processes could all be expressed as a bilinear form of thermodynamic fluxes and forces, a reflection of the famous Onsager-Casimir relation. [^{4}]It is noted that, as a direct application of the fundamental thermodynamic relation, the results for entropy discussed in Secs. II–IV could be generalized in parallel to the internal energy and the Helmholtz free energy too. The difference between the equilibrium and the steady-state thermodynamics has been investigated, for instance, in Ref [27].
V. FROM F-P EQUATION TO MASTER EQUATION
In Sec. IV, we deduce the steady-state thermodynamic structure for the F-P equation from that of the master equation. Astonishingly, an inverse procedure is also valid in mathematics. To be concrete, we can derive the steady-state thermodynamic formalism for a special type of master equations with a tridiagonal transition rate matrix from that of the corresponding F-P equation. This is the best result one can expect since only the first two jump moments are kept in the F-P equation.
We start with the F-P equation in (29) and discretize its right-hand side with respect to space variable X = nϵ,
for p(n, T) ≡ p_{0}(nϵ, T), α_{1,1}(n) ≡ α_{1,1}(nϵ), and α_{2,0}(n) ≡ α_{2,0}(nϵ). Clearly, the small parameter ϵ corresponds to 1/Ω in the canonical form expansion. The above equation can be rewritten into a master equation
with the forward and backward transition rates
Then based on the steady-state thermodynamic formalism for the F-P equation, following results can be verified.
Theorem 5.1. In the limit of ϵ → 0, the entropy production rate, entropy flow rate, adiabatic entropy production rate, non-adiabatic entropy production rate, and excess entropy change rate for the Fokker-Planck equation (29) with discrete state variables become
which lead to corresponding results for the master equation (39), respectively. Here J^{M}(m, n, T) = W(n|m)p(m, T) − W(m|n)p(n, T) and m = n ± 1. dSiMdTanddSadMdTbecome zero iff the detailed balance condition holds, whiledSnaMdTis zero iff the probability reaches its steady state P^{s}(x).
Proof. We take the entropy production rate dSiF(ϵ)/dT as an example. According to Eq. (33), the entropy production rate for the F-P equation is given by
Discretize above formula with respect to state variable X = nϵ and denote it as
where
Note that the leading terms of D_{1}(n, T) and D_{2}(n, T) are both O(1). As a result,
This completes the proof. Other relations could be verified in the same way and will not be shown here.
Remark 5.2. Based on Theorems 4.1 and 5.1, we can conclude that, in the limit of large system size, when a Markov process is restricted to one-step jump, the steady-state thermodynamic formalisms for the master equation and for the F-P equation have a one-to-one correspondence.Based on our proof, the discretization algorithm presented here is an entropy preserving scheme. This is an important and timely subject in numerical calculations that can preserve a certain kind of structure of continuous equations, like the symplectic geometry method [28] and the finite volume method [29]. The entropy stability of discrete schemes plays an important role in both the theory and computation of continuous systems [30]. And our studies in this section may shed light on this point.
VI. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSIONS
In this paper, we have explored the steady-state thermodynamics for Markov processes described by the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation, master equation, and Fokker-Planck equation separately. By taking the limit of continuous time, the steady-state thermodynamic formalism specified in Eqs. (4)–(13) for the C-K equation fully agrees with that for the master equation. A similar one-to-one correspondence could be established rigorously between the master equation and F-P equation in the limit of large system size by the canonical form expansion. Furthermore, when a Markov process is restrained to one-step jump, the steady-state thermodynamic formalism for the F-P equation with discrete state variables also goes to the formulation for a special type of master equations with a tridiagonal transition rate matrix, as the discretization step gets smaller and smaller. These interesting connections show that the steady-state thermodynamics thus constructed on a Markov process is totally consistent, no matter whether it is written in the form of C-K equation, master equation, or F-P equation.
In general, a mesoscopic time evolution equation has always two contributions: a mechanical part and a thermodynamic part [31]. The mechanical part is generally correlated with the conservation laws, which is time reversible and thus leaves the entropy unchanged, such as the Hamiltonian equations in classical mechanics and the Schrödinger equation in quantum mechanics. Contrarily, the thermodynamic part is of the Onsager type, which is time irreversible and keeps the entropy increasing in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics. In mathematics, a key difference between the mechanical and thermodynamic parts lies in their functional operators: one is anti-symmetric and the other is symmetric and semi-positive definite.
In order to combine both parts together, Grmela proposed early Hamiltonian versions of non-equilibrium thermodynamics [32], which were later developed into the so-called GENERIC form by Grmela and Öttinger [33,34]. The GENERIC form can be considered as a direct generalization of Hamiltonian equations for conserved dynamics and Ginzburg-Landau equations for dissipative dynamics. A big advantage of the GENERIC form is its description is applicable in both microscopic and macroscopic scales. This fact was understood in view of its geometric structure [35]. More recently, the authors proposed an alternative conservation-dissipation formalism based on the modern theory of hyperbolic equations [36], which offers a systematic way on choosing non-equilibrium state variables and determining evolution equations. Particularly, for the Markov processes described by the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation, master equation, or Fokker-Planck equation, the only conservation law is the sum of probability (or integral of probability density in the continuous case) over all values in the sample space is unity. As a consequence, in our case, the mechanical part becomes trivial and the heart of exploration concerns with the thermodynamic part.
The method utilized in this paper is relatively traditional. In recent years, as a novel generalization of classical probability theory, the large-deviation theory has been widely applied to various irreversible stochastic processes and shown a deep connection with non-equilibrium thermodynamics [37–39]. For instance, based on the large-deviation theory, it was proved that nonlinear chemical reaction systems could be rigorously derived from Markov jumping processes, during which the free energy function and its dissipation rate were preserved [40]. Furthermore, a connection between the large-deviation principle and gradient-flow structures for the motion of a Brownian particle described by F-P equations was established too [41].
There are several potential interesting generalizations of the current study:
• We note that the F-P equation is a special truncation of the master equation by just keeping the first two jump moments. Systematical explorations on high orders of truncation have been done and known as the Kramers equation in the literature [26]. It remains to show that a similar steady-state thermodynamic formalism could be defined and keeps in accordance with that of the master equation.
• Another non-trivial generalization is related to the quantum version of master equation, such as the Nakajima-Zwanzig equation in the exact form or Redfield equation and Lindbald equation in approximate forms [42]. In contrast to classical master equations, which are restricted to only diagonal elements, quantum master equations deal with the entire density matrix, including off-diagonal elements, and thus have far more fruitful contents.
• Although the Markovian models investigated in the current paper are all linear equations, the presence of a nonlinear Boltzmann entropy makes our derivation a non-trivial one. Either replacing the classical Boltzmann entropy by other non-extensive entropies, like the Tsallis entropy [43], or replacing the linear equations by nonlinear dynamics, such as the nonlinear Fokker-Planck equations or the Guldberg-Waage dynamics arising in chemical kinetics [40,44,45], would be of great interest.
APPENDIX: PROOF OF THEOREM 4.1
The limit of entropy production rate for the master equation is calculated in the main text, here we are going to prove remaining relations in Theorem 4.1, including the limit of entropy flow rate, adiabatic entropy production rate, non-adiabatic entropy production rate, and excess entropy change rate.
Proof. Note that the entropy flow rate, adiabatic entropy production rate, non-adiabatic entropy production rate, and excess entropy change rate for the master equation have a similar form, that is, the integrand is a product of the thermodynamic flux and a thermodynamic force. Then we have
where J^{M}(x, y, t) = W_{Ω}(x|y)P_{Ω}(y, t) − W_{Ω}(y|x)P_{Ω}(x, t) denotes the thermodynamic flux and A2M(x,y,t)=lnW_{Ω}(y|x)W_{Ω}(x|y), A3M(x,y,t)=lnW_{Ω}(x|y)PΩs(y)W_{Ω}(y|x)PΩs(x), A4M(x,y,t)=lnPΩs(x)P_{Ω}(y,t)PΩs(y)P_{Ω}(x,t), and A5M(x,y,t)=lnPΩs(y)PΩs(x) denote thermodynamic forces.Expand AiM(x,y,t)(i=2,3,4,5) into Taylor series with respect to X as
while the thermodynamic flux J^{M}(x, y, t) becomes
In the limit of Ω → ∞, the transition rates Φ_{i}(X, R) approach to delta functions with respect to the jump length R (since R = r/Ω → 0). Then
Since
the volume densities of the entropy flow rate and adiabatic entropy production rate for the master equation become
which emerge as the entropy flow rate and adiabatic entropy production rate for the corresponding F-P equation, respectively. Further note that I_{41}(X,R)/R=∂_{X}(lnp0s)−∂_{X}(lnp_{0}) and I_{51}(X,R)/R=−∂_{X}(lnp0s) are independent of R, we have
This completes the proof.
