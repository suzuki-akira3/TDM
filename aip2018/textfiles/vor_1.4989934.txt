Dynamic slip of polydisperse linear polymers using partitioned plate
The slip velocity of an industrial grade high molecular weight high-density polyethylene (HDPE) is studied in steady and dynamic shear experiments using a stress/strain controlled rotational rheometer equipped with a parallel partitioned plate geometry. Moreover, fluoroalkyl silane-based coating is used to understand the effect of surface energy on slip in steady and dynamic conditions. The multimode integral Kaye-Bernstein-Kearsley-Zapas constitutive model is applied to predict the transient shear response of the HDPE melt obtained from rotational rheometer. It is found that a dynamic slip model with a slip relaxation time is needed to adequately predict the experimental data at large shear deformations. Comparison of the results before and after coating shows that the slip velocity is largely affected by surface energy. Decreasing surface energy by coating increases slip velocity and decreases the slip relaxation time.
I. INTRODUCTION
The classical no-slip boundary condition of fluid mechanics is not a valid assumption for the flow of complex fluids including polymer melts [1–7]. Direct slip measurements using optical techniques have confirmed the slip theory developed by Brochard and de Gennes [2] that polymer melts slip no matter how small are the applied forces [8,9]. The slip velocity of polymer melts complicates analysis of rheological data, and it is necessary to be assessed for simulation of polymer processes and process optimization under both steady-state and dynamic conditions.
Most of the slip velocity models proposed in the literature are static models (no time-dependency), where slip depends only on the instantaneous value of wall shear stress [1,4,5,10,11]. Hatzikiriakos and Dealy [3] carried out shear experiments for high-density polyethylene (HDPE) using the sliding plate rheometer. They found that above a critical shear stress, polymer melt slips and the slip velocity, V_{S}, is a power-law function of wall shear stress written as
where A is the slip coefficient and m is the slip power law exponent. In a previous study [12], it was demonstrated that m = 1/n, where n is equal to the local slope of the flow curve of the corresponding polymer n≡d[log(σ_{w})]/d[log(γ̇{w})].
Static models can only predict the steady state slip behavior of polymer melts and they do not consider slip relaxation effects observed in transient flows [13,14]. Therefore, dynamic models must be used in transient conditions to address these slip relaxation effects. Pearson and Petrie [13] first proposed a memory (dynamic) slip model in which the slip velocity depends on the past states of the wall shear stress. They introduced a slip relaxation time, λs, to represent delayed slip as follows:
where f(σ_{w}) shows the slip dependency on wall shear stress based on the considered static slip model. By using a power-law slip model [3,10,12], Eq. (2) becomes
Hatzikiriakos and Kalogerakis [15] simulated the behavior of a polymer/wall interface by using a network kinetic theory, and performed Brownian dynamics, and thus developed a dynamic slip velocity model. Using this model, they predicted the steady-state slip of high-density polyethylene satisfactorily. However, they could only describe the slip dynamics qualitatively. Hatzikiriakos [16] extended this single-mode model to a multimode one to improve the predictions of the slip dynamics. Graham [14] studied large amplitude oscillatory shear flows of polymer melts between parallel plates and used a power-law dynamic slip model with non-zero slip yield stress. Its two-mode generalization reproduced experimental data reported by Hatzikiriakos and Dealy [3]. They suggested that both viscoelasticity and a dynamic slip model are necessary to explain the instabilities and nonlinear dynamics of polymer melts in oscillatory shear flows. Lan et_al [17] coupled the dynamic slip models with different nonlinear viscoelastic constitutive models, such as Wagner and Liu models [18,19], to study slip of a linear low-density polyethylene in both steady and unsteady flows using a sliding plate rheometer. They reported that the studied models predicted slip data in steady shear well but showed insufficient gap dependence in exponential shear. Kazatchkov and Hatzikiriakos [20] derived an integral dynamic slip model by analogy to the derivation of the generalized Maxwell model from its single-mode counterpart for viscoelasticity. They combined this modified slip model with Wagner’s constitutive equation to solve the transient shear response of a linear low-density polyethylene and observed improvement in predicting relevant experimental data. Kaoullas and Georgiou [21] derived analytical solutions for the start-up of Newtonian Poiseuille and Couette flows with dynamic wall slip. Their results revealed that under dynamic slip conditions, the slip velocity depends not only on the instantaneous value of the wall shear stress but also on its past states.
In this study, small angle oscillatory shear (SAOS), step strain relaxation, and uniaxial extension experiments were used to fully characterize rheologically a highly viscoelastic HDPE melt. Moreover, rotational rheometry using a parallel partitioned plate was used to study the slip velocity of a polydisperse HDPE melt in steady and unsteady flows. The Kaye-Bernstein-Kearsley-Zapas (K-BKZ) constitutive model under no slip, static slip, and dynamic slip conditions was used to predict the transient shear response of a HDPE melt. It was found that including the dynamic slip with a slip relaxation time is necessary to explain the transient shear response of the HDPE melt at large and fast shear deformations. Furthermore, fluoroalkyl silane-based coating using dip coating method was used to study the effects of surface energy on slip velocity including its dynamics. It was observed that the slip velocity is increased and the slip relaxation time is decreased by reducing surface energy.
II. EXPERIMENTAL
A. Rheological measurements
In this paper, the slip behavior of a high molecular weight HDPE supplied by ExxonMobil Chemical Company (with weight-average molecular weight, M_{w} = 212 kg/mol, and polydispersity index, PI ≡ M_{w}/M_{n} = 26, where M_{n} is the number-average molecular weight) is studied using a rotational rheometer. A stress/strain controlled Anton Paar MCR702 (with TwinDrive technology where the two plates can be rotated independently) rotational rheometer equipped with a 25-mm parallel plate geometry was used to study the linear viscoelastic (LVE) properties. The frequency sweep tests were carried out over a wide range of temperatures from 150 to 230 °C. The curves at different temperatures were shifted using the time-temperature superposition (tTS) to generate the master curves at the reference temperature of 190 °C at which slip experiments were performed.
Non-linear viscoelastic measurements were conducted using a parallel partitioned plate geometry mounted on Anton Paar MCR702 by performing step-strain stress relaxation experiments for shear strains ranging from 0.05 to 10. Start-up of steady shear experiments were also performed using different gaps in the range of 0.05–20 s^{−1}. The parallel partitioned plate geometry allows measuring the non-linear shear flow behavior of highly viscoelastic polymer melts, which suffer from edge fracture in conventional parallel plate geometries. Reliable data can be obtained with this system at high shear rates and strains by avoiding edge fracture effects [22,23]. In this fixture, another partition has been added, only to shield off the edge fracture. The top geometry consists of a standard 8 mm plate attached to the transducer (center plate), and a coaxial stationary ring (partitioned plate). The benefit of this setup is that the transducer takes into account only torque contributions from the center plate, thus the effects of the edge fracture are postponed to higher shear rates and strains. As shown in this paper, this new geometry enables studying the polymer slip velocity in transient flows at high shear rates.
Uniaxial extensional rheology measurements were performed at Hencky strain rates ranging from 0.5 to 10 s^{−1} at the reference temperature of 190 °C, using the second generation Sentmanat extensional rheometer (SER2) fixture compatible with Anton Paar MCR702. The two drums of this new generation fixture are rotated independently, thus avoiding the effect of friction possibly originating from the intermeshing gears used in the previous versions.
B. Surface energy
To alter the surface energy, the lower plate of the partitioned parallel plate geometry has been coated with fluoroalkyl silane using solution based dip-coating method. By this method, fluoro groups have been deposited on the surface, thus reducing the surface energy [24,25]. The silanization process occurs by hydrogen bonding between silane solution and hydroxyl groups on the substrate [26]. The alkylsilane coating used in this study are rather stable due to the cross-polymerization of alkylsilane chains [27].
III. MATHEMATICAL MODELLING
The K-BKZ constitutive model proposed by Papanastasiou et_al [28] and modified by Luo and Tanner [29] used in this study, is given by
where t is the current time, m(t − t′) is the memory function of linear viscoelasticity, and h(I_{C^{−1}},I_{C}) is the damping function. I_{C} and I_{C^{−1}} are the first invariants of the Cauchy–Green tensor C_{t}, and its inverse Finger strain tensor, Ct−1, θ is a material constant given by N_{2}/N_{1} = θ/(1 − θ), where N_{1} and N_{2} are first and second normal stress differences, respectively. The memory function is defined as
where λ_{i} and g_{i} are the relaxation times and relaxation moduli, respectively, and N is the number of relaxation modes.
The damping function can be determined by performing sudden step strain experiments and recording the relaxation shear stress data at various levels of imposed strains. The strain dependent damping function has many forms in the literature. Papanastasiou et_al [28] suggested the following equation, known as PSM (Papanastasiou, Scriven, Macosko) damping function,
where α and β are model constants to be determined from shear and elongational flow data, respectively. For the case of simple shear, I_{C}=I_{C^{−1}}=3+γ^{2}, and thus, the PSM damping function reduces to the following simple form:
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Rheological characterization
1. Small-amplitude oscillatory shear
Figure 1 presents the master curves of the linear viscoelastic moduli, G′ and G″, and complex viscosity, η*, of the studied HDPE melt at the reference temperature of 190 °C. Continuous lines represent the fit of the Maxwell relaxation model (6 modes) to the viscoelastic moduli. The fitted parameters, namely the relaxation times, λ_{i}, and the relaxation moduli, g_{i}, are listed in Table I.
2. Step-strain stress relaxation
Stress relaxation tests at various step strains from 0.05 to 10 were performed at T = 190 °C using the parallel partitioned plate geometry mounted on MCR 702 with gap, h_{p} = 0.75 mm. As previously mentioned, this fixture allows accurate measurement of rheological data of viscoelastic polymer melts at high shear rates and strains. Figure 2 shows the relaxation modulus data at different levels of step strains. The curves obtained at low values of step strains (γ ≤ 0.1) are independent of strain and are considered to represent the linear relaxation modulus. These curves agree well with the relaxation modulus obtained from relaxation spectrum using SAOS experiments. Curves for other strains are below the linear relaxation modulus, indicating the “dampening” of the linear response. By shifting the relaxation data in non-linear regime to superpose with the linear viscoelastic data, the damping function, h(γ), is determined using the following equation:
where G(t) and G(γ, t) are the linear and non-linear relaxation modulus, respectively. The determined damping function is plotted versus strain, γ, in Fig. 3, along with the PSM fitting [Eq. (7)] [28]. As depicted in Fig. 3, using α = 8.5 results in a satisfactory fit of the experimental data.
3. Uniaxial extension
Uniaxial extensional tests were conducted at T = 190 °C, at different Hencky strain rates ranging from 0.5 to 10 s^{−1} using the SER2 fixture. Figure 4 plots the uniaxial stress growth coefficient, ηE+ versus time, along with the K-BKZ model (PSM damping function) predictions. The optimum value of the “β” that fits the extensional data well is 0.45.
B. Static slip velocity
The slip velocity of the HDPE melt is studied using rotational rheometer equipped with the parallel partitioned plate geometry with different gaps between the parallel disks.
1. Slip velocity from rotational rheometry equipped with parallel partitioned plate
As discussed above, the newly developed partitioned plate has been used to study slip at higher shear rates. Start-up of steady shear experiments were performed for the HDPE melt at three different gaps, namely, 0.5, 0.75, and 1 mm. Figure 5, depicts the gap dependence of the shear stress growth coefficient response for all three gaps at the nominal shear rate of 20 s^{−1} (which is the average shear rate through the radius of the center plate, equal to 2ΩR3h_{p}, where Ω is the angular velocity, R is the radius of the center plate, and h_{p} is the gap between the upper and lower plates). Both the steady-state shear stress value and the maximum value of the overshoot scale with the gap spacing h_{p}. The gap dependence is consistent with the assumption of slip, and such data can be used to calculate the slip velocity by using a method described by Yoshimura and Prud’homme [30].
Figure 6 shows the flow curves (shear stress at the edge of the center disk, σ_{R} versus the nominal shear rate at the edge of the center disk, γ̇{nR}) of the HDPE melt at different gaps along with the LVE data. The nominal shear rate at the edge of the center plate away from the edge fracture is calculated from the following equation:
where γ̇{n} is the nominal shear rate, Ω is the angular velocity, R is the radius of the rotating plate (center plate), and h_{p} is the gap between the upper and lower plates. The shear stress at the edge of the center plate, σ_{R}, is determined by differentiating the torque, T with respect to γ̇{nR} as follows:
It can be seen form Fig. 6, that the stress response at large values of shear rate is gap dependent. Moreover, a considerable deviation from the curve indicated as LVE is observed at large shear deformations. These data can be used to calculate the slip velocity as a function of shear stress by using the Mooney analysis or deviation from the LVE curve [4,6,31,32]. The Mooney analysis for parallel plates is outlined by the following equation [33]:
where γ̇{R} is the true shear rate at the edge. In parallel, slip velocities were calculated from the deviation of each flow curve from the LVE curve by using the following relationship:
The slip data calculated from these two methods are plotted together in Fig. 7. Very good agreement between the data obtained from these two methods is found.
Similarly, the deviation from the LVE curve was used to calculate the slip velocity of the HDPE after coating the lower plate with fluoroalkylsilane by taking into account that only one plate is treated using VSl=h_{p}(γ̇{nR}−ω)−V_{S}, where VSl is the slip velocity on treated lower plate and V_{S} is the slip velocity on clean/untreated upper plate, which is known from previous experiment. The start-up of shear tests were performed for a gap of 0.75 mm at different values of nominal shear rate. The slip data calculated from deviation of flow curve after silanization from the LVE curve are added into Fig. 7. As expected, silanization has increased the polymer slip velocity in agreement with data previously reported in literature [34,35].
2. Slip modelling based on double reptation theory
In our previous studies [12,36], elements from the theory of double reptation were used to relate the slip velocity of several unimodal HDPEs with their molecular weights and molecular weight distributions. The developed general model proposed to predict slip velocity is as follows (for a given temperature and level of pressure):
where W_{adh} and W_{adh,e} are the work of adhesions before and after coating [37]. Therefore, (W_{adh}/W_{adh,e}) equals to 1 for the untreated surface and ∼3.5 for the silanized surface, respectively [35,38].A′ and β are constants, which depend on the polymer structure and found to be 1.0 × 10^{10} and −2, respectively, for HDPEs [12,39]. Consolidating the molecular weight, temperature, pressure, and surface treatment effects, this model can be simplified as Eq. (1) with m = 1/n. The calculated slip velocities of the studied HDPE resin on clean/untreated and silanized surfaces based on double reptation theory [Eq. (13)] are depicted in Fig. 7 with solid lines. As can be seen from this figure, excellent agreement between the experimental and the calculated slip velocities is observed.
C. Dynamic slip velocity
As discussed, the static slip velocity models imply that the slip velocity adjusts instantaneously to the wall shear stress and they do not consider slip relaxation effects observed in transient flows. Therefore, dynamic models must be used in transient conditions to address these slip relaxation effects. By using Eq. (13) as the static slip model and coupling Eqs. (2) and (13), the following relation is obtained which includes the shear stress dependence of the slip velocity, molecular weight and its distribution, surface energy, as well as slip relaxation effects:
This model includes both the dynamic and the steady response of slip. In order to check the applicability of the proposed model in predicting the transient response of polymer melts in start-up of shear experiments, the K-BKZ model (PSM damping function) is coupled with Eq. (14) and the predictions are compared with relevant experimental data.
1. Start-up of steady shear (untreated surfaces)
Figure 8 shows the shear stress growth coefficient, ηS+, of the HDPE melt at different nominal shear rates of 0.05, 0.5, and 1 s^{−1} using the parallel partitioned plate geometry with gap, h_{p} = 0.75 mm at the temperature of 190 °C along with the K-BKZ PSM model predictions under no slip condition. Very good agreement between model prediction and experimental results is observed, as no significant slippage was detected at these small values of shear deformations using rotational rheometer. In other words, slip is small enough that does not manifest itself in these macroscopic measurements. However, at the higher nominal shear rate of 5 s^{−1} steady and dynamic slip effects become evident [Fig. 9(a)]. The K-BKZ PSM model predictions under no slip, static slip, and dynamic slip conditions using the optimum value of λ_{S} that best describes the experimental data are also shown in Fig. 9(a). At this higher shear rate, the slip becomes sizable from the macroscopic point of view and the K-BKZ PSM model under the assumption of no-slip overpredicts the experimental results. Therefore, the steady state slip is considered by coupling the K-BKZ PSM model with the static slip model [Eq. (13)]. As shown in Fig. 9, the predictions are improved and the K-BKZ PSM model under static slip condition can predict the steady-state value accurately. However, it fails to capture the overshoot response of the polymer, and a dynamic slip velocity model is needed to predict the transient shear response and the overshoot. The model prediction using the dynamic slip model with slip relaxation time, λ_{S} = 0.224 s fits the experimental data very well. Therefore, a dynamic slip model [Eq. (14)] coupled with the K-BKZ model is necessary in predicting both the steady-state and transient behavior of the studied HDPE melt. Similar results are reported for the nominal shear rates of 10 and 20 s^{−1} in Fig. 9(b), confirming the applicability of the K-BKZ model under dynamic slip condition in accurately predicting the experimental results at high shear rates using the same value of λ_{S} = 0.224 s.
2. Start-up of steady shear (silanized surfaces)
As mentioned, the lower plate of parallel partitioned plate geometry was coated with fluoroalkyl silane using a solution based dip-coating method in order to alter the surface energy and thus the slip behavior of the polymer. The hypothesis was to examine if the slip relaxation time was still the same. A different relaxation time would imply a different slip mechanism. The shear stress response of HDPE at the nominal shear rate of 10 s^{−1} for clean/untreated and silanized lower plate is demonstrated in Fig. 10. It is clear that silanization has increased the slip velocity resulting in a decrease of steady state shear stress [35]. Moreover, the magnitude of overshoot and its location has been changed in the presence of coating. A different value of slip relaxation time, λ_{S} = 0.107 s has been calculated to fit the experimental data in the presence of coating. In the case of silanized substrate, silanization reduces the surface energy and thus the adhesion of polymer chains to the surface. Note that in the case of clean/untreated surface, the number of entanglements between the adsorbed layer and the bulk molecules play a role, i.e., slip is a result of disentanglement of the chains in the bulk from the chains adsorbed next to the solid boundary known as cohesive failure. In the case of silanization, these entanglements are significantly reduced and the mechanism of slip is mostly governed by direct desorption of the chains next to the silanized surface (adhesive failure) [6]. Therefore, in this case, weaker bonds are formed on the surface and the slip velocity is increased resulting in decrease in the steady-state value of shear stress. Moreover, polymer chains relax more readily and surface bonds are ruptured under lower strains resulting in the faster overshoot of shear stress [40]. The fitted stress relaxation time is reduced from λ_{S} = 0.224 s for the clean/untreated surface to λ_{S} = 0.107 s for the silanized surface.
V. CONCLUSIONS
In this study, the slip behavior of a HDPE melt was studied in steady and unsteady flows. The slip velocity was calculated using a rotational rheometer with a parallel partitioned plate geometry which allows accurate measurements at high shear strains and rates by postponing edge fracture [22]. Moreover, silanization was applied in order to change the surface energy. The double reptation mixing rule was used to predict the slip velocity [12], and very good agreement was observed between experimental data and calculated results (refer to Fig. 7).
Start-up of steady shear experiments at various values of shear rate were performed, and a constitutive equation, K-BKZ model with PSM damping function, under no slip, static slip, and dynamic slip conditions was used to predict the transient shear response of the HDPE melt. Our results show that at higher shear rates (≥5 s^{−1}), where slip becomes sizable from the macroscopic point of view, although a static slip model can accurately predict the steady state shear values, it fails to predict the overshoot that occurs during start-up. Therefore, a dynamic slip model is needed to preserve the dynamics of the flow, i.e., predict the size and location of the overshoot correctly. By silanization of the substrate and reducing surface energy, the slip velocity is increased and the slip relaxation time is reduced. The fitted stress relaxation time is changed from λ_{S} = 0.224 s for clean/untreated surface to λ_{S} = 0.107 s for silanized surface indicating also that the slip mechanism in both cases is different, i.e., disentaglement (cohesive failure) in the case of clean/untreated surfaces versus direct desorption (adhesive failure) in the case of silanised surfaces.
